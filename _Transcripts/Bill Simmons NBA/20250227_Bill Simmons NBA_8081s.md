# A Cooper Flagg-asm, Bill’s Best Celtics Ever, NBA Trends & Lorne Michaels | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw)
*  The Bill Simmons podcast is presented by Fandule Sportsbook. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=0.0s)]
*  We did this big docu-series for Max and HBO that premieres on March 3rd, Monday. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4.12s)]
*  It is about the Boston Celtics. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=10.08s)]
*  It is about eight decades, how they intersect with the NBA and the city of Boston and [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=11.76s)]
*  America and all the great players and robberies and feuds. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=16.8s)]
*  And we're all really proud of it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=19.76s)]
*  So Monday, March 3rd, it's coming. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=21.44s)]
*  In the meantime, I have a little pyramid for you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Celtics pyramid. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=27.68s)]
*  I narrowed it to 15 players and we're going to do it right now. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=29.32s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  Uh, 15 players and the catch is it has to be the Celtics version of them. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=33.36s)]
*  So this isn't like Kevin Garnett. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=39.92s)]
*  I'm not taking Kevin Garnett's whole career. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=41.52s)]
*  It's just Kevin Garnett on the Celtics. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=43.2s)]
*  Anyway, pyramid, top level, one guy, Bill Russell. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=45.6s)]
*  I have him as the number three all time guy. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=49.44s)]
*  11 to 13 titles, the most important on and off court NBA star ever relevant. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=51.32s)]
*  Um, greatest winner in the history of sports also relevant. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=57.36s)]
*  He's at the top. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=60.36s)]
*  Next to Larry Bird, John Havlicek. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=61.6s)]
*  I don't need to make the case for Larry Bird. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=64.0s)]
*  I have him as the six best guy ever. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=65.48s)]
*  Three-star MVP's, three titles, but here's a fun Larry Bird fact. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  MVP from 1980 to 1988, fourth, second, second, second, first, first, first, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=71.08s)]
*  third, second, that's over nine years. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=77.88s)]
*  That's over nine years. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=80.08s)]
*  Larry Bird was amazing. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=81.0s)]
*  And he, I think he even would have been better now. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=82.32s)]
*  John Havlicek in the running for most underrated NBA superstar of all time. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  Eight titles, 25,000 points played 16 years, which is like playing 25 years now. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=89.16s)]
*  I don't know how he did it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=96.56s)]
*  His three year peak, 27, nine and eight, his four year playoff peak, 27, nine and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=97.56s)]
*  six, uh, was one of the most clutch players of his era, if not the number two clutch [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=103.28s)]
*  guy behind Jerry West and the greatest thing about him, all time Swiss army knife [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=108.12s)]
*  guy, uh, had this whole career as a six man, uh, he could play guard, he could [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=112.0s)]
*  play forward, whatever your team needed. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=117.28s)]
*  He could do it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=119.92s)]
*  And then eventually, uh, he ended up as a forward during the last couple of titles, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=120.72s)]
*  but there's never been a career quite like that where you're just winning when [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=124.56s)]
*  you come in, you're winning when you leave. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=128.4s)]
*  And then the next level. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=130.52s)]
*  So Bob Cousy, if I had to do a Mount Rushmore, he would be the fourth guy for [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=132.16s)]
*  that six rings, won an MVP, best non center of the first 15 years of the league. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=135.36s)]
*  The first fun, entertaining player in the history of the league. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=140.60000000000002s)]
*  That's relevant. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=143.84s)]
*  Uh, first grade, great point guard ever relevant. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=144.96s)]
*  10 first all MBAs, two second, all MBAs. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=148.52s)]
*  He was just a dominant player by the time he retired. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=150.96s)]
*  He was basically the Babe Ruth of the league when he retired. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  And then he passed the torch to his teammate Russell and Elgin and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=157.08s)]
*  Wilton, every everybody else. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=160.0s)]
*  But that's the top four. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=162.32000000000002s)]
*  So the other two on that level that I would put Dave Cowans, who, um, was one of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=163.6s)]
*  the most important players of the seventies, won an MVP, won a couple of titles. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=169.0s)]
*  And, you know, the seventies Celtics or the seventies Knicks, those were the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=172.48s)]
*  best two teams of that decade. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=176.24s)]
*  And he was the most important player, him or Havlicek at least for [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=178.4s)]
*  this entire Celtics run. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=182.32s)]
*  So he's on there. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=183.56s)]
*  And then Sam Jones, who's another underrated all time guy, um, who didn't [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=184.28s)]
*  even really get to start cause the league was so stacked, they had like eight [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=188.88s)]
*  teams, nine teams. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=192.64s)]
*  He was coming off the bench behind Bill Sharman, who was also awesome. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=193.64s)]
*  Didn't get to start till like the last two thirds of his career, but is one of [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=197.55999999999997s)]
*  the great clutch players in the history of the league, even now, and made all [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=201.95999999999998s)]
*  kinds of crazy shots. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=205.76s)]
*  We covered some of them in the documentary. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=206.83999999999997s)]
*  So, uh, Russell, then Burden Havlicek, then Koozie Cowans and Sam Jones, then [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=209.76s)]
*  these next four pretty easy, Kevin McHale, um, who is one of the 40 best players of [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=214.56s)]
*  all time. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=220.24s)]
*  And, uh, I think if he doesn't hurt his foot, maybe even can climb up into a [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=221.28s)]
*  potential, I don't know, in the twenties. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=227.24s)]
*  I don't think it's out of the realm that he could have been in a KG [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=230.04000000000002s)]
*  Barkley area, um, but was never able to recover from all the, all the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=233.4s)]
*  playoff games they played, but, uh, best little post player I've ever seen him [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=238.28s)]
*  in a team, Paul Pierce, the title changes everything for him, right? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=241.56s)]
*  If they don't, if the KG trade doesn't happen, who knows what happens with the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=248.0s)]
*  second part of Paul Pierce's career. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=251.28s)]
*  Instead, he belatedly develops into this awesome playoff guy, uh, crunch time [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=253.32s)]
*  guy down the stretch and just has this whole second career, uh, also really [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=259.6s)]
*  durable and, uh, and, and an excellent score and went head to head against [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=263.64s)]
*  LeBron a lot and his teams won against LeBron at, uh, you know, not a, not a [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=268.44s)]
*  super young point in LeBron's career either. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=275.56s)]
*  So he's in there. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=277.24s)]
*  Jason Tatum, who I think, so right now I have him fourth level and I have him [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=278.12s)]
*  ninth overall, uh, had definitely has a chance to leapfrog a couple of these [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=282.64s)]
*  guys pretty soon, I think, especially if they won back to back titles this year. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=287.32s)]
*  I think he has to go into the top six at that point. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  Bill Sharman, who was the best two guard in the league for the first 15 years of [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=294.2s)]
*  the league, Warren's mentioning just first team all NBA year after year, uh, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=298.68s)]
*  good score and also weirdly, I think people seem to think he was the toughest [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=303.0s)]
*  guy from that era, he was just cold cock people for the hell they, I didn't, I [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=307.8s)]
*  didn't like the way you set that pick of me, I'm just punching you. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=310.91999999999996s)]
*  So I'm putting him in there and then the final level, the last five, Kevin [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=313.52s)]
*  Garnett, who was only with the Celtics for six years, but, um, that O-8 team [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=317.44s)]
*  and then the first half of 2009, they make the 2010 finals, they almost make [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=322.24s)]
*  it again in 12 and, uh, a beloved Celtic too, I think the most popular Celtics. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=326.64s)]
*  Since my dad has had season tickets now since the 73, 74 season bird was the most [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=332.68s)]
*  popular and I really think the next two were probably Cowlens and Garnett in some [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=337.2s)]
*  order, and I don't know who was ahead of who, but in terms of just beloved by the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=344.32s)]
*  crowd and the fans Garnett has to be up there. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=349.36s)]
*  Tommy Heintzen only played for like eight or nine years because this [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=351.44s)]
*  was the smoking drinking era. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=354.96s)]
*  I think they were just having cigarettes at their timeouts, but, uh, was an [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=356.8s)]
*  awesome, awesome forward and a big score rebounder came through a couple of times [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=361.2s)]
*  in the playoffs outplayed some forwards that really good like Bob Pettit. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=366.08s)]
*  So he's in there, Robert Parrish, 13 years, I think with the Celtics, maybe 14. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=369.68s)]
*  Three titles, uh, wasn't on that Kareem level as a center, but was on that second [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=375.68s)]
*  level. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=380.88s)]
*  I think he even had a second team on NBA. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=381.15999999999997s)]
*  So he's on there. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=382.84s)]
*  Jojo White, another guy really underrated from the seventies. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=383.8s)]
*  Uh, I had him in the pyramid when I did my book in 2009 and had his most famous [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=388.35999999999996s)]
*  moment other than winning two titles was the, uh, triple overtime game, which is [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=393.47999999999996s)]
*  one of the great performances by a non-superstar that we've ever had in the finals. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=397.88s)]
*  I think he played 60 of the 63 minutes. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=402.79999999999995s)]
*  I went to that game. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=405.0s)]
*  I barely remember it, but, uh, there was the famous image of him just sitting on [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=406.76s)]
*  the court at the end because he was so wiped out, but he was just a real, he was [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=411.2s)]
*  just a top 10 NBA player for six, seven years. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=416.0s)]
*  I mean, Jalen Brown's my last guy. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=418.88s)]
*  I think he belongs. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=420.88s)]
*  You win a title. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=421.76s)]
*  You win a title. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=422.47999999999996s)]
*  He wins finals, MVP, the durability with him. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=423.28s)]
*  The fact that in the 2020s, this team is just relevant year after year because of [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=427.03999999999996s)]
*  the Tatum Brown connection, I think he has to be in there. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=431.59999999999997s)]
*  So toughest cuts for me, Paul Silas, Dennis Johnson, Cedric Maxwell, Ray Allen, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=434.15999999999997s)]

*  So that's the podcast. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=551.5600000000001s)]
*  First, our friends from Pearl Jam. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=552.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=560.32s)]
*  Jake, how man is here from the ringer hasn't been down in a while. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=576.5200000000001s)]
*  Miss talking hoops of them. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=579.32s)]
*  I was waiting to pull the Cooper flag rip cord with him. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=580.84s)]
*  And, uh, and then this week, Jim Bayheim compared him to Larry Baird. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=584.0400000000001s)]
*  And I was like, all right, let's, let's officially have the combo. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=587.0s)]
*  That was what tipped the scales. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=589.84s)]
*  You couldn't, you couldn't do it anymore. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=591.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=593.12s)]
*  I was going to wait till we got to March madness, but now I, you know, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=593.28s)]
*  it couldn't even make it out of February. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=596.44s)]
*  Um, he's gotten better every week. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=598.16s)]
*  The highlights have been fun. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=600.96s)]
*  The game situations have been fun. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=602.4s)]
*  It's crazy that he's only 18 years old and is the all around guy that he's, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=604.52s)]
*  uh, already seems like he's becoming a Duke. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=609.64s)]
*  I think people are raising their ceilings to him. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=612.5600000000001s)]
*  I hate the word generational. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=615.6800000000001s)]
*  It feels like it's getting thrown around too much. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=616.88s)]
*  I think a better word is just unique. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=619.76s)]
*  There's just not prospects like this anymore who are as good on both ends [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=622.16s)]
*  and as additive all over the place. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=626.36s)]
*  And I'm trying to debate how excited to get about this because as you know, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=628.88s)]
*  these are my type of players that I I'm just trying to make everyone better. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=632.84s)]
*  I'm just super competitive. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=636.88s)]
*  How can I fit in? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=638.12s)]
*  Like these are my favorite guys. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=639.08s)]
*  So how excited do I get comment? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=640.72s)]
*  Well, first I was going to add you talking about Jim Bayheim. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=643.64s)]
*  He, I, whenever I watch broadcasts that he's on, he always kind of sounds to me [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=646.72s)]
*  like an uncle who just ate Thanksgiving dinner and he's just kind of lean back [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=651.2s)]
*  and making groggy comments about the game. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=654.72s)]
*  Like, and he just makes me laugh throughout the games. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=657.64s)]
*  Uh, I'm glad he's on there though. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=660.2s)]
*  He's good. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=661.36s)]
*  Um, yeah, well, I mean, you're talking about your preferences and players and [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=661.84s)]
*  things, I mean, what you're describing is winning. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=665.96s)]
*  I mean, who doesn't like to win? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=668.44s)]
*  I know you like to win Bill. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=669.84s)]
*  Uh, I do too, you know? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=671.32s)]
*  So, and I think you're talking about the difference between generational and unique. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=673.28s)]
*  I think what sets Cooper apart is, you know, we have seen, uh, I'll say [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=678.32s)]
*  the buzz buzzword toolsy guys. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=683.32s)]
*  We've seen guys who check a lot of boxes and are two way players, but I think. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=685.48s)]
*  Cooper who does check those boxes and we can talk about it more in detail. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=690.2s)]
*  Something that is unique about him is that I think that he has those things [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=693.64s)]
*  that you don't normally see as an, in an 18 year old, he's carrying one of the [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=697.0s)]
*  heaviest loads in college basketball. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=700.12s)]
*  Uh, I had it pulled up here. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=702.12s)]
*  His usage this year is 30.5%. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=703.68s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=706.8s)]
*  Uh, yeah. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=707.16s)]
*  And his assist usage is 0.83, but he's also averaging almost 20 points per game. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=707.92s)]
*  So you're just kind of like, how is that? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=713.88s)]
*  So that just tells you that like he's watering a lot of plants and [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=715.52s)]
*  he's watering his own plants. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=718.76s)]
*  He's just, he's doing everything for them and still being really efficient at it. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=720.12s)]
*  But the thing that sets him apart, I think with that wide foundation is that, and I [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=724.52s)]
*  wrote about this on the ring or not long ago in a profile I did on him. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=728.8s)]
*  I've already, I'm getting Cooper out because I've talked about him so much [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=731.7199999999999s)]
*  and mid college, but he has the potential to evolve, I think into like a heavy [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=735.7199999999999s)]
*  load carrying superstar at the next level. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=740.52s)]
*  I think some things need to happen for that, for that to pan out for him. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=742.9599999999999s)]
*  But I think that's what makes him unique is that, and you're right. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=746.52s)]
*  I think he could go on to any team and he could be like a, like a Scottie Pippen [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=749.4799999999999s)]
*  type to a superstar, which I think is the most likely scenario for him. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=753.3199999999999s)]
*  But I totally wouldn't rule out him becoming somebody that does who you just [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=756.9599999999999s)]
*  depend on as your hub for everything. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=761.04s)]
*  Cause he's, he's, he could evolve in so many different ways. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=762.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=765.88s)]
*  If you're creating a stretch for slash forward guy for the whatever, however, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=766.16s)]
*  we've played basketball now, it would probably look something like this, right? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=772.04s)]
*  Maybe you'd make them an inch taller. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=775.48s)]
*  What is he six, seven and a half without sneakers? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=776.8s)]
*  That's maybe six, six, eight. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=779.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=780.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=781.48s)]
*  Maybe he grew. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=781.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=782.7199999999999s)]
*  So maybe you'd add an inch there, but he's got the long arms, but this is [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=783.0s)]
*  everything you want for somebody next to some sort of big man who could have his [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=786.8s)]
*  hands around the rim and do, and do all that stuff. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=791.88s)]
*  When you try to compare them to people, bird is the obvious one that everyone [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=795.12s)]
*  keeps like Bayon did just cause it's, it's a white guy who does a lot of stuff. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=798.3199999999999s)]
*  Um, there's more Tatum with me than I think maybe, and maybe there's a [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=802.48s)]
*  Duke parallel with them too, but the, the way the Celtics use Tatum now. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=807.68s)]
*  As a point forward who can defend all these different positions on defense. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=812.2s)]
*  I feel like that's going to be flags destiny. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=816.3199999999999s)]
*  The difference is when Tatum came into the league, we knew he had a chance to be [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=819.0799999999999s)]
*  like a special player, but there were so many things that still needed to happen [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=823.1999999999999s)]
*  with him. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=826.88s)]
*  He, he was a score. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=827.24s)]
*  He felt a little Durant ish, but there wasn't any semblance of the passing game [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=828.4399999999999s)]
*  that he has now or the defensive level that he's gone up to, or even how, how [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=833.64s)]
*  much better of a rebounder he is. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=837.9599999999999s)]
*  Flags kind of already doing all those things. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=839.76s)]
*  And I just don't know what he looks like when he's 25. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=841.9599999999999s)]
*  Because I assume he's just going to keep working as three point shot and [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=846.28s)]
*  eventually he'll just be like a 40 to 45% three point shooter. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=849.92s)]
*  I assume he'll add a couple of low post things. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=853.36s)]
*  I assume he'll get really good at passing out at double teams, but for the most [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=855.88s)]
*  part to be this close to a finished product at age 18 from a skill standpoint, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=859.4s)]
*  that's what's so unusual. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=864.24s)]
*  I think. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=865.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's, it's really, I mean, it's really, really well rounded. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=866.56s)]
*  You mentioned, I mean, the bird thing is funny just because Cooper, I think as [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=869.4399999999999s)]
*  you know, grew up with a heavy Boston. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=873.12s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=875.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=875.8000000000001s)]
*  He got, he got indoctrinated in the 86, Celts highlights from his, his great mom. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=876.0400000000001s)]
*  One of the great moms of the last 40 years, showing them highlights. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=881.2s)]
*  Have you ever heard clips of his mom talk? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=884.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=886.9200000000001s)]
*  She, she would, they would be like driving in the car, watching like a DVD [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=887.08s)]
*  player and she had like old Celtic games because she wanted them to play like that. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=891.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=896.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=896.64s)]
*  Those old, those old portable DVD players. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=896.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=899.2800000000001s)]
*  He, it's funny because yeah, he has this heavy kind of Boston connection [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=899.72s)]
*  and I'm sure you would rather be good now than be bad and try to get flag. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=904.96s)]
*  It's, it's probably, it's a worthy trade, but I mean, he, he, he has, if you [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=908.4399999999999s)]
*  want to like compare him to Tatum, I think they have body kind of differences [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=912.92s)]
*  that are, that are really affecting the way that they play, like Tatum came into [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=918.12s)]
*  the league, I think is more of a guy who leaned towards being like a shot creator. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=922.2s)]
*  I think he has like a lower center center of gravity and he's a little bit more [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=926.12s)]
*  of a wiggly athlete. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=929.88s)]
*  He has like really big broad shoulders and got downhill a lot and things [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=931.16s)]
*  like that Cooper Cooper, I think is not quite the wiggly ball handler that [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=934.84s)]
*  Tatum was at the same age, but I think the thing that is so promising is when [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=939.24s)]
*  you watch him and you watched him at like Montverde and you watched him when [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=944.2s)]
*  he was growing up, Hey, he's like, he played as a big guy who would kind of be [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=947.76s)]
*  in the middle of the floor and would make those decisions that you and I have [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=952.2s)]
*  talked about on this show, myriad times where he will get in the middle of the [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=955.48s)]
*  floor, he'll take a quick snapshot of what, where the spacing is on the floor. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=960.0400000000001s)]
*  And he was really, really good at making those kind of short roll, like [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=964.5600000000001s)]
*  connective passes or come off a pin down. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=968.24s)]
*  What was really funny is that like Montverde used to run this very bird [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=971.08s)]
*  esque pin down on the block for him. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=975.28s)]
*  And they, and they still are doing it at Duke a little bit because he's lethal [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=977.5600000000001s)]
*  in the middle of the floor right now. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=980.92s)]
*  So I think if you look at the way that he's able to read the floor in that [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=982.12s)]
*  sense, and then you see him kind of fledgling and blossoming as a, as a ball [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=985.6s)]
*  handler, like I said, Tatum is ahead of him, but I think Cooper is way ahead of [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=989.72s)]
*  Tatum as a processor of the floor at the same age. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=993.68s)]
*  And if you look at the gap between those two things and you see where Tatum is [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=997.76s)]
*  and you see Cooper's brain, his skillset, and you say, okay, well, what's the [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1001.3199999999999s)]
*  difference there? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1004.92s)]
*  And this is the argument I made in the piece. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1005.9599999999999s)]
*  The difference, the distance there is just his handle. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1007.64s)]
*  I really do believe that's all it is. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1009.88s)]
*  And if you look at the way you're talking about his mom, you're talking [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1011.52s)]
*  about his basketball family, if you look at the way he has courted challenges in [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1014.2399999999999s)]
*  his career since the time we followed him, every indication is that this guy [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1018.92s)]
*  is a maniac worker. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1024.52s)]
*  He went to Duke a year early. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1025.96s)]
*  He left Maine a year early after like two years there where he was just [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1027.36s)]
*  dominating, actually might've just been a year. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1031.04s)]
*  And he's just way ahead of schedule by design and he's, he's, he's just an [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1033.0s)]
*  insane worker. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1038.4s)]
*  So I expect him to bridge that gap and improve his handle. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1038.92s)]
*  That's the number one thing with him. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1041.64s)]
*  And that's the thing you read from literally everybody who passes through his [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1043.4s)]
*  life in some capacity is maniac competitor. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1047.04s)]
*  They say that over and over again. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1049.52s)]
*  And the older I get, the more I feel like whether it's football, basketball, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1050.8799999999999s)]
*  name of sport, that's the number. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1054.6399999999999s)]
*  If you really want to be truly great, that's the number one quality that [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1056.52s)]
*  everybody seems to have just maniac competitor, maniac competitor wants it so [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1060.12s)]
*  bad. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1063.8799999999999s)]
*  Oh, he's not that great at this yet. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1064.36s)]
*  He's just going to keep going and going until he can go up a level. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1065.84s)]
*  And I I'm with you. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1069.84s)]
*  Like if you were going to use him as a point forward, I don't think his ball [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1070.84s)]
*  handling is good enough. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1074.96s)]
*  To do that in the NBA right now, but he's 18, but it's one of those things that I [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1077.04s)]
*  could just see him. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1081.8799999999999s)]
*  He's like, all right, I got to work on this. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1082.6s)]
*  I'm going to absolutely be a psycho and work on this constantly. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1084.1599999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1087.92s)]
*  I got to work on catching shoot threes. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1088.2s)]
*  I'm going to just shoot 10,000 of these until I get it. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1089.96s)]
*  I just think that's who he is and all the best guys ever. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1092.72s)]
*  And not that he has a chance to be that good, but all the best guys ever had that. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1096.8s)]
*  So if you're adding that whoever gets them, and I'm already worried about the [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1100.48s)]
*  lottery, because there's a couple of teams where I'm like, oh man, I just don't [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1104.4s)]
*  want him to go there. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1107.1200000000001s)]
*  You know, like, which ones? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1108.52s)]
*  Well, I, you know, like, I don't want him to go to like a bad team where we had [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1110.3600000000001s)]
*  this NBA infection that we've had for 50, 60 years, where we take these great [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1115.64s)]
*  talented players and just stick them in bad situations. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1120.76s)]
*  Like like what happened with LeBron in Cleveland the first couple of years, or [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1123.4s)]
*  he's done the worst possible team. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1126.6000000000001s)]
*  And he turned out to, you know, it turned out great for him, but you just lose a [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1128.4s)]
*  couple of years. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1131.88s)]
*  The best case scenario is what happened with Bird. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1132.48s)]
*  There's no scenario like that this year in the NBA that that could happen, but [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1134.8s)]
*  Bird goes to the 79, 80 Celtics and they already have like good players. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1138.0s)]
*  They go from 29 wins to 60 plus, but they had really good players in that team and [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1141.96s)]
*  he just elevated all of them. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1146.76s)]
*  So, you know, like, I don't think Portland could get in there, but I think [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1149.52s)]
*  Portland is, is a team that, you know, if he was on a team like that, that would be [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1153.1200000000001s)]
*  really interesting. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1157.92s)]
*  Philly. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1158.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1159.88s)]
*  You know, if somehow Embiid came back, if they, if they were able to stay in the [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1160.32s)]
*  top six, San Antonio would be the dream of all the teams, putting him next to Wemby. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1164.44s)]
*  I can't think of a better like sidekick for Wemby, assuming Wemby is going to be [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1169.92s)]
*  all right next year. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1173.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1174.4s)]
*  Um, they have a couple of bites at the apple, but when you start talking about [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1174.64s)]
*  like just throwing them on Washington, I don't know how many of the guys in the [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1177.28s)]
*  Wizards are even going to be in that team in three years, you know, you really [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1180.3600000000001s)]
*  want to build around him in the right way. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1183.2s)]
*  That'd be a crazy collection of like athletes, I would say over the, over the [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1184.96s)]
*  short amount of time. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1188.6000000000001s)]
*  Like if they picked up Kula Bali and then picked up SAR and then picked up [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1189.44s)]
*  some juries out on SAR, but I think if, yeah, adding flag to that, the only thing [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1192.76s)]
*  I would, the only thing I would say that I think is a little bit of a twist. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1196.2s)]
*  You mentioned LeBron and I think LeBron is in this category is that some players, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1199.4s)]
*  when you come into, when they come into the league, I look at them and I think [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1203.3600000000001s)]
*  there's a lot there, but the conditions and the context of where he goes is [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1207.3200000000002s)]
*  really, really going to affect how he develops. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1212.6000000000001s)]
*  Cooper, I think is a context. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1215.64s)]
*  Some guys are like, they're just culture setters, you know, Tim Duncan, I'm not, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1218.28s)]
*  you know, this is like hallow get struck by lightning type thing I'm going to say [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1222.96s)]
*  here, but you know, Steph, LeBron, those, those are the types of guys who just [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1226.04s)]
*  have winning habits. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1230.16s)]
*  They demand the most of everybody. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1231.48s)]
*  I, I had a funny conversation with, I had a funny conversation with a friend of mine [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1233.76s)]
*  and he'll know that I'm talking about him when I say this, but he was telling, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1238.36s)]
*  he's a, he's a physician and he was, but he, and he does surgery and he was telling [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1242.8s)]
*  me whenever in his operating room, he said he sets the tone to the point, the [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1246.16s)]
*  level of excellence to the point where the stupid people and the lazy people [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1251.88s)]
*  don't want to be in the room with him because they know they're going to be [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1255.5600000000002s)]
*  accountable. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1258.0800000000002s)]
*  And I just started laughing and I was just like, that's what great people do is [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1259.0800000000002s)]
*  like, you kind of, if you're going to be in the room with them, you know, you have [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1263.2s)]
*  to kind of elevate your game. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1265.76s)]
*  And I think that Cooper is that type of guy, but I think you're right, man. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1267.68s)]
*  He like, he, he, and I think he's willing to sort of fit into any kind of scenario [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1270.2s)]
*  wherever he goes and the shooting is going to come along. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1274.76s)]
*  Like that, that's, that's the only other thing I would add to is if you go back [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1276.92s)]
*  and people should go watch this, we've known Cooper for probably four years in [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1281.28s)]
*  the mainstream, you can go watch his games from when he was a freshman and a [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1284.84s)]
*  sophomore in high school. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1288.92s)]
*  He was shooting like set shot in the driveway, three pointers, the, the [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1290.4s)]
*  distance that he has come in the three or four years since we've known him is [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1294.3600000000001s)]
*  remarkable. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1299.2s)]
*  Like he was just a run around deer block shots guy when he first came on the scene [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1300.16s)]
*  and he's become a full fledged handler in college, in a tough conference. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1304.36s)]
*  Well, the ACC sucks, but tough competition. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1307.8799999999999s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1310.4399999999998s)]
*  Cause one of the guys that he reminds me of, he has nothing in common with [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1310.9599999999998s)]
*  physically really, but it's KG. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1314.76s)]
*  Cause KG was seven foot one. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1316.8s)]
*  Um, their bodies are completely different. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1318.8799999999999s)]
*  I think KG was probably a better athlete, but the way, the way, uh, as a [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1321.04s)]
*  help defender and a rim protector and just how he's moving a second before the [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1326.04s)]
*  play is moving and he always seems to know where shit's going. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1330.92s)]
*  That's the KG quality. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1333.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean, that was, that was one of the things that made him so special. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1334.96s)]
*  He doesn't have the same size. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1337.76s)]
*  He doesn't have the same arm length. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1339.0800000000002s)]
*  Um, and he's not as like a scary competitor, but he's fierce like KG was, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1340.72s)]
*  you know, and I think that's another guy who is a good comparison for him, where [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1345.72s)]
*  you, you talk to, like we were doing the Celtic stock and we had so many stories [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1349.28s)]
*  from these people that played on those 08, 09 teams where they were just like, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1353.04s)]
*  the guy was a lunatic. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1357.1200000000001s)]
*  Like we had these random scrimmages and you know, beginning of October, four [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1359.68s)]
*  weeks before the season started and he's caked in sweat and screaming at everybody. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1364.68s)]
*  And there's, there's just certain guys like that. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1368.84s)]
*  That's why the fit's going to be so important. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1371.04s)]
*  Like New Orleans, that one would worry me because of, uh, you know, they've [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1373.72s)]
*  been a tortured franchise for 50 years. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1378.88s)]
*  It just seems like people go there and bad things happen. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1380.92s)]
*  Utah is a weird fit just because of the players they already have. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1383.32s)]
*  Toronto was kind of the other one I was looking at where they have, you know, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1386.6s)]
*  some interesting offensive players and a couple of Barnes. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1391.32s)]
*  I don't know what Barnes is still, but they have some talent and could that be a [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1394.44s)]
*  place where he could go in and he just becomes a centrifugal force. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1399.48s)]
*  How much is, how much is what happens over these next month here, the AC [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1402.84s)]
*  tournament and, uh, and March madness. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1406.44s)]
*  Does it affect anything with him and how people are going to feel about him? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1409.48s)]
*  Um, I don't think so. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1413.48s)]
*  I think I really don't even know what would have to, he'd have to like just [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1414.92s)]
*  totally crap the bed or something. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1418.64s)]
*  I he's he, there are certain prospects that get to the point where it is. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1420.52s)]
*  It is. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1425.88s)]
*  You're just like, you're not having like positive generating, like diminishing [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1427.04s)]
*  returns is the word I'm trying to think of it's watching him at this point is [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1432.52s)]
*  just not, there's not a lot of point to it because I've seen enough. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1436.04s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1439.4s)]
*  You've, you've sent in your verdict already. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1439.88s)]
*  Is he the most short thing guy you've studied since you started doing this with us? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1441.72s)]
*  I think that he is probably the most, you mentioned Katie, Katie's active mind. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1446.88s)]
*  I wasn't scouting back then. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1451.88s)]
*  I was a kid, but I mean, he, he probably has the most driven personality other [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1452.88s)]
*  than I would say Wimby is the only other person that I can think of that when I [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1458.84s)]
*  watched them, I'm just like, there is singular focus in this person and you [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1462.56s)]
*  can tell that they're bright. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1466.76s)]
*  I just think, and this can transition into kind of some of the broader things [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1468.24s)]
*  about the league and the way it's going, I think, but he, he just has this [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1471.88s)]
*  curiosity about him that I would not bet against and, and I don't want to overstate [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1476.08s)]
*  when we talk about his handle and things like that, it's not like he's a [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1480.92s)]
*  Yakety Sax disaster. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1483.64s)]
*  It's just, he has a couple different areas where teams are trying to bait him [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1485.24s)]
*  into going and he's getting smarter and smarter about not taking the bait. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1489.56s)]
*  And, and there are some ways I pointed them out in the article that he can [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1494.32s)]
*  specifically, I think, set his man up to create kind of driving lanes for himself [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1497.36s)]
*  and create more advantageous situations. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1502.1999999999998s)]
*  But you mentioned like which team he goes to. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1504.52s)]
*  I just don't, I wouldn't worry about that. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1507.52s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1509.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1510.28s)]
*  Because you can go so many different directions with him, you know, right. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1510.4799999999998s)]
*  And you could be in the team. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1513.56s)]
*  You have five years from now. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1514.6s)]
*  Maybe nobody's on that team from right now. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1516.4399999999998s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1518.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1518.9599999999998s)]
*  Cause Wemby was a sure thing, except how tall he was and the history of [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1519.1999999999998s)]
*  guys over a certain height. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1524.6399999999999s)]
*  So even though he was a sure thing and he checked every box, he wasn't a [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1526.6s)]
*  sure thing because it's just hard when you get that big and we have the [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1530.0s)]
*  history of the, it's just, it's too complicated. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1534.6799999999998s)]
*  So it's always in the background. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1538.4399999999998s)]
*  Every time he would land on a foot, anything, you're always nervous. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1540.04s)]
*  Um, Luca to me, at least for me was the surest thing. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1543.52s)]
*  Just kept watching what he did that year overseas and how sophisticated [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1547.7199999999998s)]
*  his offensive game was. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1552.3999999999999s)]
*  And I thought Anthony Davis was a sure thing. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1554.28s)]
*  Um, I was super, I was incredibly excited for Zion. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1556.92s)]
*  I thought, you know, holy shit. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1560.48s)]
*  If that, but there was always that fear factor with Zion cause he was so in [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1562.24s)]
*  the air all the time, you know, those guys always make you a little nervous. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1565.48s)]
*  Anthony Davis was like, this guy's definitely going to be on a really good [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1568.44s)]
*  team at some point in his career. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1571.72s)]
*  You just see it at Kentucky. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1573.28s)]
*  Now it took longer than we thought, but those are the guys, at least recently [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1574.76s)]
*  that I think jump out of my missing anyone. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1578.24s)]
*  You're right about Luca. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1580.68s)]
*  I'm trying to think of, I'm sure there are other ones. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1581.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, these are just kind of the high points. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1583.68s)]
*  Um, cause you look at somebody like John Moran, you're like, all right, this [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1585.44s)]
*  is a guy who can't shoot from the outside. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1588.44s)]
*  He's an electric athlete, but you know, he's in the air, he's banging [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1589.8799999999999s)]
*  bodies all the time, there's things that make you nervous. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1593.48s)]
*  If I, if I'm taking a guy like this, I want it to be like, I know I'm going [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1595.72s)]
*  to have this guy for 12 to 15 years at the highest possible level and for [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1599.96s)]
*  something for that not to happen would have to be like a legitimate fluke. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1604.36s)]
*  It's not a legitimate fluke of like Wemba Nyama hurts his knee or his foot [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1609.04s)]
*  or anything because we see that with centers, but you know, I think I, the [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1613.44s)]
*  Anthony Davis to me, it seemed like, man, I really hard to come up with a [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1617.92s)]
*  scenario where he's not awesome. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1621.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1623.04s)]
*  The, the Luca one you pointed out is, is, is a good one too. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1623.6000000000001s)]
*  And I think that one should be in the group too, because, and he has some [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1626.52s)]
*  similarities in terms of the way I just, I always try to watch guys who seek, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1629.04s)]
*  who like run away from stagnation in their, in their sort of development [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1633.88s)]
*  towards the NBA because Luca, every single time and his, you know, the [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1638.08s)]
*  people around him played it really smartly is that when he was at a certain [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1641.6s)]
*  age, the challenge, they were always ahead of the, of the stagnation. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1644.8799999999999s)]
*  They were like, all right, we, we see that he's going to stagnate here. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1648.36s)]
*  And they just kept moving him up. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1650.9199999999998s)]
*  And I think what happens in that situation is you just develop the later you delay [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1652.6s)]
*  problem solving in your development. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1658.28s)]
*  I think the worst off you are because problem solving and decision making are [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1660.12s)]
*  the most important thing to help you adapt to the speed of the NBA. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1664.04s)]
*  And I just, I just think you see some guys like Chris Paul came into the [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1667.76s)]
*  league and his size always was a stimulant, I think for him as a problem [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1670.8s)]
*  solver, whereas you look at somebody like these high school college guards who [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1675.66s)]
*  are big bullies on the playground, who get to the NBA and suddenly they can't [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1680.72s)]
*  bully anymore, you just see them be like, for the first time in their career, like, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1683.72s)]
*  Oh shit, I got to think about this in some way. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1687.3600000000001s)]
*  And you see them kind of get bowled back by it. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1689.8s)]
*  And I just think that Cooper Cooper is so ahead of it on that front. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1691.76s)]
*  Chris Paul was a short thing to me as a point guard. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1695.56s)]
*  I was, that was like, there was no way he wasn't going to be really good. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1698.6s)]
*  And Durant was another one from that era that if you actually watched that whole [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1702.2s)]
*  season and watched all the, just how easy it was to get whatever shot he wanted [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1706.28s)]
*  and how unusual of a player he was, it was like, there was no way this guy is [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1711.16s)]
*  going to be awesome where I usually get in trouble or the, the, the guys who have [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1714.72s)]
*  the athleticism, but it's hard to tell what the motor is or what the [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1719.04s)]
*  competitiveness is or situations like Dwight Howard. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1722.8s)]
*  It's like, how did the guys 18 he's got a Donis body. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1726.2s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1729.9199999999998s)]
*  You know, would you bet your life? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1731.1599999999999s)]
*  LeBron was an easy one. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1732.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1734.1599999999999s)]
*  You know, in 03, all you had to do was watch him in high school twice. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1734.6399999999999s)]
*  And like, there's nothing like this right now. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1737.8799999999999s)]
*  Six foot, eight and a half, like athlete like this, this is going to be insane. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1740.2s)]
*  It's hard to like, not hold it against guys too, because you'll watch players who [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1745.2s)]
*  were 18 years old, like you said, and you're like, how, how competitive is he? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1749.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1753.2s)]
*  You start to feel a little wishy washy about it. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1753.5600000000002s)]
*  And I think to myself, I'm, I'm, I'm just thinking, well, thank goodness. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1756.04s)]
*  No one was judging my career when I was 18 years old, because I was just a total [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1759.16s)]
*  shit hit and had no clue what I was doing. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1763.04s)]
*  You can grow out of it, but there are red flags though, like Ben Simmons, that [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1765.04s)]
*  LSU season and then him just ditching the team with like a few weeks left. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1768.92s)]
*  And it was like, Hmm, that didn't go great. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1773.88s)]
*  You know, like, whereas like, if it was somebody like Cooper flag, or if KG had [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1777.48s)]
*  gone to college, like there's just no way they're not finishing the season and [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1781.0800000000002s)]
*  being a complete psychopath the entire season. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1784.72s)]
*  So there's stuff you can learn. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1786.92s)]
*  I, to me, flag is as sure of a thing as I can remember. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1788.52s)]
*  And the best thing about him from an MBA standpoint, you can just see what he's [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1791.96s)]
*  going to be like, there's such a clear position that now exists in the way, in [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1796.3200000000002s)]
*  the way the league is that I would just assume somebody's going to end up using [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1801.5600000000002s)]
*  him a lot, like the Celtics use Tatum. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1805.96s)]
*  He's going to have the ball a lot. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1807.88s)]
*  He's going to bounce around depending on what the matchup is. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1809.44s)]
*  It can be a little bit of a Swiss army knife the same way Tatum is. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1812.16s)]
*  Um, and can he be a crunch time guy? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1815.3600000000001s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1818.08s)]
*  Is he going to be better off as a completely overqualified number two? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1818.68s)]
*  I think he's better than that, but yeah, that's your worst case scenario for him. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1823.2s)]
*  Um, it's going to be really great. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1827.4s)]
*  All right. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1829.2s)]
*  We're taking a break. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1829.44s)]
*  We got to talk about a lot of MBA stuff here. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1830.1200000000001s)]

*  So I asked you any MBA trends stuff that you've noticed this year. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1942.6000000000001s)]
*  You let, you're a big style of play comparing stuff to history guy. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1945.84s)]
*  As am I, uh, anything you've noticed this year that jumped out, you're like, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1949.3999999999999s)]
*  Hmm, well, this is something. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1953.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1956.52s)]
*  Over the, this all ties together to what we were talking about with Cooper. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1956.8s)]
*  And I think it factors into, um, player types and things like that. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1960.72s)]
*  When you're looking at the way that the two teams that I think before the season, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1965.52s)]
*  your pick for the finals was okay. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1970.36s)]
*  See Boston, right? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1972.04s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1973.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1973.72s)]
*  And if I think if you look at the way, and I think this will tie to Jimmy's [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1974.52s)]
*  fit with Golden state too, which I know you want to talk about this spatial sense [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1978.36s)]
*  and flow, like we know that in the past, really since video and analytics became [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1983.48s)]
*  really, really ubiquitous and easy to access, I think that the league made a [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1989.32s)]
*  leap forward. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1994.16s)]
*  I don't even think that's speculation. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1994.72s)]
*  I think the flow of information just iterated really, really fast. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1996.04s)]
*  Things were more, the scouting reports got more and more complicated from [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=1999.64s)]
*  game to game and more detailed and things like that. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2003.64s)]
*  So you've just kind of seen the flow of information take a leap up. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2006.3200000000002s)]
*  And I think if you look at the way, uh, I know you're keenly aware of this, but [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2011.1200000000001s)]
*  when you just kind of, I noticed this in the finals, whenever the Celtics players, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2014.88s)]
*  I remember I was like watching there, there are a lot of people on Twitter who [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2019.0s)]
*  are, we have people who are the former NBA people, the people who I think are [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2022.68s)]
*  actually qualified to analyze mid series adjustments in detail. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2026.3200000000002s)]
*  There's not a ton of them, but we have some on Twitter and you were watching [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2031.48s)]
*  the details and you would go down through there and they'd say, okay, there's [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2034.8s)]
*  this, this, this, this, and this rule for this, this, this defensive coverage. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2038.32s)]
*  And I'm just looking at it and you just, your head starts spinning and you just [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2043.04s)]
*  think how in the world could someone on the court keep all that information in [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2046.4s)]
*  their head to the point where it's like reactionary. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2050.88s)]
*  And I think that that is something that is setting OKC in Boston aside from just [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2053.68s)]
*  having, being smart transactionally, something that is setting those two [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2059.24s)]
*  programs apart is I think that they are curating people just better than anybody [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2063.2799999999997s)]
*  else. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2067.72s)]
*  I think you're getting good basketball players, but if you look at the types of [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2068.04s)]
*  guys and you're like, why is Peyton Pritchard popping? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2071.04s)]
*  Why is Sam Howser popping? [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2073.24s)]
*  Why is, why are these guys working? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2074.64s)]
*  What is, what is it about Al Horford that's allowing him to, you know, um, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2077.24s)]
*  why is it that Derek White is, is, has found a home there? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2081.52s)]
*  I just think that overall, if you look at organizations and how they are like [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2084.56s)]
*  evaluating people, I think that that is a huge advantage in the NBA today, just [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2089.7599999999998s)]
*  because of what we were talking about in terms of the speed of the game. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2094.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2098.68s)]
*  The discipline of we know what types of players we want to put together and we're [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2099.16s)]
*  never deviating from this, right? [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2103.32s)]
*  The Celtics had this last year with, uh, Brissette. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2105.88s)]
*  They really liked Brissette, incredibly popular teammate, um, good athlete. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2109.64s)]
*  Um, you know, whether he's an NBA rotation guy, I don't know, but they [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2114.4s)]
*  ended the year and they're like, we're just, we're not playing anybody who can't [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2118.56s)]
*  make a wide open three if the ball goes to them, right? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2121.44s)]
*  So then they're testing out got different guys this year and it's Jordan [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2123.52s)]
*  Walsh gets a cup of coffee and they started playing my guy, Jayden Springer. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2127.0s)]
*  And I, they just came to the decision. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2130.92s)]
*  Like everybody in the, everybody in Florida needs to be able to shoot a three. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2133.6s)]
*  That's what we're riding with. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2138.32s)]
*  So then they ended up with Torrey Craig. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2139.36s)]
*  Um, and then smart guys who all of them can guard somebody or at least not get [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2141.4s)]
*  completely embarrassed in space. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2145.48s)]
*  None of them need the ball, need to be like ball stoppers because they already [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2147.6800000000003s)]
*  have two semi ball stoppers with Tatum and Brown. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2151.16s)]
*  Um, you could sustain like one or two of those guys, right? [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2154.04s)]
*  You can have one, two, and even those guys are trying to get better at it. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2156.96s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2161.52s)]
*  And then, okay. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2162.12s)]
*  See, it's pretty clear what they're trying to, they're just getting fantastic [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2162.7200000000003s)]
*  athletes. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2166.52s)]
*  Um, they want the ability to go bigger or smaller depending on who they're playing. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2167.32s)]
*  And they want guys who can fit with, with shake is as great as she is. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2171.96s)]
*  He's another one who is, I don't, I don't think he's the easiest guy to play with. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2176.4s)]
*  Sometimes is the ball a lot, especially when he's feeling it and you gotta have [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2179.28s)]
*  guys who aren't going to be like, all right, now it's my turn to shoot. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2182.76s)]
*  They don't have any, it's my turn now. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2185.08s)]
*  They don't have any of those guys, right? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2186.8s)]
*  And she's themed. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2188.56s)]
*  They all know it. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2189.28s)]
*  And Chet is such, she's another one who's just so additive. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2189.88s)]
*  Like, like going back to the Cooper discussion from [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2193.56s)]
*  I think she had Cooper have a lot in common. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2195.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2197.3599999999997s)]
*  Actually. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2197.56s)]
*  He's just like, he's just there to help and ship in and, uh, he takes nothing off [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2197.8799999999997s)]
*  the table and then Jaylen Williams is now their wild card and that's the guy. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2201.7999999999997s)]
*  I think when they get to the playoffs, that's he's going to decide serious for [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2206.3199999999997s)]
*  them because you're not going to take out Jay, but you can limit him a little bit. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2209.8399999999997s)]
*  You can make it hard for him. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2215.7999999999997s)]
*  You can send doubles at them. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2216.8399999999997s)]
*  You can do all the stuff that teams are trying to do to take them over the last [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2217.9599999999996s)]
*  couple of years, and eventually you're going to need the Jaylen Brown guy to [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2220.8399999999997s)]
*  step up and make some plays and you're going to need the side guys. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2224.2400000000002s)]
*  That's when I, especially, I don't know if you saw their, uh, them fall apart [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2227.28s)]
*  against Minnesota in that second game and down the stretch and OT, but I still [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2232.28s)]
*  feel like, you know, until you've done there and you have the scars and you've [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2238.08s)]
*  lost a couple of those and you have these guys who've just, they've kind of [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2243.36s)]
*  been through a few of those, like I still never going to a hundred percent trust it. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2246.6s)]
*  But then you'll have a situation with the 2000 victim warriors where it's like, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2250.1600000000003s)]
*  I don't trust it. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2253.2000000000003s)]
*  And then they're hoisted the trophy, you know, but anyway, back to your original [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2254.04s)]
*  point, I think you're right. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2258.6800000000003s)]
*  Those two teams that I think Cleveland, I think deserves credit for [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2260.4s)]
*  understanding who they are. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2263.8s)]
*  And even that Hunter trade I thought was such a good trade. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2265.32s)]
*  They needed this specific thing. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2268.8s)]
*  They went out and got it. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2270.36s)]
*  All of their guys compliment each other. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2271.32s)]
*  And, uh, to me, those are the three. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2273.56s)]
*  I, those are the three with, uh, Denver is the wild card for the top four. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2275.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2280.04s)]
*  Sometimes you get lucky and a superstar, like a Yoke itch, you just sit him in the [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2280.3199999999997s)]
*  middle of your, you know, your planetary diorama and everything falls into place [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2284.0s)]
*  around him and Yoke and Yoke itch takes spare parts and, you know, this, you know, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2287.8799999999997s)]
*  if you handed a professional drummer, a really crappy drum kid, he knows how to [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2292.44s)]
*  make it sound good. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2296.2s)]
*  And I feel like that's, that's kind of Yoke itch. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2296.92s)]
*  Yoke itch can repurpose things that maybe one man's trash is another man's treasure. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2298.7999999999997s)]
*  But I think with these teams, these two teams specifically, you know, when you [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2302.7999999999997s)]
*  think about the slugging percentage of how many decisions there are within a [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2307.32s)]
*  given NBA game, and you think about the difference, the margins between a small [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2311.52s)]
*  decision and I think like attacking and vacating space is an enormous thing that [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2316.8s)]
*  can tank whether or not a team is working like with, with the Celtics or [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2322.28s)]
*  with, with OKC, if a guy doesn't have an instinctual kind of feel for, all right, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2326.4s)]
*  they're loading up on Shay in this situation, ex-player's head is turned. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2332.28s)]
*  You know, I'm going to go here and that takes an activeness of mind, I think that. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2336.84s)]
*  But then the other thing is just how, and the vacating space is the other thing, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2341.04s)]
*  and just getting the fuck out of the way, as we've seen is, you know, knowing [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2344.96s)]
*  when to do that, but I think in terms of guys getting better too, I think it's [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2347.76s)]
*  gotten super detailed down to the point of they know what it takes for a person [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2352.6000000000004s)]
*  to like have like a permanence of a concept and they know how to sort of do [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2358.6400000000003s)]
*  that whenever they're working guys out. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2364.76s)]
*  And guys who aren't reflective people, you're talking about like knowing who [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2366.36s)]
*  you are, they're just not going to be as apt to grow as fast as other players. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2369.6800000000003s)]
*  So I think it's gotten really like psychologically detailed even in that [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2373.92s)]
*  point and, and I think you're absolutely right about it, it does kind of come [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2377.44s)]
*  down to knowing who you are. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2381.04s)]
*  Like it's amazing how many teams across the league don't really know who they are. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2383.56s)]
*  I made a joke last year about the Bulls. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2388.0s)]
*  I was like, the Bulls were like Bruce Willison, the Sixth Sense, they were [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2390.0800000000004s)]
*  dead and they had no idea. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2393.44s)]
*  And you'll look at some teams, some teams who just are, are just sunk cause [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2394.7999999999997s)]
*  following these paths that are never going to end up being a masterpiece. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2399.56s)]
*  And I think that's a really key part of it. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2402.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2405.4399999999996s)]
*  Golden State is a good example of knowing who you are because the Brandon Ingram [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2405.68s)]
*  trade was sitting there for them for whatever season. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2409.8799999999997s)]
*  And they're like, this is the kind of guy that doesn't work out for us. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2413.8399999999997s)]
*  You know, he needs a ball. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2416.52s)]
*  He's a little bit of a ball stopper. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2417.72s)]
*  Um, him playing without the ball. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2419.7599999999998s)]
*  Is it awesome? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2421.64s)]
*  Kerr had him and team USA didn't work out great. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2422.32s)]
*  He basically, uh, didn't even, I don't even think he played the last two games, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2424.76s)]
*  but, uh, they kind of held the fort and then they, you know, which ties into, we [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2428.7200000000003s)]
*  want to talk about Jimmy bringing in Jimmy and you keeping your fingers [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2432.4s)]
*  crossed that he's going to behave himself. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2435.92s)]
*  But knowing that there's a hoops IQ element with him, but then now there's [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2438.1600000000003s)]
*  this whole low post and space and Steph pulling guys away and basically you're [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2442.32s)]
*  able to play four on three a little bit with Jimmy as your low post guys. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2448.7200000000003s)]
*  Weird as that is. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2453.0400000000004s)]
*  They've never really had a low post guy like that since I don't know. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2453.88s)]
*  I, Durant, if you count him as a, but he's kind of like a medium post guy. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2457.8s)]
*  David, David Lee going way back. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2462.7200000000003s)]
*  I guess you could throw him a ball. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2464.7200000000003s)]
*  Little bogey maybe there's a tiny bit of bogey, a tiny bit of David West, but [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2466.6400000000003s)]
*  Butler, uh, it's been, and we're taping this before they played in it, but it's [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2471.1600000000003s)]
*  been really fun to watch the different spaces they have now and Steph stats have [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2474.96s)]
*  immediately got better. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2478.96s)]
*  I mean, he's, he's just, it's already had an effect on him and the more I love the [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2479.96s)]
*  trade when it happened, we were really bullish on it. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2484.56s)]
*  Um, I bet on the warriors when I was at the Superbowl to make the playoffs and [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2486.96s)]
*  fandel, um, the more I'm staring at it, like I do, there are some Rashid Wallace [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2490.96s)]
*  Oh four parallels where, um, you know, both of those guys, neither of them had [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2495.76s)]
*  actually won a title, but gotten really close. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2502.16s)]
*  Both of them were just unbelievably talented. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2504.7599999999998s)]
*  Both of them wore out their welcome at the road place and both of them were. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2507.52s)]
*  A non sexy asset because of what had happened, but they were still assets. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2514.16s)]
*  And then it's like, what if we can take this and move this here into this [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2519.0s)]
*  culture with these people? [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2522.7599999999998s)]
*  What does this look like? [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2524.72s)]
*  It's very hard to pull those trades off. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2526.12s)]
*  We've seen a lot of people try to pull off the 2004 Rashid trade. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2527.92s)]
*  They might've done it. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2532.12s)]
*  This might, this is a team that had no championship ceiling at all. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2533.64s)]
*  And now they're a team that we have to at least mention. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2537.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2539.96s)]
*  There's a sweet spot of distressed asset and talent that is, that is act, that [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2540.16s)]
*  you could bet on in the right scenario. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2545.7999999999997s)]
*  And you have, you also just have to have the culture to sustain something like [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2548.16s)]
*  that and the warriors have proven over and over again that they can, um, but I [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2551.6s)]
*  think the big thing I was looking at some of the stats through, I guess it was [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2556.3199999999997s)]
*  seven games. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2559.72s)]
*  I mean, there, there are seven, three main lineups that Jimmy is a part of that [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2560.68s)]
*  have a plus 20 net rating and only one of them is like actually negative. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2564.9599999999996s)]
*  He's in one lineup that's like negative 0.5 or something. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2568.68s)]
*  So his impact on it has been immediate. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2572.04s)]
*  And I think you hit it where talking about like Duran in the post, I think the [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2574.04s)]
*  big thing is that Steph has not had like a switch partner for a while. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2577.68s)]
*  Like he hasn't had a guy on the floor where if you switch this, this is going to [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2582.9599999999996s)]
*  create an issue because you think about, you know, Wiggins had his little run [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2587.4s)]
*  there where he was doing some things and they've had these, they've had, you [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2590.4s)]
*  know, they've had scores here and there like pool, they could put him in an [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2594.0s)]
*  action for that season and he was, he was making, making lemonade. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2597.48s)]
*  But I think that he has, that is like the starting point really since like [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2600.84s)]
*  Iguodala or Durant, I don't think that they've had a guy that could punish a [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2605.48s)]
*  switch as consistently as Jimmy does. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2608.84s)]
*  Iguodala is a good, good one for that. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2612.12s)]
*  Cause there's some of the defense that he brought to the table is, is some of [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2614.04s)]
*  the stuff Butler's doing for them too. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2617.4s)]
*  I'm really intrigued by them. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2619.52s)]
*  I, and Lakers are another one. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2620.64s)]
*  I think he's going to fit in easier with gold state than this Lakers situation. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2622.48s)]
*  I'm, I'm, you know, I've, I've already gone on the record. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2629.2799999999997s)]
*  I think to me, they're a legitimate contender, but it's a pretty [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2632.08s)]
*  dramatic trade for mid season. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2636.7599999999998s)]
*  The history of the league is it's really hard to make a trade like that. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2638.52s)]
*  Halfway through the year and then actually have it lead to you [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2644.04s)]
*  making the finals or better. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2646.7599999999998s)]
*  There's some examples, but not somebody as talented as, as Lucas. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2648.4s)]
*  And you know, it's, it's just, the league is so much more fun than it was a month [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2652.8s)]
*  ago, because golden state was not fun to watch. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2657.4s)]
*  I hated watching the Lakers. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2660.08s)]
*  And now you have these two that it just feels like we have enough teams. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2662.36s)]
*  I think Memphis is really interesting because, you know, Ja, Ja will have these [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2665.64s)]
*  games where he's like nine for 25, but he makes the two biggest shots of the game. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2671.2799999999997s)]
*  He's not making threes at all. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2675.4799999999996s)]
*  Um, he still plays the same kind of reckless offensive game [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2677.4799999999996s)]
*  that always works out for him. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2680.8799999999997s)]
*  He hasn't really evolved from that at all, but he's still like, they're [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2682.12s)]
*  down six down a point or down one with six seconds left. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2685.9199999999996s)]
*  I just feel like he's scoring. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2691.6s)]
*  He's one of those guys, you know, like in a playoff series, I'm not positive. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2693.0s)]
*  I'd want to see them. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2696.12s)]
*  And I also don't think they could win the title. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2696.8799999999997s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2698.8399999999997s)]
*  I think the league got really interesting. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2699.24s)]
*  And I was not interested a month ago. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2701.16s)]
*  How about you? [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2702.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2703.48s)]
*  Well, I was going to say a couple of things that the, the Luca trade, I would, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2704.3999999999996s)]
*  I guess I haven't even gotten to talk to you about it at all, but I was at the [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2708.72s)]
*  Calipari return game, which I thought was going to be the biggest story that night. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2711.44s)]
*  And we were sitting there in the post game presser and somebody showed me their [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2715.8399999999997s)]
*  phone. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2718.72s)]
*  I was, I was like, well, what? [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2719.12s)]
*  Like, I didn't believe it seriously for like the rest of the night anyway. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2720.3999999999996s)]
*  Everybody's beaten that one to death, but, um, on Ja he's, he definitely is the [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2724.16s)]
*  separator for them in that sense. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2729.0s)]
*  I do think that he's suffered a little bit from defensive, like officiating [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2731.44s)]
*  shifting recently, like the way that they, and that speaks into what's, I think [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2736.56s)]
*  that's what has made Boston and okay. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2740.96s)]
*  See really effective too, is the fact that they have that they just have this chain, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2743.04s)]
*  these, this circular chain link that really doesn't have any obvious gap in it. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2747.56s)]
*  Because even if you are bigger than them, they're so laterally mobile and strong [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2751.92s)]
*  that they can prevent players from playing as big as they are because they [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2757.52s)]
*  move so well, you know, because, you know, a job, a lob threat, one of the ways to [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2761.2000000000003s)]
*  stop a lob threat is to physically get in front of them, like don't let them [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2765.88s)]
*  jump, you know? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2769.84s)]
*  Um, and I think that, uh, that's another big thing that has really made an [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2770.84s)]
*  impression on me in terms of how to view the league is a, I think strength is, we [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2775.92s)]
*  had that time where the game spread way out and, you know, offensive players [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2781.5600000000004s)]
*  ruled the day and I think getting, being skinny was something you could get away [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2785.52s)]
*  with, but I think the more that they've allowed defenses to sort of exist, the [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2788.88s)]
*  more I think players like the Celtics have like your drew holidays, your lower [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2793.04s)]
*  sort of secondary body kind of guys, I think are having an impact again. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2797.84s)]
*  It's fun to think of teams even five, 10 years ago and how they would have [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2802.48s)]
*  competed in the league now, the way, how deep everything is. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2806.44s)]
*  Cause I do think the league is just better. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2810.16s)]
*  And I think that the teams are deeper in a way that that whole model of the mid [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2812.0s)]
*  late 2000s, I'm not sure like the 2017 words would still be awesome, but you go [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2816.64s)]
*  to like that 2019 Raptors team that won. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2821.6s)]
*  And I know Kawhi was awesome, but he wasn't as awesome in the last two rounds [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2824.88s)]
*  is I think when we think about, when we think like, oh my God, playoff Kawhi in [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2828.68s)]
*  2019, it was like, all right, the last two rounds, not quite as good. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2833.16s)]
*  They got a really good Van Vliet one series and you know, they patched it [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2836.16s)]
*  together. They had some really good competitors, but I look at that team [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2841.0s)]
*  now and it's like, would that team, would you pick that team ahead of Boston or [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2843.56s)]
*  Cleveland in a playoff series from what we have this year? [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2847.6s)]
*  I wouldn't with Gasol and Kawhi and Siakam. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2850.04s)]
*  I think Ananobe missed the playoffs, Van Vliet, Lowry. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2854.6s)]
*  I just, I think that's, that's the third best team in the East. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2858.48s)]
*  So you go back and you look at some of these, like that Bucs team that won in [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2862.32s)]
*  21, I don't think that team could win now. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2865.84s)]
*  I think that Phoenix team that made the finals built around Booker and CP3 and [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2870.48s)]
*  Deandre Ayton and Bridges and Cam Johnson. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2875.6s)]
*  Like that team's not making the finals now. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2877.92s)]
*  There's no way that league's just better. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2879.8s)]
*  Wasn't the West pretty devastated that year too? [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2881.92s)]
*  I mean, not to... [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2884.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, there was some bad luck. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2885.04s)]
*  Yeah, it all blurs together, but yeah, the, yeah, I'm trying to think back. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2885.92s)]
*  There was a, the Murray injury was a big one that year. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2889.92s)]
*  Well, the league's, the league sort of ebbed and flow between the Helio thing [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2892.4s)]
*  spiked to the moon, obviously for a while there. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2896.12s)]
*  And we've talked about this a lot where I think that we've kind of shifted away [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2898.44s)]
*  from that model, I don't think works as well anymore, I think. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2902.08s)]
*  And you see, you've seen the shift with the way Cleveland is playing this year. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2906.04s)]
*  They went from ball, they are a really good example of a team that was maybe [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2909.36s)]
*  probably miscalibrated a little bit in the way that they were so ball screen [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2912.96s)]
*  dominant with Donovan Mitchell. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2916.76s)]
*  And I would look at that team over the past couple of years and just be like, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2918.16s)]
*  if they would just play through their big, now Evan Mobley had to get better. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2921.08s)]
*  I think that's a key part of the equation, but you know, allowing those guys to move [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2924.48s)]
*  around him, I think they're a good example of the way the league has shifted lately. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2927.84s)]
*  When you look at the way they've succeeded. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2931.32s)]
*  I think people think I'm doing a bit and trying to reverse Jinx Cleveland. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2933.6400000000003s)]
*  When I talk about how good I think they are, I think that team's really good. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2937.4s)]
*  I think it's gonna be really hard to win a seven game series against them, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2941.56s)]
*  especially when they have a game seven and the biggest thing that's changed. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2945.56s)]
*  Everyone's talked about the, how Mitchell, when they gave him the contract and he's [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2950.44s)]
*  just pulled back enough that still his team, but other guys get to shine. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2954.04s)]
*  Garland's healthy, but Mobley is the big difference. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2958.8s)]
*  Cause I feel like his three is going in now. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2961.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, last year it was like, please shoot that. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2964.7599999999998s)]
*  You're not making that. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2967.04s)]
*  You there's no way it's going to be ugly line drive. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2967.92s)]
*  Now he's shooting with confidence. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2970.24s)]
*  And it's a team that has four of the best 50 guys in the league. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2971.8s)]
*  Mitchell's in the top eight. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2978.92s)]
*  Mobley's probably in the top 20 to 22 at this point. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2980.88s)]
*  And then Hunter is a fifth guy is nuts. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2984.72s)]
*  And I got to be honest, like everyone's already given the six man award to a [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2987.4s)]
*  patent to Peyton Pritchard who's who's it's weird. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2991.96s)]
*  You have to watch him. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2996.04s)]
*  Cause his stats are better than Ty Jerome. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2996.84s)]
*  And part of the reason they're better is cause he's had games where he played in [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=2998.92s)]
*  place of white or no Jaylen Brown and they just let him go off and I'll have like 29. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3001.88s)]
*  So maybe that's why he should win. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3006.24s)]
*  I think Ty Jerome's been the best bench guy in the league. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3008.12s)]
*  I, especially in these big games, he he's like swinging games. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3011.52s)]
*  Pritchard will have games against certain teams when he just looks like a, like an [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3015.2799999999997s)]
*  undersized guard who can't do anything and teams are attacking him. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3019.72s)]
*  Ty Jerome looks like it's like, is this guy a $100 billion player? [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3023.64s)]
*  What is he? [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3026.88s)]
*  So I, I just don't think that six made of the year is over yet. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3028.0s)]
*  Cause I think he's been playing great. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3030.92s)]
*  Has anybody ever won most improved and six million of the year in the same year? [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3032.7999999999997s)]
*  Cause the double, the double dip. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3036.88s)]
*  Would he have a, would he have, [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3039.12s)]
*  how much of an argument would he have for that? [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3040.4s)]
*  Do you think? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3041.92s)]
*  Cause is it just, did he, is it, did he improve or is it that he got into a [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3042.36s)]
*  context where he's properly seen? [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3047.2400000000002s)]
*  Cause I think he's improved. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3049.1600000000003s)]
*  He's obviously worked at his game. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3050.44s)]
*  It, I don't, I don't think that's ever happened. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3051.96s)]
*  Has it? [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3053.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm trying to think of the double dipping on the major awards. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3054.36s)]
*  We've had, we had a rookie of the year MVP before, right? [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3057.0s)]
*  Didn't, will, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3060.2000000000003s)]
*  Cade's the favorite on Fandle. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3062.32s)]
*  And I think that's justified for most improved. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3063.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3066.2400000000002s)]
*  The leap that he made now that this is like usually most improved is either one [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3066.48s)]
*  of two things. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3071.16s)]
*  It's either I was here and now I'm here or it's like, nobody was even fucking [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3071.76s)]
*  talking about me last year. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3076.12s)]
*  Now I'm here. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3077.2s)]
*  Cade becoming a top 10, top 12 guy in the league, which I think he is. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3078.8s)]
*  You saw it last, you know, you've seen it during this win streak. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3084.64s)]
*  You saw it last night. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3086.88s)]
*  Like that's probably the winner, but yeah, Peyton Pritchard is my, is he's plus one [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3087.72s)]
*  seven Oh Beasley. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3093.48s)]
*  I forgot about him. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3094.48s)]
*  He's three to one. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3095.28s)]
*  And like Ty Jerome, Ty Jerome's 50 to one on Fandle. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3096.88s)]
*  I'm like, is there a better sub than him? [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3100.16s)]
*  I guess they have Amann Thompson as a, as a, as a six man candidate. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3102.8s)]
*  That's a weird one. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3108.84s)]
*  I feel like he's a starter, but what do I know? [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3109.6s)]
*  Beasley's been, I guess Beasley is a good choice too. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3111.8s)]
*  My point is I don't think Pritchard has that award locked up by any means. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3115.16s)]
*  Beasley's been amazing for Detroit. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3118.12s)]
*  He's, if he'd played like this on Milwaukee last year, they might've been able to [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3119.92s)]
*  survive until Giannis came back. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3123.2s)]
*  Um, yeah, they, the defensive player of the year, Moby is the favorite for that one too, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3125.2799999999997s)]
*  which, you know, some of this stuff's going to play out and then rookie of the year. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3129.68s)]
*  Um, which is just grisly right now. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3133.56s)]
*  Castle is the favorite, but this is among the worst rookie of the year candidacy [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3137.12s)]
*  classes. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3141.16s)]
*  Are we in Michael Carter Williams territory? [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3142.0s)]
*  Where, uh, we might be. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3144.0s)]
*  Well, that was tough cause he just had fake stats on a team that stunk. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3145.48s)]
*  Um, but yet I still like this rookie class. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3149.7599999999998s)]
*  Where, where do you stand on it? [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3152.12s)]
*  You obviously did a lot of work on it last year for us. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3153.28s)]
*  The, you happy, unhappy, medium, unclear. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3155.52s)]
*  Where are you? [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3158.2400000000002s)]
*  Uh, I think it's spun forward in the way that we thought it would. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3159.7200000000003s)]
*  It was a class. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3163.0800000000004s)]
*  It was a draft class, a high school. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3163.6800000000003s)]
*  It always is driven by the high school class. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3165.48s)]
*  Cause we, they, if they could draft them, they would, but they want to use the [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3167.2000000000003s)]
*  college buffer to get a good kick, the tires and see what happens when they go [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3170.4s)]
*  up at level up in the competition. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3174.1600000000003s)]
*  You saw some shift, you know, I mentioned like Isaiah Collier was a guy who was [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3175.84s)]
*  ranked really high in the class. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3179.0800000000004s)]
*  Somebody, you know, out, out in LA that I assume you got to see some. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3180.64s)]
*  And sometimes you see shifts there that happened, like Reed Sheppard obviously [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3184.2000000000003s)]
*  ascended in that year and got drafted. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3187.64s)]
*  But overall we knew that that class lacked like a generational foundational [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3189.56s)]
*  type of superstar. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3195.0s)]
*  So I, I'm not super surprised that I expected that to spin forward into [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3196.12s)]
*  summer league, which it did. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3200.6s)]
*  Summer league was just like, no, we, you know, there's some guys here that we like. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3201.84s)]
*  Uh, but, and so no overall, not terribly surprised. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3205.2000000000003s)]
*  Are you surprised by Sheppard though? [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3209.0s)]
*  Cause you were pretty, you're pretty high on him, at least being like a bench [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3210.4s)]
*  guy right away, right? [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3215.04s)]
*  I'm kind of amazed. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3216.2s)]
*  He's not playing it off for Houston. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3217.2s)]
*  I don't really know the reasons. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3218.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3220.32s)]
*  You can make the argument. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3220.68s)]
*  You'll hear people talk about, you know, how much time do they have? [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3221.84s)]
*  EMA obviously it's, it's a high bar for a rookie to play for EMA. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3225.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3228.84s)]
*  And just, he wants to, he wants to win. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3229.12s)]
*  That's his mentality. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3231.16s)]
*  And you look at them and what their goals are in the short term, Reed just [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3232.12s)]
*  doesn't really fit them right now. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3236.2400000000002s)]
*  I think the big thing is he really needs to play. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3237.6s)]
*  I was surprised they brought him out of the G league so fast. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3240.24s)]
*  I've heard some people kind of talk about the quality of the G [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3243.96s)]
*  league right now, which is a riveting conversation, but, um, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3246.48s)]
*  Quality being bad. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3249.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3251.68s)]
*  That it's down right now. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3252.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3253.7999999999997s)]
*  It seems like it's the worst it's been. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3254.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3256.12s)]
*  It's I've been shocked by the shooting. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3256.52s)]
*  I mean, I didn't expect him to shoot so poorly, but, um, I don't know. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3258.7599999999998s)]
*  You would think that if he was doing the things that he does well, that he would [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3262.8399999999997s)]
*  get to play because you keep hearing people make that argument about, uh, yeah. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3266.24s)]
*  That, but Dillingham too, I thought we'd come on a little earlier, but I think [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3269.72s)]
*  we've seen some signs that he's going to be okay. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3272.68s)]
*  Some signs the other night. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3274.68s)]
*  I'm all, I'm all in. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3275.7999999999997s)]
*  I haven't sold any of my Dillingham stack. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3276.72s)]
*  I like that. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3279.4799999999996s)]
*  He's a, he seems like a great teammate and a real competitor too, which I like. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3279.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3283.8399999999997s)]
*  You know what? [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3284.24s)]
*  You know what I realized after, after we had finished the draft work last year, I [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3284.7599999999998s)]
*  was like Nick van Exel, I kept saying he, he just, I said he was in the Nick van [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3288.24s)]
*  Exel spiritual lineage. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3293.92s)]
*  And I was like, that's perfect. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3295.4s)]
*  He's the guy you maybe don't lean on him heavily because you could fall down and [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3296.48s)]
*  kill yourself, but you don't hear in there and spurts he comes in and he's obviously [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3300.04s)]
*  really talented him and aunt. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3304.6s)]
*  I don't know if he's going to solve Minnesota's problems or anything like that, [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3306.04s)]
*  but I still believe in, in Rob. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3308.76s)]
*  Who's your favorite non-Cooper flag college guy right now? [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3310.88s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3314.56s)]
*  Let me, uh, pull up my list here. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3315.28s)]
*  Uh, I mean of the, let's see if the guys at the top. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3318.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm fascinated by the other Rutgers guy. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3324.12s)]
*  And I know he's either going to break hearts. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3326.84s)]
*  Ace. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3329.16s)]
*  I'm fascinated by ACE. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3330.44s)]
*  I don't know what he is. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3332.52s)]
*  I know if I was a GM, I think I'd be afraid to be like, all right, this is my third [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3334.44s)]
*  pick, I'm going all in on this guy because there's a chance it just is not going to [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3339.2000000000003s)]
*  translate to the NBA in the right way, but there's another alternate universe where [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3344.32s)]
*  it's like, this guy seems legitimately unstoppable. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3347.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3351.28s)]
*  And what, what is this going to look like if he just figures out a couple of things? [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3351.68s)]
*  I think his offensive, the shot making is just really unusual. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3355.44s)]
*  I, I don't want to compare it to Durant because I, I that's, that's like, you [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3360.72s)]
*  know, sainted ground, but there's some stuff he does where I just don't, I don't [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3365.72s)]
*  think he'd be fun to play with, at least not yet. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3372.24s)]
*  You know, it just seems like the ball's going to him. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3374.8399999999997s)]
*  He's shooting. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3376.64s)]
*  He's one of those guys, but there's some shot making stuff with him. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3377.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3381.0s)]
*  The Durant with Durant, the thing that always kills me is with people, when [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3381.9199999999996s)]
*  they talk about him, the dribble shooting is the thing that set him apart at his [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3385.9199999999996s)]
*  size, you know, and the difference is you just don't, you just don't see guys that [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3389.6s)]
*  can handle and shoot it like that. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3393.7599999999998s)]
*  But then, you know, later down the road, we saw Michael Porter Jr. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3395.9599999999996s)]
*  come along who obviously had a lot of, I think he's more like MPJ personally, [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3398.9599999999996s)]
*  because MPJ at the same age was very similar in that he had this gigantic [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3402.64s)]
*  mallet that was very useful in every single situation and for MPJ, it's [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3408.12s)]
*  continued to be useful, but every single situation was a nail for him because he [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3412.04s)]
*  had this thing that he could just rise up over people and hit shots and ACE has [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3415.68s)]
*  that. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3419.7599999999998s)]
*  Now I have some, my comp that I've made is that I think that, I think that ACE is [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3420.0s)]
*  sort of like, he could be a Jay McDaniels type with the MPJ shot making. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3424.4s)]
*  Like, I think he's, he could be that good defensively? [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3430.52s)]
*  He, I mean, he's a weak side disruptor and I think that the defense could come a [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3433.08s)]
*  long way. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3437.36s)]
*  I think that he's still kind of learning the game. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3437.88s)]
*  Like you talk about problem solving in the way we were earlier. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3440.28s)]
*  I think he's on a new frontier. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3443.0s)]
*  So it's going to be really interesting. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3444.44s)]
*  I would not lean on him to be a decision maker for me, like going to the basket, [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3445.88s)]
*  things like that. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3450.44s)]
*  There's not much proof that he's going to be somebody that can pass out of a [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3451.0s)]
*  situation where he gets loaded up against, but you're right. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3454.4s)]
*  His shot making is crazy. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3456.56s)]
*  He's an extension pink slip guy. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3458.1200000000003s)]
*  You take him and you're either, it's going to work out and you're getting a four [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3462.0s)]
*  year extension or you're, you're going to be on NBA TV in a year. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3465.04s)]
*  It is a risk reward pick, but I am fascinated by him and his teammates really [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3470.08s)]
*  good too. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3475.48s)]
*  I mean, his, his teammate is a way more traditional. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3475.84s)]
*  This is the kind of guy we've seen succeed in the NBA over and over again. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3478.12s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3481.16s)]
*  I don't have a lot of takes on, on him. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3481.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3484.12s)]
*  He fits more. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3484.72s)]
*  What we were talking about before that body, that sturdy lower body type. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3485.36s)]
*  He's, he's a big guard. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3488.6s)]
*  He's a great finisher in the lane. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3489.88s)]
*  He's really crappy. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3491.6s)]
*  It's, it's, he, he, he's going to be a really good NBA player. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3492.6s)]
*  I don't know if he's going to be an all NBA guy, but he'll be good. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3496.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3498.6s)]
*  There's one guy that I would be fascinated for you to watch just because I [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3498.84s)]
*  want to hear your opinion on it because he has a lot of the traits you like. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3502.2000000000003s)]
*  Foreign guy. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3505.44s)]
*  Well, Yegor Dement earlier in the year, I texted you, I was like, you gotta [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3506.6s)]
*  watch this guy run ball screens. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3509.7200000000003s)]
*  He's still fun to watch, but he slipped a little bit because of some of his [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3511.0s)]
*  scoring issues, but the other guy that I would say is Derek Queen from Maryland. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3514.92s)]
*  I think you should watch because he is a very, very slick as crazy [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3520.0s)]
*  hand, eye coordination for his size. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3525.68s)]
*  He's a really smart, like handsy defender. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3527.88s)]
*  He can pass the ball, but he has this kind of slow mo. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3530.84s)]
*  I said he, he, he has some sort of, uh, this is a dangerous one. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3535.76s)]
*  I hesitate to say this, but he has some kind of DL kind of qualities to him. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3540.8s)]
*  Uh, where, where he's a little, he's a little Laze fair and that [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3544.84s)]
*  every once in a while he'll, he's six 10. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3549.2s)]
*  He'll just drive baseline and rifle a left-handed pass through a tight [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3551.4399999999996s)]
*  window to somebody on the money. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3555.24s)]
*  And, um, he's, he's somebody really fascinating that I'm curious to hear [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3556.9199999999996s)]
*  your take on when you get to watch him. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3561.08s)]
*  I've, I gotta say, I've been impressed by Duke, just the team, the team that they [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3563.12s)]
*  have, like I, they have a bunch of guys that I could just see on NBA teams. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3567.3999999999996s)]
*  Down the stretch, but I admittedly have not watched. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3572.04s)]
*  I mean, one of the wrinkles for me is I've never watched women's college basketball [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3574.04s)]
*  during the regular season before. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3578.4s)]
*  And I've actually watched some women. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3579.84s)]
*  I've watched women's college over men's college a couple of times, which has [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3581.4s)]
*  been really surprising to me. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3584.6s)]
*  But so I feel like I'm not as versed on the men as I usually would be at this time [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3585.8s)]
*  of year, but I have watched a bunch of Duke and, um, for them to not at least [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3590.08s)]
*  make like the final four final two, I just feel like something really bad would [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3595.88s)]
*  have happened during a game. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3600.84s)]
*  Like they just go ice cold. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3602.28s)]
*  They just seem really complete. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3603.6800000000003s)]
*  They have a guy on their team that I think you would like named Sion James, who [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3605.12s)]
*  has built like Drew, he's, he's a big, like, uh, and when they moved him into [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3608.72s)]
*  the starting lineup, uh, they played Auburn who has been sort of the favorite [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3613.6s)]
*  for the year, they played Auburn at home and they moved him into the starting [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3617.08s)]
*  lineup and their season just changed. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3620.04s)]
*  He's, he just, he's, he's a smart player. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3622.52s)]
*  He can guard multiple positions. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3624.64s)]
*  Um, so he's somebody that I expect to be pretty instrumental to whether or not [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3626.44s)]
*  they win LeBaron Filan is another one too, that I would throw out that I really, [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3629.4s)]
*  really like a lot for, for Alabama. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3633.44s)]
*  But, uh, yeah, I could, I'll, I'll wait until you circle around and we can. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3635.44s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just starting. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3639.28s)]
*  There's five that we finally have more time to watch stuff. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3640.72s)]
*  Hey, so I want to talk Celtics a little bit because we got the big documentary [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3643.2s)]
*  Celtic city coming on March 3rd, Monday on Max and on HBO. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3646.12s)]
*  Um, you follow the history of the league. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3650.72s)]
*  You try to intersect it with the guys we're watching now. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3653.28s)]
*  Is there anybody from all of the different Celtics errors that you would [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3655.44s)]
*  have loved to have seen in 2025? [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3659.04s)]
*  Oh man, that's a great question. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3661.48s)]
*  I mean, I think bird bird, you can't count bird. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3663.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3665.92s)]
*  I remember when I was making that Indiana travel video last year, I think I was [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3666.28s)]
*  texting you about, I was going back and watching some of the Indiana state [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3669.84s)]
*  footage and I was just thinking bird absolutely would have translated to today. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3672.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3677.7200000000003s)]
*  No problem. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3678.04s)]
*  Just because of the space you went over it's spatial intelligence. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3678.8s)]
*  Um, I mean, over the, over the decades, um, I think Ainge is a pretty fascinating [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3681.6s)]
*  player, um, when he was younger, uh, just seeing the way that he was able to, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3687.12s)]
*  just obviously a really smart player. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3692.16s)]
*  Um, Dennis Johnson, I'm a big fan of, I think in the era of ball [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3694.3599999999997s)]
*  pressure, he would have translated. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3697.88s)]
*  Um, I'm trying to think of this. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3700.16s)]
*  The, do you mean, [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3701.44s)]
*  how about Mikhail? [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3703.2s)]
*  Cause I feel like Mikhail is now a unicorn that will never happen again, [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3704.7999999999997s)]
*  because whatever version of Mikhail happens in 25, that guy's just [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3709.2799999999997s)]
*  shooting threes all the time. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3713.56s)]
*  It's up, which started to happen to Mikhail at the end of his career. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3714.72s)]
*  He started stretching them for more. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3718.12s)]
*  I just don't know if a low post guy would ever have that arsenal moves [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3719.9199999999996s)]
*  anymore because you'd be, it would just be banged in your brain. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3723.9599999999996s)]
*  If she threes and clear space, get out of the way for other people. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3727.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't see it happening again. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3732.8399999999997s)]
*  I, he's somebody that I think would probably, this kind of reminds me of our [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3735.16s)]
*  conversation when we were like creating the all time fun team, he's somebody [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3738.64s)]
*  that I think would have probably been the fulcrum of a, a, a big guy driven [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3741.68s)]
*  offense with movement around him. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3748.3599999999997s)]
*  Just like a little Shungun, Shungun on Houston, tiny bit. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3750.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3753.24s)]
*  Because if you had the right guards around him, he was such a dominant one [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3753.6s)]
*  on one player, he would have been pretty, Shungun is an interesting, I don't, [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3757.2s)]
*  where would you, where would you compare Mikhail and Shungun as passers though? [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3761.64s)]
*  I think. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3764.9199999999996s)]
*  Uh, Mikhail became a better passer because he played with Bird. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3766.64s)]
*  It was that Osmosis thing. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3772.16s)]
*  I think if Mikhail's on another team, he's probably like 1.1 assists a game. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3773.8799999999997s)]
*  But I think when you play with somebody who's just always making extra passes, [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3777.7999999999997s)]
*  there's no way you don't start doing it. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3781.3999999999996s)]
*  It's one of the great things about basketball. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3783.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3785.04s)]
*  I guess, I guess like you would have had Mikhail would have been a center. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3785.3599999999997s)]
*  You would have put shooting all the way around him and just tried to get him on [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3788.52s)]
*  the low post with space and, uh, that, that would have been a good one. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3792.64s)]
*  The types like the parish types, you know, those guys now they're, they're just [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3797.16s)]
*  valued completely differently in the league, you know, cause back then you owe [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3802.3199999999997s)]
*  it every team needed one or you needed a center to guard the other centers. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3806.52s)]
*  And now those guys are like 15 to $20 million players. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3809.56s)]
*  And then, or you'll see a team like the Lakers. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3814.0s)]
*  They're just like, I guess we're just not going to have a center. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3815.7999999999997s)]
*  Um, or it's somebody like the way the Celtics use Porzingis and [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3818.3599999999997s)]
*  Horford as like these stretch fives with size that, you know, ideally you [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3821.3599999999997s)]
*  can kind of play them off the ball and then have them come flying in on the paint. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3826.32s)]
*  Um, it's just, there's not a lot of parish types now. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3830.1600000000003s)]
*  Detroit probably plays the closest to what an old older era team plays like. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3833.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3839.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3839.88s)]
*  With it, they have size and rebounding and they're tough and nasty. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3840.6000000000004s)]
*  They have a couple shooters and then they have one really good [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3844.4s)]
*  offensive player and it's just kind of. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3846.7200000000003s)]
*  It's like a 1991 type of team. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3849.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3851.4s)]
*  And they've gotten, well, they, we knew this in the past few years was for [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3851.92s)]
*  the player type that Cade was and where he was in his growth, they [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3856.16s)]
*  tweaked some things to help him out. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3859.3199999999997s)]
*  It was, it was, I was, I kept calling it the crowded elevator. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3861.2s)]
*  It was, Cade was just like, there are just too many people on the elevator. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3863.68s)]
*  Can you please get off? [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3867.16s)]
*  The other one I was going to, in making this documentary, did you feel any kind [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3868.2799999999997s)]
*  of burden, I'm not trying to interview you here, but did you feel any kind of [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3873.48s)]
*  burden to represent somebody that was maybe not properly represented in the [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3876.8799999999997s)]
*  younger generation, because I think of like a Havlicek, if you look at his stat lines, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3881.44s)]
*  so balanced throughout, was there anybody that you felt like a burden to be like, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3885.8399999999997s)]
*  we really should focus on this guy to, to bring out, you know, to make sure, [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3891.2s)]
*  to shine a light on his like legacy. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3896.12s)]
*  Yeah, we had a few of those. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3898.36s)]
*  Havlicek is definitely one who was a incredibly important player to the [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3900.04s)]
*  league in the seventies, especially as one of the legacies to Russell in the [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3905.36s)]
*  Celtics, but also like as the ABA is getting more and more fun, he's one of [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3909.48s)]
*  the few stars they had left. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3913.16s)]
*  Uh, Reggie Lewis was a big one. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3915.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3917.52s)]
*  Um, and we hadn't really seen that. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3918.2799999999997s)]
*  You know, we, we have a lot of Reggie stuff and the last third of the series. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3920.8799999999997s)]
*  And, uh, I just think he's one of those that kind of came and went. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3925.96s)]
*  People remember he died, but they don't remember how good he was and how important [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3929.8399999999997s)]
*  he was to the Celtics. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3933.0s)]
*  That was, that was another one. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3933.92s)]
*  Then there's a little, like, there's moments as you go through where you're [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3935.24s)]
*  trying to explain the impact of somebody. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3938.2799999999997s)]
*  Cousy, I mean, Cousy is a big part of the first episode, how important he was to [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3940.64s)]
*  the league, you know, that the league just wasn't entertaining, you know, they [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3946.2799999999997s)]
*  didn't have a shot clock for eight years. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3950.7599999999998s)]
*  And it was just, it was just a bunch of, you've seen some of the old videos, like [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3952.6s)]
*  it's brutal and it's just a lot of big guys and it's a lot of set shots and [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3956.7599999999998s)]
*  running hooks and then Cousy comes in and he's easily the most fun player in [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3960.6s)]
*  the league and he's the most fun player in the league, probably for the first [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3966.16s)]
*  15 years of the league until Elgin and, and Jerry West and Oscar kind of get [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3969.0s)]
*  going. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3974.2s)]
*  And the way he ran fast breaks and just some of the old footage, it's like, it's [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3976.0s)]
*  impossible not to enjoy the way those teams played. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3979.08s)]
*  It's so different. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3982.32s)]
*  It's the same sport, but it has no correlation to what we're watching now. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3983.08s)]
*  Everything's about three on two, three on one, two on one, four on two. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3986.4s)]
*  Can we get a layup? [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3990.52s)]
*  Can we get a layup? [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3991.2400000000002s)]
*  Can we get a layup? [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3991.96s)]
*  And that's like the driving force. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3992.7200000000003s)]
*  Now you're running in the same place and the guys are splitting out to the corners [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3994.6s)]
*  and Cousy would be running and he'd be like doing like over the head tosses to [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=3998.2400000000002s)]
*  somebody in the corner. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4002.1200000000003s)]
*  It's just really different. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4003.1600000000003s)]
*  So yeah, there is some pressure with some of that just to explain like, Hey, [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4004.7200000000003s)]
*  here's why this person was special for four minutes. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4008.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4010.6800000000003s)]
*  The context is just so infuriating whenever you hear people talk about like [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4010.96s)]
*  the history of the league, because if you like talking about Cousy, people just [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4014.36s)]
*  drive me nuts because they'll go back and use the lens of today and watch the [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4017.88s)]
*  way he's dribbling. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4021.2400000000002s)]
*  The officiating of dribbling is like one of the things that single-handedly [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4022.5200000000004s)]
*  changed the way the game is played. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4026.36s)]
*  Like it just blew the walls down. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4027.96s)]
*  I had a clip of Domo. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4031.1200000000003s)]
*  You're talking about the carrying. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4031.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4033.48s)]
*  They, they used to, it was so strict. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4034.1200000000003s)]
*  Your hand had to be directly on the top of the ball. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4036.76s)]
*  And you know, I made a video with this one time you just watched over the [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4039.88s)]
*  decades, the hand, the hand went from the top to kind of on the side to totally [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4042.48s)]
*  on the side to under now it's, I think it's been a good thing. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4046.1600000000003s)]
*  I think it promoted self-expression, which is what the league marketed itself on [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4050.7200000000003s)]
*  and exploded, but I just think Cousy is one that is funny to watch. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4055.48s)]
*  If you imagine a game where you had to dribble the way that he did, it was [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4059.76s)]
*  pretty creative. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4064.28s)]
*  Granted the league wasn't, I don't know, integrated or anything like that. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4064.84s)]
*  Definitely was that. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4067.88s)]
*  So you had the dribbling thing, you had the sneakers, the fact that they're [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4069.84s)]
*  playing and you know, just these rinky-dank conferences and, and then it [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4074.36s)]
*  was really, really physical, you know, you're just, people are just like, [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4079.84s)]
*  Chloe, it was more like hockey. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4082.76s)]
*  They call them Cagers. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4084.08s)]
*  You know, the first 15 years of the league. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4085.3199999999997s)]
*  So it's a, it's a different sport. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4087.2799999999997s)]
*  The other thing with the assists, like they're scoring all these points. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4089.7599999999998s)]
*  You only got an assist if it was like the guy is catching the ball and like [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4092.96s)]
*  laying it or the guy is catching it and shooting middle or they didn't count it. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4096.5199999999995s)]
*  So I've heard old guys complain about that. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4100.24s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4102.72s)]
*  I mean, they complain, they must complain about so many different things, but, uh, [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4103.5599999999995s)]
*  like the equipment they had, the money they didn't make, all the statistical [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4107.679999999999s)]
*  rules against them, but, uh, but yeah. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4111.84s)]
*  And then, you know, it's, it's, we try to use the Celtics as a lens to look at [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4114.4s)]
*  the league and the sport and how it changed and how it intersected with [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4119.28s)]
*  America and all these different ways. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4122.2s)]
*  And, um, it is, it is hilarious how the footage changes over the years. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4123.839999999999s)]
*  Even you watch the stuff from the eighties, like that, like we have a big [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4129.96s)]
*  part about the Boston Philly series in 1981, which is like probably my favorite [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4133.599999999999s)]
*  series ever, but that becomes, it's just a UFC fight. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4138.0s)]
*  It's like a 10 man UFC fight. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4142.599999999999s)]
*  There's no spacing at all. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4144.5199999999995s)]
*  Every time somebody goes to the basket, they're just getting clobbered and it [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4146.28s)]
*  becomes this kind of hybrid of like rugby basketball at UFC by the fourth quarter. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4150.36s)]
*  And that's like, he was just, you wouldn't really see that. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4155.28s)]
*  We see elements of that sometimes with the big tense games, but not like that. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4157.4s)]
*  There's not, there's not, there will never be another series like that. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4161.639999999999s)]
*  I don't think. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4164.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4165.16s)]
*  It's interesting. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4165.48s)]
*  I was watching some games. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4166.32s)]
*  I think I was trying to watch something for Jerry West one time and I was just [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4167.679999999999s)]
*  amazed at the way he and Oscar Robertson would drew. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4170.76s)]
*  Hey, I was amazed at the pickup point. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4175.92s)]
*  I think that is something that has really evolved now with the [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4177.8s)]
*  thread of the deep three point shot. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4180.52s)]
*  Teams just pick up way higher than they did in the past. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4182.4400000000005s)]
*  You'd watch legitimate stars with the ball, like a Jerry West who today, if [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4185.400000000001s)]
*  Jerry West dribbled up the floor, he would be a threat from, I would say 28 and in. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4191.64s)]
*  I mean, like, you like legitimately would take those shots and you would [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4196.320000000001s)]
*  watch him dribble literally to the, to the elbow before he gets contact. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4199.72s)]
*  And he'd pull up for that jumper. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4204.56s)]
*  And I wonder if some of that is what you're talking about. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4205.84s)]
*  Just the clogged lane so many times that that shot was just available. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4208.0s)]
*  I mean, Oscar Robertson did that, did that, did that a lot too, but I think [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4212.56s)]
*  the pickup point is something that has really, really changed over the decades. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4215.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4219.56s)]
*  That's how the 85 Lakers won the finals. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4219.72s)]
*  They just stacked it. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4222.76s)]
*  And if you watch some of the footage from that Danny Ange and DJ, they're not [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4224.08s)]
*  just wide open from three, they're wide open from like 18. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4227.96s)]
*  So Lakers are so packed. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4231.68s)]
*  They're just not letting Michaela and Bird beat them. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4232.8s)]
*  And they're just like, take those 18 footers all day. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4235.36s)]
*  And the Celtics kind of didn't know how to respond. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4237.4s)]
*  And when you watch it now, you're just like, why didn't you guys move back? [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4240.2s)]
*  You would have just had wide open threes. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4243.68s)]
*  You would have made one out of every three. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4245.4s)]
*  The points per possession would have been more, but you know, nobody, [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4246.8s)]
*  nobody really thought that way. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4250.36s)]
*  Um, they, there's some, there's a lot of good stuff, I think for the basketball [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4251.68s)]
*  junkies, I think they're going to be, uh, they're going to be pleasantly surprised. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4256.08s)]
*  We were able to pack a lot of stuff in this thing. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4259.5199999999995s)]
*  Is that you believe in the Pistons yet, by the way, I forgot to ask you about them. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4262.0s)]
*  I think they're in, they are on the path toward that young teams need to be on, [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4265.32s)]
*  which we've talked about in the past. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4270.12s)]
*  Whenever you have a young team, you have a coach, you have sort of your startup [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4271.6s)]
*  CEO who comes in and is just trying to make everybody feel good. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4275.08s)]
*  And then you're like, all right, we need, we're going public. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4278.32s)]
*  We need a real CEO and you go get the person. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4279.84s)]
*  And I think they did that. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4282.28s)]
*  So I think we're in the phase of they're going to be entering the playoffs. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4283.36s)]
*  And then you, it's sort of like Orlando did you get, you enter the playoffs, you [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4286.48s)]
*  get the data, read back on that and you say, this is because the playoffs define [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4290.639999999999s)]
*  everything you, you always talk about fourth quarters in the playoffs and it's [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4294.5199999999995s)]
*  like those things come back and this is, this is what we saw, this is what happened. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4297.28s)]
*  This is the map towards what we need to do. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4301.44s)]
*  So that's kind of, that's where they are in the process right now for me. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4303.12s)]
*  So we're going to see what kind of, the way teams play them. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4306.2s)]
*  And then that's going to inform the moves that they make. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4309.48s)]
*  So they're on the, they're on the path to Detroit fans. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4312.28s)]
*  They seem to hate think I hate Kate. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4314.96s)]
*  I don't really understand that, but yeah. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4316.4s)]
*  So, but they're, they're, they're on the right track. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4318.4s)]
*  So it's a tough one. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4321.56s)]
*  Cause and Marcelo never wavered on Kate, but last year, I don't understand it, [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4322.6s)]
*  but I think, you know, it's it, he was a different guy than he was this year. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4327.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4333.8s)]
*  And everyone's admitting really from the last couple of months, anyone who [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4334.44s)]
*  listened to any of our stuff or any of this stuff we were doing, like it was [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4338.52s)]
*  like something's really good is happening with Kate Cunningham here. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4341.36s)]
*  And it keeps going and going and going. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4344.5599999999995s)]
*  And the veteran shooters they put around them, I think is a good model [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4346.36s)]
*  for how to build a team. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4349.36s)]
*  It's interesting though. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4351.24s)]
*  Like right now they're sixth. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4352.799999999999s)]
*  They have a chance to bump to four or five. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4355.04s)]
*  If I were them, I'd want to be in that six spot and I'd want to play the Knicks. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4358.96s)]
*  Cause I think they, I think they could give the Knicks a shitload of trouble. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4362.799999999999s)]
*  They're, they're a really tough physical team. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4366.639999999999s)]
*  They, they're probably, if they're not the best rebounding team in the [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4370.16s)]
*  league, they're in the top three. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4373.36s)]
*  Um, I just would have wanted to see them in a playoff series. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4375.32s)]
*  And it's probably a year too early. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4378.5199999999995s)]
*  It's probably like what Orlando is like last year. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4379.84s)]
*  It was like, Oh, watch out for these guys. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4381.96s)]
*  And then they shoot 20% in a game seven. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4383.5599999999995s)]
*  But, uh, when you can rebound and you have veteran shooting and you have one guy [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4386.639999999999s)]
*  that you can go to in the last five minutes, I just, I'm taking you seriously. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4391.5199999999995s)]
*  So I knew they were going to beat the Celtics last night, no Jaylen Brown, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4395.2s)]
*  third game and fourth night. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4398.0s)]
*  It's kind of a bad matchup. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4398.92s)]
*  Celts are kind of stuck in the second spot. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4400.68s)]
*  Like that felt like a loss, but it's still a really nice win for Detroit. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4402.84s)]
*  Like they've won eight straight. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4407.04s)]
*  I'm taking them, I'm taking them seriously as at least a first round upset thread. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4409.24s)]
*  I think you have to think of them that way now. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4413.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4415.08s)]
*  There's they're in that position where they're, they may not beat the Knicks, [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4415.4800000000005s)]
*  but they're in the position to like really take a bite out of them when they, [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4419.04s)]
*  you know, as they end the next round, which is, you know, they're definitely [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4422.0s)]
*  not going to be a pushover. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4424.64s)]
*  And I think you're right about they have these, they had the guys that were [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4425.4s)]
*  athletic, you know, a SAR and, and, and Jaylen Duran, Duran is somebody that I [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4428.4s)]
*  was really high on. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4432.839999999999s)]
*  I couldn't believe the way he got stolen in that draft. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4433.719999999999s)]
*  He was somebody that very obviously fit the archetype of somebody that could [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4436.24s)]
*  switch and he's just super athletic. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4439.599999999999s)]
*  So sort of a poor man's band type of type of archetype guy. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4441.5199999999995s)]
*  Um, and then the shooting, a lot of the times that's the simplest answer. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4445.08s)]
*  You got a downhill guy, just add some space around him. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4448.28s)]
*  It seems like it's not rocket science, but teams, uh, Pistons finally did it. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4450.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, their top five net last 15 games are plus 7.6. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4454.919999999999s)]
*  That's like, if you're, if you're in the top five for a 15 to 20 game stretch at [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4460.759999999999s)]
*  this point of the season, I think you have to be taken seriously anyway. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4465.04s)]
*  All right, Kyle, man, I'll, I'll, we'll you'll come back at some point when we're [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4469.0s)]
*  in the March madness throws, but it was good to see you as always. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4472.799999999999s)]
*  Likewise. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4476.599999999999s)]
*  Good to be here. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4477.16s)]
*  All right. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4477.96s)]
*  Susan Morrison is here. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4478.2s)]
*  She works for the New Yorker. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4479.2s)]
*  She wrote a big biography on Lauren Michaels that came out last week or this week. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4480.76s)]
*  Last week, last week. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4485.92s)]
*  And, uh, how long were you working on it? [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4487.400000000001s)]
*  Because it felt like this was like almost a decade's worth of work. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4489.12s)]
*  It was just about a decade. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4491.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4493.400000000001s)]
*  Just about a decade. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4493.76s)]
*  How did you convince him to do it? [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4494.8s)]
*  Because you got some, I mean, you spent an entire week behind the scenes in a, [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4496.4400000000005s)]
*  in an episode Jonah Hill hosted last decade, but also it just seemed like you [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4501.76s)]
*  got a lot of Lauren time, which is pretty unusual. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4505.68s)]
*  I did. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4507.84s)]
*  And I know, I recognize how unusual that was. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4508.44s)]
*  And that's, I think, I mean, it's, it's, it's worked for me. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4511.0s)]
*  Well, basically after the 40th anniversary, uh, 10 years ago, I started [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4514.96s)]
*  thinking about the show and the enormous impact of Lauren himself, you know, [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4519.36s)]
*  nobody has been more responsible for what makes, you know, generations of [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4523.639999999999s)]
*  Americans laugh, what we all think is funny and, you know, it's a huge legacy. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4528.04s)]
*  And I knew Lauren a little bit because I worked for him briefly in 1984. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4533.28s)]
*  Uh, on the new show, which was his one spectacular public failure, um, his [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4538.16s)]
*  attempt to do SNL in prime time. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4543.4s)]
*  And I was just a kid. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4546.0s)]
*  I was a munchkin then, you know, but I had a front row seat to this [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4547.6s)]
*  interesting, um, situation and I made a lot of friends there, even though I [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4550.2s)]
*  switched to journalism, I kept in touch with all those people. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4554.68s)]
*  So I would see Lauren maybe every eight or 10 years and, uh, we always said hi. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4557.08s)]
*  And, um, so I decided, I knew Lauren wouldn't say yes to having a book [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4562.08s)]
*  written about him. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4567.44s)]
*  So what I did is I wrote a proposal, send it around. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4568.24s)]
*  I was surprised by the interest it generated. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4572.0s)]
*  There was a big bidding war. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4574.28s)]
*  I signed a deal with random house. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4575.759999999999s)]
*  I had not promised them Lauren's involvement. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4577.32s)]
*  And then I wrote a note to Lauren and I said, I'd love to come see you in your office. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4580.679999999999s)]
*  So I went to see him and I said, Lauren, I've just signed a deal to write a book [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4585.32s)]
*  about you and the show. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4589.08s)]
*  Um, I don't need anything from you because, you know, I'm connected in your world. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4590.08s)]
*  But if you would like to talk to me, it'll be a bigger and better and richer book, [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4595.280000000001s)]
*  you know, which your legacy deserves. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4599.92s)]
*  And, um, you know, the truth is he looked like he was going to faint. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4602.56s)]
*  He was surprised and he doesn't like to be surprised as you know, if you've read [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4607.08s)]
*  the book, uh, but it was incredibly polite as he always is. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4611.68s)]
*  And we chatted about this and that for a while. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4615.240000000001s)]
*  And he said, let me give us some thought. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4617.8s)]
*  And, um, so a few days later I followed up and we met for a drink. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4619.4400000000005s)]
*  At a bar in a hotel. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4624.56s)]
*  And, um, I thought we were going to be negotiating. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4626.0s)]
*  That's that it would maybe be like, well, this and that. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4629.8s)]
*  And, uh, but as often happens with Lauren, people say that sometimes you sit down [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4631.96s)]
*  with Lauren and he starts a conversation. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4636.68s)]
*  And you're like, wait a minute. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4638.72s)]
*  So I missed the previous conversation. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4639.4400000000005s)]
*  Like, you'll just kind of leap ahead. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4641.0s)]
*  And that's what happened. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4643.080000000001s)]
*  We sat there. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4644.0s)]
*  He was drinking his Belvedere on the rocks and he just started telling [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4645.280000000001s)]
*  stories about his childhood, about his parents. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4648.320000000001s)]
*  And I realized, oh, he's going to do this. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4651.52s)]
*  You know, I didn't have a notepad or a tape recorder. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4654.44s)]
*  So I would run the latest human, write stuff down, forget it. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4658.5199999999995s)]
*  And, um, you know, he asked nothing of me. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4661.799999999999s)]
*  There were no terms. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4665.12s)]
*  There was no deal. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4666.16s)]
*  He just, uh, I think, you know, he liked me. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4667.04s)]
*  He respected the magazine. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4669.839999999999s)]
*  Uh, I think he knew there was going to be a book written about him better [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4671.719999999999s)]
*  it be written by me than, you know, some kind of entertainment business hack who [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4675.5599999999995s)]
*  was going to turn something around really fast. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4679.5199999999995s)]
*  And so then I just started visiting him in his office, you know, a couple [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4681.8s)]
*  Friday nights a month, then we would have these leisurely talks and it was very [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4687.4s)]
*  civilized and really fun and, uh, you know, talk to everyone else in his world. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4692.32s)]
*  And the, the, the charm, the, the real charm of it for me was that I didn't [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4696.759999999999s)]
*  have to deal with any publicists. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4701.0s)]
*  And that can really be the backbreaking part of a project like this. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4703.04s)]
*  I think that, you know, once word went out that Lauren was talking to me, all [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4705.759999999999s)]
*  these people just said, sure. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4709.48s)]
*  You know, and everyone loves to talk about Lauren. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4710.68s)]
*  So, uh, you know, after we had done that for a year or so, then I realized, okay, [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4713.96s)]
*  if I'm going to write this guy's biography, you know, you, you, you want to avoid it [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4718.4400000000005s)]
*  being like a death march through the years, you know, 1986 turned to 1987, [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4722.92s)]
*  turned to 1988 and I'm a magazine editor. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4727.68s)]
*  So I wanted some of that up close in the room material like you [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4730.76s)]
*  have in a magazine profile. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4735.240000000001s)]
*  So I said, you know, how about if I just come to the show one week and just [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4736.4400000000005s)]
*  stay at your elbow and watch everything, you know, so I can convey to people the, [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4740.56s)]
*  the magic and the insanity of how this show comes together every week. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4746.68s)]
*  Uh, you know, I, I kind of related to it a little bit because it's not [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4751.68s)]
*  completely unlike the way we put together an issue of the New Yorker. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4755.120000000001s)]
*  You know, we have a weekly deadline, a lot of crazy egomaniacs, you know? [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4758.320000000001s)]
*  So, and he let me, and, uh, so I was able to sit there through all these very [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4763.0s)]
*  intense, usually confidential meetings and got to see all the complicated levers [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4768.08s)]
*  that he has to push and the egos that he has to solve. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4774.16s)]
*  And it was, you know, I sometimes said to my editor, this book could be, you know, [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4777.48s)]
*  published by Harvard Business School. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4783.32s)]
*  I mean, it's, it's, it's a funny, interesting book, but it's, it's [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4784.8s)]
*  a real management Bible too. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4787.28s)]
*  So I was shocked that he let you hang by his side for an entire show like that, [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4790.0s)]
*  especially if they're having pretty candid conversations about Jonah Hill was [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4795.08s)]
*  the host that week and the psychology of getting a host to either buy into a [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4798.8s)]
*  sketch or sometimes like him not wanting to promote a mid nineties Lauren didn't [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4803.36s)]
*  want to promote it, even though Jonah Hill had this movie he directed and he's [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4809.84s)]
*  like, ah, we don't do directors. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4812.76s)]
*  We only do actors, but all the little tidbits you got from that, I just couldn't [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4814.0s)]
*  believe he allowed, he allowed you in that inner circle, but do you think part [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4818.16s)]
*  of it was because he knew the book was coming out so much later than that [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4822.8s)]
*  episode that it was okay. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4826.84s)]
*  Like if he had done it and it had just all run like a week later, I think that [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4828.96s)]
*  would have been weird, but seven years later, it seemed okay. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4832.2s)]
*  Cause there's a lot of other stuff in there too. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4835.360000000001s)]
*  Like they're having problems with Leslie Jones that week and she's hitting that [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4837.400000000001s)]
*  point where she's probably outgrown the show and everybody's realizing it. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4841.08s)]
*  But you had all this stuff in there that after seven years, it seemed more [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4844.360000000001s)]
*  benevolent than maybe in 2018. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4847.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, the first thing I'll say is certainly Lauren, neither Lauren, nor I [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4849.76s)]
*  knew that it was going to take that much longer. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4854.120000000001s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4856.64s)]
*  Okay. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4857.320000000001s)]
*  I mean, I, you know, I, I, I, I, I, the book took this long just because it took [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4857.68s)]
*  this long, you know, I interviewed hundreds of people, I have a demanding day job. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4863.120000000001s)]
*  You know, I did the weekends, but still I don't think, I don't think [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4866.360000000001s)]
*  Lauren's that strategic. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4870.400000000001s)]
*  I don't, I don't think he's thinking like, Oh, this will be some years. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4871.64s)]
*  I think he just felt like he, again, it was a great honor for me that he [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4875.320000000001s)]
*  just trusted me. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4879.44s)]
*  And I did say to him at the beginning of that week, I said, I know how this goes. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4880.719999999999s)]
*  You know, if somebody blurt something out, that's really controversial or [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4885.08s)]
*  disgraces themselves or some confidential thing happens that you would like to be [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4889.48s)]
*  off the record, let's check in at the end of each day and you can tell me, you know, [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4895.04s)]
*  that's the way at the magazine, we would maybe deal with it if we had a journalist [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4899.36s)]
*  visiting a meeting or something, but he never did. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4902.5199999999995s)]
*  He never said, Oh, you know, when so-and-so blurted out, blah, blah, blah. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4906.0s)]
*  Let's, let's erase that. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4908.84s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4910.360000000001s)]
*  He never did. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4911.360000000001s)]
*  Um, and, you know, but again, I think it's that, you know, he respected me as a [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4912.64s)]
*  journalist and, and knew that I wasn't going to, you know, I wasn't out to hang [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4917.4400000000005s)]
*  anybody or burn the place down. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4921.8s)]
*  And, um, and I'll tell you the truth. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4924.0s)]
*  I mean, there were a handful of things, particularly the Saturday night, the party [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4926.4400000000005s)]
*  after the show where people were wandering around, you know, a little blitz [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4930.12s)]
*  and blabbing things that, you know, I mean, just because I'm a, you know, I'm a [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4934.52s)]
*  good journalist, but I'm also not out to nail anybody. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4938.04s)]
*  And I think I probably protected a couple of people here and there, but, but the [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4940.92s)]
*  book is really true to what happened into my experience. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4944.64s)]
*  And I, as I said, I felt honored by being trusted that way. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4947.64s)]
*  Well, cause if you go back to the eighties and there was that great book that, uh, [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4951.16s)]
*  Helen Weingrad wrote about the first 10 years of the show. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4955.04s)]
*  And as they're finishing that up, Woodward comes out with the book about [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4957.64s)]
*  Belushi and they talk about in the Saturday night live book that came out. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4961.76s)]
*  But the 10 years, like there was a show with those guys because they felt like [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4965.88s)]
*  they were burned by the Belushi book. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4969.96s)]
*  They'd given Woodward all this access. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4971.56s)]
*  And then he just steered the book toward basically the cocaine downfall of [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4973.400000000001s)]
*  Belushi and it seemed like they were, they basically made it seem like Lauren [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4976.88s)]
*  kind of scaled back right at the end. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4980.400000000001s)]
*  And he hasn't really done anything since. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4982.320000000001s)]
*  And I was wondering, like, did he feel like, all right, was it, cause you even [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4984.0s)]
*  have a quote in the book about basically he's like, the less talking you do about [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4988.400000000001s)]
*  how well you're doing, the better off you are, which I thought was interesting. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4992.8s)]
*  But then at the same time, he's letting you do this book. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4995.72s)]
*  Yes, it's true that he has always had a policy that there isn't much to be [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=4998.56s)]
*  gained by talking to the press. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5002.12s)]
*  You can be quoted out of context, you know, all these things can happen. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5003.76s)]
*  And they did feel burned by Belushi, um, by, I'm sorry, by wired. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5006.96s)]
*  A lot of people, including Jim Belushi, uh, told me that they felt that they had [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5011.360000000001s)]
*  been misquoted in the Woodward book and that things were taken out of context. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5016.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, I mean, that kind of, that happens a lot in this business. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5021.400000000001s)]
*  I, um, you know, I, I'm not in a position to fact check Woodward's book, but I, I [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5025.08s)]
*  mean, I was really careful, you know, I've been working at the New Yorker for 30 years. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5030.32s)]
*  I really careful in the research. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5034.32s)]
*  I had a fact checker check everything. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5036.72s)]
*  You know, I, uh, I think that there was a level of comfort with how [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5038.72s)]
*  I was going to be doing it, but you're right. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5042.76s)]
*  Uh, I think that the only reason that he kind of went against his usual [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5045.08s)]
*  dictum, which is nothing to be gained by talking to the press is that it was [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5050.28s)]
*  right after the 40th, uh, the 40th anniversary is remember it was a, it [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5054.92s)]
*  was a beautiful show. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5058.52s)]
*  It was very emotional. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5059.28s)]
*  I think Lauren was a little softened by it. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5060.76s)]
*  And I think he, if he felt it, that they were celebrating the 40th and, you [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5063.68s)]
*  know, Phil Hartman was gone and, and, and Belushi and Gilda and so many people [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5069.0s)]
*  and Tom Davis and, and I think he thought, God, it's going to be even a [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5074.68s)]
*  smaller group at the 50th. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5079.68s)]
*  I think he was for the first time really thinking about his legacy, you know? [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5081.16s)]
*  And, and, and I just happened to kind of get him at the right time. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5085.0s)]
*  And, um, I definitely felt that he was reflective in a way that isn't maybe [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5089.84s)]
*  his norm, I mean, you've, you've interviewed him, you've talked to him. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5095.64s)]
*  He doesn't, he's not naturally that interior person. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5098.16s)]
*  So I think that, uh, uh, it was just good timing. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5102.400000000001s)]
*  He also, you know, I'll say he's, I think he's a little bit superstitious, which I [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5106.84s)]
*  love, and, uh, when we met that first time in his office, you know, I told you, [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5110.4800000000005s)]
*  he knew me from the eighties, but I told him something he didn't know, which is [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5115.120000000001s)]
*  that when I was 16 in the, during the first season of the show, I took the [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5118.6s)]
*  Metro North train in from Connecticut and was in the audience for one of the [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5123.76s)]
*  Elliott Gould shows, which was magic. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5127.76s)]
*  And it was one of his favorite shows from that season. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5130.120000000001s)]
*  And I think there is something that kind of that sparked something in his brain. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5133.24s)]
*  It felt right to him. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5137.12s)]
*  You know, yeah, I felt that same way when he let me do the pod in his office. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5138.360000000001s)]
*  I think he knew like, I love the show and, you know, it meant a lot to me. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5141.56s)]
*  And I had a lot of history with it. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5145.2s)]
*  What struck me when I interviewed him, first of all, his recall is amazing. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5146.4800000000005s)]
*  Yes. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5150.92s)]
*  Um, I was really surprised by just how specifically he could remember stuff [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5151.24s)]
*  going back to the seventies and eighties, like it happened yesterday. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5155.360000000001s)]
*  But the thing that you mentioned earlier about how this book could be [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5158.6s)]
*  like, uh, almost like a, like a business class for management. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5161.92s)]
*  That was the, his, his sense of how to direct people, how to nudge people, [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5166.08s)]
*  the different points of a career you hit, um, knowing what the shelf life is of a [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5173.64s)]
*  relationship with somebody and whether they're going to leave or actually [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5179.08s)]
*  whether they're going to stay under the umbrella and just kind of stay there, or [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5181.88s)]
*  they're just going to go and are they going to come back? [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5185.08s)]
*  It seems like he's probably put more thought into this than just about anybody. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5188.16s)]
*  Cause a lot of people have managed successful companies. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5192.56s)]
*  Not a lot of people have managed a successful company that also has to do [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5196.52s)]
*  with all the things that come with fame and managers and agents and the temptations [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5200.56s)]
*  and, you know, whether you stay loyal to the infrastructure or the show or you [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5206.400000000001s)]
*  leave and you do something else. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5210.200000000001s)]
*  And it just felt like he had put like an extraordinary amount of thought into it. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5211.68s)]
*  And that was one of the things I loved about your book is like, it's really in [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5215.639999999999s)]
*  there, like you really feel like all these different examples of like, it's [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5218.599999999999s)]
*  time for them to go or they're going to find out the hard way that they shouldn't [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5222.5199999999995s)]
*  have left. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5226.12s)]
*  Like he, it just seems like that's like one of the legacies of Lauren basically. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5226.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5231.24s)]
*  I mean, one of the things, um, Chris Rock was a great source, very smart guy. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5231.44s)]
*  And he said, think about it. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5235.879999999999s)]
*  This guy has been hundreds, if not thousands of people's boss. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5237.4s)]
*  And if that doesn't make you an expert on human behavior, you know, what does, I [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5241.639999999999s)]
*  mean, he's, he's, he's almost like a shrink. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5245.719999999999s)]
*  He's seen so many people go through this weird crucible, right. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5248.2s)]
*  Of change. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5252.88s)]
*  You think about like Bill Hader comes from Oklahoma in his early 20s. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5253.88s)]
*  His only job had been working, you know, and as an assistant on iron chef, right. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5257.679999999999s)]
*  And so you see these people and then they become famous overnight. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5263.08s)]
*  You know, Lauren says he's the world's expert on watching people get famous, [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5267.72s)]
*  you know, and very often he, he, he's fully aware there's like an asshole phase. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5271.8s)]
*  You know, you become a big jerk for a while. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5277.04s)]
*  And he kind of, [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5279.04s)]
*  it's a thing like if it lasts, if it lasts more than 15 minutes, you just stay an [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5279.52s)]
*  asshole or you had some quote like that. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5283.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5285.84s)]
*  So he knows how to shepherd people through this, but in terms of like the [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5286.12s)]
*  management approach, I think that, I think it's a lot, it's largely intuitive. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5290.400000000001s)]
*  Like I, you know, I remember Judd Apatow, a hearing once about how, when he was a [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5294.84s)]
*  25 year old or 26 year old young show runner working on Ben Stiller's Fox [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5299.92s)]
*  variety show in the eighties, which is a great show that got canceled right away. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5307.52s)]
*  He was terrified. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5311.28s)]
*  He didn't know how to manage people. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5312.16s)]
*  He was holed up in his office, reading, you know, management for dummies, like [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5313.24s)]
*  trying to learn how to do it. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5317.08s)]
*  Laura never did anything like that. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5318.84s)]
*  I think he is a lot of it is intuitive. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5320.320000000001s)]
*  He's got great EQ, but also, and this was the fun part about researching the book. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5324.0s)]
*  I mean, sometimes I think he's almost like a, a young character out of [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5329.4400000000005s)]
*  Dickens or something, like every stop along the way, every bad job that he had. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5332.68s)]
*  He nonetheless learned something important from it. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5338.56s)]
*  Like you can see him going through the first 30 years of his life, gathering [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5341.16s)]
*  the little individual skills to becoming a producer and learning how to deal with management. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5345.64s)]
*  Especially his interactions with stars. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5349.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5352.16s)]
*  Just like, Oh, I learned this from Flip Wilson. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5352.719999999999s)]
*  Oh, I learned this from Lily Tom. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5355.16s)]
*  And he just takes it. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5356.599999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5357.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5358.48s)]
*  And the other thing that's unusual about him is that not only is he good at [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5359.12s)]
*  dealing with those kinds of incandescent creative egos or narcissists, but at the [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5363.32s)]
*  same time, he's a guy who has the mellow confidence to be able to deal with the suits. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5369.4s)]
*  You know, a lot of Conan O'Brien said to me, you know, in the game of thrones of [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5374.959999999999s)]
*  show business, you know, Lauren will be the last one standing. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5380.0s)]
*  And if you think about the number of, uh, administrations of, of NBC ownership, he [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5382.6s)]
*  has outlived, uh, Mike sure, uh, the, the S S and L writers now created a lot of [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5390.0s)]
*  different shows. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5397.04s)]
*  I quote him talking on a podcast once about, you know, what it's like to work [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5398.52s)]
*  for GE, you know, GE owned the network for a long time and he quotes the network [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5403.56s)]
*  or pretends to quote a network saying something like, something like, gee, how [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5408.84s)]
*  come our laser guided missile department is doing so much better than our fart [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5412.4400000000005s)]
*  joke division? [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5416.6s)]
*  So you're working for people who are basically making toaster ovens, you know? [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5418.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5422.56s)]
*  And he knows how to kind of ride it out when those people turn into pests. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5423.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5427.96s)]
*  You did a good job with theirs. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5428.16s)]
*  Cause there's a couple eras with that. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5429.400000000001s)]
*  Where he just trust the infrastructure and that there's going to be a people above [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5432.4800000000005s)]
*  him. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5436.88s)]
*  And if he could just kind of hold onto the steering wheel and like the thing he [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5437.6s)]
*  says over and over again, people is you just got to stay in the air. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5441.400000000001s)]
*  He's got to keep it going. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5444.32s)]
*  How do I stay on? [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5445.32s)]
*  Because all the most famous stage for this was probably the Don Ulmer era, the [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5446.28s)]
*  mid nineties when he's trying to get rid of the show and Lauren could have like [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5451.08s)]
*  escalated it, turned into nuclear war and maybe he gets bounced, but he just [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5455.52s)]
*  kind of, it's kind of held the fort. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5459.04s)]
*  What happened, what Conan did, you know, with the tonight show, when he made this [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5460.68s)]
*  social movement out of which Lauren hated. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5465.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5468.679999999999s)]
*  That, that to me that Lauren, that was like exactly what you don't do. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5469.08s)]
*  You know, what you do do is you just keep your head down and, and ride it out [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5472.48s)]
*  and then stay on the air thing again, to look at the lessons that he garnered [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5476.08s)]
*  along the way in the, in the, in the sixties and seventies, when he was working [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5479.76s)]
*  in LA on variety shows, you know, he was on laughing, but he knew that the cooler [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5484.679999999999s)]
*  show was the Smothers Brothers. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5489.24s)]
*  That's for Steve Martin wrote and Rob Reiner. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5490.76s)]
*  And he kind of wished he were on the Smothers Brothers, but then the Smothers [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5493.44s)]
*  Brothers basically allowed themselves to become martyrs. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5497.6s)]
*  They wouldn't let up on their, um, and be on their Vietnam stuff. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5501.32s)]
*  You know, they, they had Pete Seeger on singing way steep in the big muddy and [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5505.84s)]
*  the president called Bill Paley and got them taken off the air. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5511.16s)]
*  And, and Lauren, I think always felt like, yeah, they did great material, but they [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5515.68s)]
*  didn't, you know, they didn't get to stay on the air. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5520.8s)]
*  And if you're not on the air, you're nowhere. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5523.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5525.64s)]
*  You have a couple of good stories about the shelf life of the moment you have. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5525.84s)]
*  One of them was the Smothers Brothers, right? [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5530.320000000001s)]
*  Where it's like they were cool and then you fade, you turn into something else. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5532.12s)]
*  It also, you know, he could feel it probably happened in the early eighties [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5536.84s)]
*  when Letterman became the cool show, which you talked about, too, when SNL [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5540.4800000000005s)]
*  was all of a sudden a little late and Letterman is now the new person. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5544.04s)]
*  And I mean, one of the great things about this book, I knew so little about that [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5548.320000000001s)]
*  five year stretch when he wasn't on SNL and just like grabbing all of these [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5552.360000000001s)]
*  different ideas and things and really none of them worked out other than just [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5559.0s)]
*  getting Broadway video to buy a bunch of IP from the show, which turned out to be [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5563.52s)]
*  really smart financially, but all the creative stuff, none of it really worked out. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5567.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5570.68s)]
*  And, and you could that, you know, he thought his TV life was over then he [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5571.0s)]
*  thought, oh, that I did my TV thing. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5575.04s)]
*  Now I'm going to have my Mike Nichols moment. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5576.8s)]
*  You know, he always wanted to make a film like The Graduate and he [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5578.64s)]
*  thought that was his destiny. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5581.32s)]
*  You know, his grandparents owned a movie theater. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5582.96s)]
*  He grew up besotted with the movies. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5584.84s)]
*  And, and what's interesting is that, you know, he was working on an [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5587.36s)]
*  adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5592.24s)]
*  You know, he was, he had bought the rights to Don DeLillo's, [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5594.24s)]
*  oh gosh, you know, the one that Noah Baumbach just made, White Noise. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5599.96s)]
*  And, you know, these are really high brow pictures. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5602.88s)]
*  They weren't like Animal House, which is what you might've expected him to do, [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5606.08s)]
*  you know, go in a Bofo comedy direction. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5610.360000000001s)]
*  So that didn't work out. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5612.8s)]
*  And the thing, the only thing he did during those years that brought him [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5614.12s)]
*  pleasure is he, he wrote Three Amigos with two of his best friends, you know, [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5618.28s)]
*  Steve Martin and Randy Newman. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5624.24s)]
*  And he described that to me as like the one time where he just felt, this is what [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5625.88s)]
*  I always pictured it to be like, you know, like George S. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5630.28s)]
*  Kaufman staying up all night with the Marx brothers, drinking too much coffee [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5633.2s)]
*  and fixing the third act. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5636.8s)]
*  And I think he realized that, you know, he, he doesn't, he doesn't want to sit [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5638.5199999999995s)]
*  alone in a room with a typewriter. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5643.5199999999995s)]
*  He wants to be brainstorming with his friends. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5645.08s)]
*  He likes a clubhouse, you know, his whole life he's been looking for a tribe. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5647.0s)]
*  And so that's what made him go back to SNL in 1985. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5651.36s)]
*  But it also, I mean, you laid out part of why he went back to SNL in [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5655.84s)]
*  1985 is it didn't seem like he totally knew what to do. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5659.36s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5662.799999999999s)]
*  And this was like the one thing that he knew he was good at and he had tried all [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5663.2s)]
*  these other things that would just never totally fit. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5666.759999999999s)]
*  Oh, he was horribly in debt. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5669.48s)]
*  He'd lost his own money on the new show. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5671.32s)]
*  He had a mortgage, his apartment. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5673.04s)]
*  I mean, this side, the idea of Lauren, you know, in financial distress was [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5674.679999999999s)]
*  something that he, you know, it almost reminds me of Scarlett O'Hara, you know, [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5678.92s)]
*  I'll never be poor again, because when he was 14, his father died suddenly and his [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5683.16s)]
*  whole life changed and there was financial uncertainty. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5687.5199999999995s)]
*  It was, it was, his mother was depressed and you know, he's one of those guys [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5690.48s)]
*  with catastrophic thinking who kind of lived his whole adult life to make sure [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5694.599999999999s)]
*  that never happened to him again. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5697.5599999999995s)]
*  So when he was presented with the offer to come back and save SNL after five [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5699.2s)]
*  years away, he first, he didn't know what to do. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5705.08s)]
*  His pride felt a little wounded like, Oh, is that just going backwards? [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5707.48s)]
*  And he had- [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5712.32s)]
*  Well, we should mention they were probably, the show's probably dying if he [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5712.599999999999s)]
*  doesn't come back. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5715.4s)]
*  Yes. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5716.08s)]
*  So he's got that. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5716.28s)]
*  They were going to cancel it. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5716.88s)]
*  He's got that guilt trip part of it too. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5717.56s)]
*  So it was save your baby or we're going to kill it. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5719.28s)]
*  And so he asked for advice from two mentors and he always had a lot of mentors [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5721.6s)]
*  in his life in the same way that he would go on to be everybody else's mentor. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5727.4400000000005s)]
*  So the first one he asked was David Geffen, who was his first agent way back [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5730.68s)]
*  in the day and Geffen said, you know, Lauren, you should not go back and take [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5735.32s)]
*  that job in New York. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5740.36s)]
*  You know, you've done that. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5741.400000000001s)]
*  Someone who wants to be you should do that. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5742.56s)]
*  And I love Lauren's response to that because it's very honest. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5745.12s)]
*  He said to me, he said, well, you know, I always kind of liked being me. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5749.44s)]
*  So then the second person he asked, much more sage than the older man, Mo [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5754.44s)]
*  Austin, who was the chairman of Warner Brothers records, Mo was a much more [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5759.84s)]
*  clear-eyed and he said, look, you're great at that job. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5766.04s)]
*  You love New York city. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5769.28s)]
*  There are very few big entertainment jobs in New York city. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5770.5599999999995s)]
*  It's a perfect fit. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5773.8s)]
*  You should go back. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5774.72s)]
*  And, and I think that the penny dropped and Lauren realized, yeah, I'm [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5776.2s)]
*  good at live television and you know, Jim Downey, one of the, the, the [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5780.0s)]
*  longest serving head writers on the show has a great way of summing up what he [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5785.56s)]
*  thinks Lauren's strengths are that make him so good at live TV. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5790.4400000000005s)]
*  He said, Lauren's a guy. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5794.280000000001s)]
*  Not that great at term papers, really good at tests. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5796.04s)]
*  You know, in other words, the hard deadline is necessary for him. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5799.8s)]
*  You know, with movies, he could kind of noodle around with rewrites and never [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5803.96s)]
*  actually get to the end of it. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5808.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5810.04s)]
*  I like that part of the show goes on because it's 1130, no matter what. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5810.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5814.12s)]
*  I liked how you laid that out, that some people, their weaknesses, they [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5814.320000000001s)]
*  can't stop tinkering with something, you know, and it could be anything, right? [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5818.24s)]
*  It could be a magazine feature you're editing, it could be documentary. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5822.08s)]
*  It could just somebody that never feels like it's done and they [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5825.12s)]
*  can't make final decisions. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5827.8s)]
*  But when you, when you're on, on Saturday, 1130, I, one of my favorite [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5829.28s)]
*  things about your book was that process of going between dress rehearsal and, [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5832.76s)]
*  and you laid out everything that happened in that Jonah Hill show from dress [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5838.400000000001s)]
*  rehearsal, right? [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5841.76s)]
*  Till when they go live, when Lauren turns into like a different human and he's [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5843.08s)]
*  just like, all right, here's what we, and it's like the one time all week where [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5846.360000000001s)]
*  he's just, he has to make decisions. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5849.6s)]
*  Now people have told me, and this I'm pleased as people have told me that [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5852.72s)]
*  when they're reading that section of the book, their heart starts pounding. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5856.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5860.68s)]
*  And when you're in that room and think about it, every, it's a tiny, not a big [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5861.4s)]
*  room, this is the ninth floor office, every square inch of the carpet. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5865.68s)]
*  I mean, people are on there kneeling on their knees cause there isn't even room [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5868.96s)]
*  to sit down in Indian style. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5871.96s)]
*  Everyone's crammed in there. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5873.68s)]
*  It really is like a scene, you know, they're about to go into battle and, and [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5875.32s)]
*  you could just, you can feel the tension. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5879.4800000000005s)]
*  It's thrilling. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5881.68s)]
*  And that's obviously what makes the drives, the adrenaline and the, you [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5882.68s)]
*  know, magic in the show that. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5887.08s)]
*  That tension, uh, because many people have critiqued it over the years and said, [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5889.56s)]
*  wait a minute, you know, why don't we just pick the actual seven sketches on Wednesday? [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5893.92s)]
*  And then we don't have to have this whole hunger games rigmarole. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5899.2s)]
*  But I think Lauren knows that keeping that creative tension and the competition [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5903.2s)]
*  and the, that that is good for creativity. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5909.12s)]
*  Well, one thing that was, and I'd never really thought about it correctly until [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5913.24s)]
*  I read what you wrote, but like, I never thought of all the factors. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5916.76s)]
*  I would always think like, Oh, he'll just pick the seven funniest things. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5921.04s)]
*  But the stuff he's weighing about, like, is this cast member in the cast too much? [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5924.4400000000005s)]
*  Um, did the audience respond in the dress rehearsal? [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5929.4400000000005s)]
*  Are we going to have the right amount of energy in this part of the show? [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5933.240000000001s)]
*  So he's like, he's on some different plane that it seems like only he can see [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5935.64s)]
*  this, which makes me wonder how anybody can take that job after him, even though [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5939.320000000001s)]
*  he's 80, but like, how do you come in? [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5943.2s)]
*  And there are all these other factors beyond just what's funny. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5945.28s)]
*  What's not funny. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5948.679999999999s)]
*  Now, maybe somebody would just approach it completely differently and be fine. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5949.639999999999s)]
*  But I just hadn't thought about it before. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5952.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5955.4s)]
*  It's, it's Steve Higgins calls it like five dimensional chess. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5955.599999999999s)]
*  He's thinking, do I keep the host happy? [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5958.5599999999995s)]
*  Do I make sure like the show I was at, you know, I think one of the reasons [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5961.08s)]
*  that, you know, one of the sketches got canned is just because it was these [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5964.719999999999s)]
*  huge movie theater seats that were just too damn hard to get in and out of the [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5968.679999999999s)]
*  doors. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5972.64s)]
*  So like next, you know, and, um, [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5973.04s)]
*  and it's like 20,000, 20,000 dollars down the drain. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5975.76s)]
*  The moment they say no thanks. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5978.92s)]
*  Have time to get the prosthetic head on, you know? [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5980.8s)]
*  Um, and there's so many things that, you know, all week, I mean, and this is, [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5983.64s)]
*  this probably is a decisive management choice. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5989.6s)]
*  One of the things that's so cool is that all week long, Lauren is soliciting [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5993.64s)]
*  opinions from everybody and not just the writers and the cast, but you know, [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=5997.92s)]
*  the costume assistants, the pages, you know, he wants to hear from everybody. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6002.52s)]
*  He likes to think of it as an egalitarian enterprise that everyone is as [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6007.160000000001s)]
*  necessary as everybody else. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6010.92s)]
*  And I know that sometimes in meetings, even he has a sheet of paper and he'll [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6012.72s)]
*  jot down every time someone has spoken because he wants to make sure everybody [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6016.76s)]
*  in the room says something. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6021.72s)]
*  And then, so he's, he's metabolizing all those points of view all week. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6023.4800000000005s)]
*  And then there's a moment after the dress rehearsal, when he walks up this [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6029.0s)]
*  little cinder block staircase, it's like the least glamorous place in the [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6034.160000000001s)]
*  building up to his office. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6038.200000000001s)]
*  And I just thought of this now. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6039.96s)]
*  It's almost like, do you watch severance? [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6041.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6043.92s)]
*  You know how they go in the elevator and then they go, and then, you know, it's [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6044.64s)]
*  like, he goes up the staircase and he becomes the other guy. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6048.040000000001s)]
*  So then he's in his office and suddenly he's not thinking about what everybody [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6051.64s)]
*  else says. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6056.96s)]
*  It's just him. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6057.4s)]
*  It's just, so the whole week is about him peeking for that hour. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6058.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6061.4800000000005s)]
*  And then he goes up the stairs, becomes Superman, and then he is the decider and [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6061.68s)]
*  everything that comes out of his mouth. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6066.12s)]
*  Like it's him, it's him, it's him, it's him. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6067.64s)]
*  And so to see that transformation, like it is really, it's really interesting. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6069.8s)]
*  Well, one of the great things about that week you spent with, with the show was [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6075.2s)]
*  the show that's in dress rehearsal and then gets, or the sketch that gets bumped [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6079.76s)]
*  is this Beavis and Butt-Head sketch that they couldn't figure out. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6084.5199999999995s)]
*  And then they ended up doing it with Ryan Gosling last season. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6087.44s)]
*  Yeah, five years later. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6090.44s)]
*  And it's one of the best shows of the decade. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6090.76s)]
*  And it's like, holy shit, that's the same sketch. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6092.64s)]
*  It was dead for five years and came back. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6094.64s)]
*  I know, I know. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6097.2s)]
*  And I remember thinking, you know, Louisa, Louisa Carey and the amazing makeup [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6097.92s)]
*  and prosthetics guy, he worked all week on those heads. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6102.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6105.64s)]
*  And Lorne wasn't completely getting it. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6106.56s)]
*  Uh, first he said, oh, I feel like it's just kind of cone heads, redux. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6109.44s)]
*  You know, and then he also didn't understand why Jonah kept being in [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6114.04s)]
*  profile, which he thought looked really awkward. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6117.2s)]
*  And then somebody had to say, no, no, in Beavis and Butt-Head, you [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6119.72s)]
*  always see him in profile, but it just wasn't really gelling. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6122.08s)]
*  But yes, I mean, I kudos to the writing staff to hang that they hung onto that. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6125.68s)]
*  I mean, they must have like 10 of those a year where they're like, I can't [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6131.2s)]
*  believe he didn't pick that one. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6134.16s)]
*  Let's just like save it. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6135.4s)]
*  Well, I saw it in dress and I'll tell you, it was a whole lot [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6137.56s)]
*  better when Gosling did it. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6140.68s)]
*  So, right. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6141.88s)]
*  We're right. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6142.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6142.88s)]
*  There's reasons he didn't do it. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6143.08s)]
*  But you know, another thing that was fun to learn, like I didn't know that the [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6144.280000000001s)]
*  cowbell sketch existed before Walk-In and that they did it and tried to do it [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6147.56s)]
*  when Norm MacDonald hosted and yet you can see, like, can you imagine anyone [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6153.76s)]
*  but Walk-In doing that now? [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6157.96s)]
*  No. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6159.200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6159.64s)]
*  Well, I mean, going through the years, one thing I appreciated was he was really, [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6160.4800000000005s)]
*  really grateful for some cast members that popped up at the right times. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6167.12s)]
*  And the guy that he really effusively praised was Dana Carvey, who I still [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6171.24s)]
*  feel like is the most underrated star of the 50 years. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6176.44s)]
*  He doesn't get mentioned in the Mount Rushmore, but he should. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6179.639999999999s)]
*  And he was basically, Lauren has these different quotes. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6182.679999999999s)]
*  She was like, this guy was a machine. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6185.16s)]
*  This guy could do everything. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6186.8s)]
*  We wrote, we were able to ride him for the late eighties, basically. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6188.04s)]
*  And it seems like he felt that way about Ackroyd. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6192.04s)]
*  He felt that he wasn't there for Eddie Murphy, but Eddie's in there. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6195.84s)]
*  Will Ferrell was like that. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6198.599999999999s)]
*  Was there anybody else that he talked about where it was just clear Lauren was [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6199.8s)]
*  like, this is a Mount Rushmore guy for me or lady? [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6202.96s)]
*  I think Phil Hartman. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6206.400000000001s)]
*  Definitely. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6207.320000000001s)]
*  I mean, and all of these people you've just mentioned, like they're, they're [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6207.92s)]
*  actors, you know, I mean, they're really in it. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6212.2s)]
*  They can, you know, somebody described Ackroyd as the kind of guy who kind of [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6215.400000000001s)]
*  kind of zipped himself into a character and disappear into it, you know, very [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6219.68s)]
*  different from like the way Belushi performed, which is he's always a [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6224.4400000000005s)]
*  Belushi-esque character, you know. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6226.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6229.16s)]
*  He's a force of nature. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6229.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, you had that great thing about Ackroyd about how if they needed to do [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6230.56s)]
*  the sketch in three minutes instead of three and a half, he would talk faster [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6233.52s)]
*  to make them move it along. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6236.76s)]
*  That's right. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6238.12s)]
*  I think that among the women, I think, well, I think Jan Ho. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6239.360000000001s)]
*  Kristen Wiig has to be right. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6241.96s)]
*  Kristen Wiig definitely. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6243.24s)]
*  And one of the things that's amazing about Kristen Wiig, and I started, when I [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6244.24s)]
*  started watching, rewatching the shows more carefully, you see that what she [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6247.68s)]
*  does that's different from a lot of comedy performers is her acting, her, [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6251.400000000001s)]
*  everything she does is so small. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6256.2s)]
*  You know, she does so much with less, like just little movements of her eyes or [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6258.2s)]
*  even like her, if you look at her, Denise character with a forehead, like it's, [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6263.44s)]
*  it's so subtle. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6267.639999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6269.08s)]
*  Hader said once to me that the unbelievable thing about her was every single [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6269.96s)]
*  character she ever did was slightly different than there was no like, oh, [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6275.599999999999s)]
*  I'll do this and I'll just have a wig on. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6280.16s)]
*  It was like, each thing was slightly different than the other thing. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6281.84s)]
*  Like she was just reinventing new people each time, which they were like, [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6284.44s)]
*  how does she do that? [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6289.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6290.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6290.879999999999s)]
*  No, no. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6291.08s)]
*  I think definitely. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6291.36s)]
*  I mean, I think Kate McKinnon is a great actor. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6292.5599999999995s)]
*  I think Jan Hooks, it was just incredible. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6295.04s)]
*  And she also tends to, I mean, of course she gets shoved under the rug. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6298.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6302.879999999999s)]
*  I'm with you. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6303.12s)]
*  I almost, I did my all time cast and she was the one I was, that was like one of [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6303.5199999999995s)]
*  the toughest cuts for me because I just feel like for four or five years, she [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6308.5199999999995s)]
*  was amazing, could do anything. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6313.0s)]
*  I also like the people that can sing and perform and do sketches and do characters. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6315.32s)]
*  Like there's like some sort of total package thing that I think only a few of [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6321.6s)]
*  them have really pulled off. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6326.08s)]
*  You know, [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6327.24s)]
*  well, one of the things that I loved, you know, getting, cause I hadn't really [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6327.56s)]
*  gotten it until I spent a whole lot of time there is that the thing is that all [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6331.88s)]
*  of them at the end of the day, they're just theater kids, you know, they're all [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6337.32s)]
*  people who did guys and dolls in high school. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6341.96s)]
*  You know, even like Lauren, there's a, there's a bit in the book where Lorraine [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6344.4800000000005s)]
*  Newman described how once she was with him in the seventies and she had just had [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6347.96s)]
*  a bad breakup and he, and Lauren launched into that song from West Side Story. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6353.28s)]
*  Forget that boy. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6357.96s)]
*  Like the idea, you know, I mean, I, I have two daughters who were theater kids. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6359.88s)]
*  So I'm very familiar with this type, but all of them, you know, I remember seeing [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6363.64s)]
*  Colin Firth interviewed once about how much he loved doing, you know, the scene [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6367.16s)]
*  in Abba where he's in the jumpsuit and the, and the platform shoes, because [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6371.96s)]
*  everybody was an actor. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6376.12s)]
*  They just want to do that, you know? [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6377.32s)]
*  And it was also very interesting to hear Lauren talk about, and just to see with [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6379.24s)]
*  all of them, how, you know, the audience is always projecting onto SNL, you know, [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6384.68s)]
*  they want it to be a political show or an anarchist collective or whatever, but [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6389.2s)]
*  it's really show business. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6393.08s)]
*  It's just show business. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6394.76s)]
*  And that's why often when you see these scenes shot backstage, you'll look down [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6395.84s)]
*  the hall and you'll see a couple of showgirls, a man dressed as Abe Lincoln and [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6401.0s)]
*  a llama, you know, it's, it's like that scene. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6405.84s)]
*  I don't know if you're as much of a Beatles nut as I am, but like in hard days [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6408.360000000001s)]
*  night, there's that scene in the theater where John Lennon's going down the stairs [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6412.04s)]
*  and he runs into a show girl with a headdress and like, yeah, even the Beatles. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6415.76s)]
*  It's just showbiz. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6420.04s)]
*  There's something I kind of love about that. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6422.24s)]
*  Um, we're going to take a break and come back and I want to talk about [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6424.76s)]
*  Lauren as Confucius. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6428.52s)]
*  Okay. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6430.24s)]
*  All right. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6431.04s)]
*  Lauren as Confucius, which seems to be a recurring theme with everybody [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6431.2s)]
*  who's been in his orbit. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6435.24s)]
*  He just dropped shit. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6436.88s)]
*  Like I just, I took down some couple of things from your book that I screenshotted. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6437.96s)]
*  He was talking about Belushi taking Chevy Chase's overnight fame, the hardest. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6442.28s)]
*  And he said, there's a certain kind of person who, if they're not famous by 26, [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6446.8s)]
*  they're going to burst into flames. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6451.04s)]
*  Which I thought was like, yeah, he's, he's probably seen that too. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6453.84s)]
*  These people that come on the show and they're like so anxious to have it all [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6457.2s)]
*  happen, but it seems like he seems to feel like, except for the rare [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6460.96s)]
*  exceptions like Carvey, you almost need two years on the show before you [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6465.32s)]
*  can become who you are. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6469.32s)]
*  Like what, what did you find out when you're researching the book? [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6470.84s)]
*  Like what's the, what's the arc of a cast member to actually [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6473.32s)]
*  be really good on the show? [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6476.16s)]
*  Well, I think that, um, I think he really likes and respects the ones who come in [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6478.08s)]
*  there and survey the scene and figure out, okay, this is how I can be effective here. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6483.36s)]
*  Like plenty of them. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6489.12s)]
*  And again, they're young, you know, they, there's no orientation. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6490.24s)]
*  There's no instruction packet. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6493.92s)]
*  Like it's sink or swim. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6495.4s)]
*  You know, you have to figure out, okay, who can write for me? [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6496.639999999999s)]
*  Who can I write with? [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6499.639999999999s)]
*  How am I going to get on the air? [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6500.5599999999995s)]
*  And, and the ones who can sort that out, you know, are, are the, are the ones [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6501.799999999999s)]
*  who are really going to make it. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6506.24s)]
*  Um, yeah. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6507.28s)]
*  Uh, well then there's someone like Kristen Wake comes in and she's just immediately, [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6508.799999999999s)]
*  you could tell she's going to be on the show for seven years. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6512.6s)]
*  There are a few shortcuts, like, and this began with, uh, Billy Murray when, you [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6516.360000000001s)]
*  know, when he started on the show in the second season, he had a good first show [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6521.160000000001s)]
*  and then he just kind of disappeared. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6524.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6526.68s)]
*  Didn't like him. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6526.92s)]
*  Audience didn't like him because they thought he was a Chevy replacement and [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6527.8s)]
*  he wasn't so cute as Chevy. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6531.200000000001s)]
*  And, but you know, he was playing like second cop parts. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6532.84s)]
*  So Lauren and he devised this idea that Billy would come on the show behind a [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6535.56s)]
*  desk and just address the audience and just say, Hey, I'm not cutting it here. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6541.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6545.32s)]
*  What's the matter people? [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6545.6s)]
*  Don't you like me? [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6546.32s)]
*  And they talked about his dead father and everything, but that did it. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6546.84s)]
*  You know, he connected with the audience. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6549.92s)]
*  They really liked him and he was in, and that kind of began this tradition of. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6551.32s)]
*  One of the time honored ways that, that new cast members kind of get, get their [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6556.76s)]
*  footing is to go on weekend update as themselves and say their name into the [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6561.24s)]
*  camera. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6567.6s)]
*  I mean, think of Adam Sandler when they did his first Thanksgiving song, you [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6568.08s)]
*  know, he was not really thriving so much on the show, but then he came in, he was [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6572.4s)]
*  himself, he looked like himself. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6576.64s)]
*  He did his funny little song. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6578.04s)]
*  Everybody knew, Oh, I know that guy now. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6579.44s)]
*  And the week, Eddie Murphy did that too. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6581.64s)]
*  It's Raheem Abdul Muhammad. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6583.64s)]
*  That was the first time he did that. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6584.92s)]
*  That was it. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6586.88s)]
*  And he took off. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6587.5199999999995s)]
*  So that, so that works, you know, and, um, the week I was there, Melissa Villasenor [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6589.04s)]
*  had one on update and that she broke through. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6593.12s)]
*  So, you know, there, there are a lot of different kinds of shortcuts. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6596.5199999999995s)]
*  Some people are just so good at it. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6600.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, look at Kenan Thompson. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6602.32s)]
*  He's been there forever. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6603.4s)]
*  He just, you know, I think he recognizes it as a good thing. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6604.24s)]
*  Lauren will often say that, you know, agents, people's agents and managers are [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6608.2s)]
*  the menace because they'll suddenly start getting like movie offers and they'll [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6613.48s)]
*  say, Hey, get out of this place. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6616.92s)]
*  You got to leave. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6618.28s)]
*  You know, it's time to leave. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6618.84s)]
*  And Lauren, you know, does a lot of sidebar conversations with these people. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6620.48s)]
*  And what he, what he says, another one of his Coen's is, you know, make them, [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6624.68s)]
*  let them build a bridge that's strong enough so they can walk across it and walk away. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6629.88s)]
*  But yeah, that was another Lauren Confucius thing. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6634.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6637.280000000001s)]
*  And there are so many of them. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6637.64s)]
*  And some of them, what I love is some of them actually can't figure out [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6639.52s)]
*  what the hell I mean. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6643.200000000001s)]
*  And writers and casts spend years talking about them. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6643.96s)]
*  And one that a lot of people mentioned to me is something he would say, well, [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6647.92s)]
*  you know, there's people who build the house and there's people who buy the house. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6652.36s)]
*  And you have to figure out which one you are. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6656.639999999999s)]
*  And everyone is like, what does that mean? [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6659.24s)]
*  What if I'm both? [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6662.36s)]
*  Yeah, you had, uh, the one, I mean, this is another one. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6666.04s)]
*  We was talking about Chevy chase when, uh, he said the idea that you could feel [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6670.679999999999s)]
*  things for somebody and then you run out of it, I realized, so people burn out of [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6676.599999999999s)]
*  relationships. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6681.6s)]
*  And he said that about, um, he said that about a family member, but he was talking [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6682.280000000001s)]
*  about Chevy chase, like sometimes the professional relationship, it just is [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6686.84s)]
*  what it is. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6692.64s)]
*  It's supposed to be four or five, six years, and then it's over. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6693.160000000001s)]
*  And that's, it's like real life. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6696.400000000001s)]
*  And you have to walk away. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6698.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6699.400000000001s)]
*  And I think it was, you know, when he started the show and had the original, not [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6699.56s)]
*  ready for prime time players, they were just kind of supposed to be in the [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6705.68s)]
*  background. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6708.68s)]
*  Nobody was supposed to become a star. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6709.400000000001s)]
*  You know, no one was supposed to become famous. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6711.6s)]
*  So when suddenly Chevy was famous and he was on the cover of New York magazine, [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6713.360000000001s)]
*  that totally messed up the ecosystem. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6716.84s)]
*  It created, you know, it was a loss of innocence to use one of Lauren's [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6719.4800000000005s)]
*  favorite terms and everyone. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6723.400000000001s)]
*  Back then too, it's 30 million people watching the show potentially on a [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6725.200000000001s)]
*  Saturday night. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6728.64s)]
*  It's just different level. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6729.360000000001s)]
*  And so it was very painful for him to see this tribe, his family fractured. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6730.6s)]
*  And then, but when Chevy did go, he was painful as it was again, this was one of [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6736.280000000001s)]
*  these lessons that he had to internalize. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6740.16s)]
*  He realized, okay, this is going to happen again and again and again. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6742.16s)]
*  And so he sort of inured himself to it. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6746.16s)]
*  But he also realized that, you know, like George Steinbrenner or like any sports [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6748.28s)]
*  team, you have to keep bringing in rookies. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6753.24s)]
*  You have to seed the team. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6755.8s)]
*  And that's something he learned the hard way, you know, but, but he, he, that's [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6758.08s)]
*  what, that's how he's kept it going for 50 years. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6762.92s)]
*  That's always a new people. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6765.4s)]
*  I think that's one of the reasons I connect with the, the whole structure of [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6767.16s)]
*  the show, because it's a lot like sports. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6771.400000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6773.6s)]
*  You have to constantly think about like, all right, this person's taken off. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6774.12s)]
*  I probably only have them for two more years. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6777.400000000001s)]
*  Now I got to develop a bench behind them. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6779.24s)]
*  Uh, another thing that I loved, we, I shouldn't mention this, uh, three minutes [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6781.320000000001s)]
*  ago, but his, his hatred of agents and managers and how, how just their agenda [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6785.28s)]
*  doesn't align, you know, they're all they're doing is just trying to get [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6792.64s)]
*  whoever the most amount of money. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6795.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6797.52s)]
*  They don't care about career. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6797.72s)]
*  They don't care about relationships and how he tries to navigate that. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6799.08s)]
*  But it's like one of the few things he can't hide his contempt for, [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6802.64s)]
*  which is like these people. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6806.2s)]
*  I think I, I somewhere in the, at least one place he says in the book, [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6808.360000000001s)]
*  agents are morons, you know, right. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6811.92s)]
*  And the thing they, they all hate more than anything is when agents get [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6813.76s)]
*  tickets to the show and they're in the audience. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6816.88s)]
*  I mean, people have told me, but, you know, cause they're so jaded. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6818.96s)]
*  I mean, you want the real fans. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6822.08s)]
*  You don't want an agent. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6823.32s)]
*  So you'll look up at the balcony and you'll see a bunch of, you know, [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6824.36s)]
*  CA agents and their dates asleep. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6827.04s)]
*  They're half asleep. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6829.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6829.88s)]
*  More stuff. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6831.12s)]
*  But about the Steinbrenner thing. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6831.8s)]
*  And this, I w I, I found myself wondering if this had something to do [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6833.8s)]
*  with your affinity for the show. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6836.68s)]
*  You know, Lauren, he is a sports guy. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6838.56s)]
*  I mean, loves the Yankees goes to the Knicks. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6840.56s)]
*  He's a big hockey guy and he uses a lot of sports metaphors all the time. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6843.4s)]
*  You know, he's a lot of baseball metaphors. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6848.28s)]
*  Um, when Will Ferrell was talking to me about Lauren style, he said, you [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6850.759999999999s)]
*  know, Lauren's like, he's like a baseball manager, you know, as you've got to [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6855.08s)]
*  keep the highs, not too high and the lows, not too low, cause it's a long season. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6858.4s)]
*  And a lot of people, you know, use sports talk to talk about how the show works. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6863.719999999999s)]
*  And the other thing people say is that the closest thing to SNL on television [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6868.96s)]
*  because it's live is sports. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6874.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6876.88s)]
*  You know? [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6877.4s)]
*  Well, yeah, it's like a live sporting event. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6877.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6879.679999999999s)]
*  Well, you had stuff in there about how a compliment from him is it's rare. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6879.76s)]
*  So when you get one, it means something, but it isn't the cast members [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6885.0s)]
*  that succeed the best. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6888.719999999999s)]
*  I've talked about this. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6889.719999999999s)]
*  It's like a basketball team where when you play basketball, it's not just [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6890.599999999999s)]
*  about, oh, clear out, I'm going to score it. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6894.28s)]
*  Like you're, you're trying to make other people better. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6896.679999999999s)]
*  You're trying to connect with people. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6898.599999999999s)]
*  You're trying to move without the ball and set picks. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6899.92s)]
*  And those are the people that always do best on the show. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6902.04s)]
*  Here's another Lauren quote. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6905.44s)]
*  The trouble with a thankless job is that no one thanks you, but you could put [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6907.080000000001s)]
*  the shit in like, in like fortune cookies. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6911.6s)]
*  I know. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6914.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6915.120000000001s)]
*  That's a great marketing idea. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6915.240000000001s)]
*  And he talked about why he's devoted to the show when it takes every ounce of [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6918.88s)]
*  my strength to get it on and there's nothing but resistance and nobody seems [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6923.4400000000005s)]
*  to give a fuck that I want out because you can only give up your life for [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6927.320000000001s)]
*  something greater than you so far. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6931.04s)]
*  It's been worth it. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6933.360000000001s)]
*  Now he's 80 and he's still giving up his life for the show. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6934.120000000001s)]
*  But there's other reasons for that, right? [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6936.56s)]
*  Like the moment he's not running SNL, you're not getting your calls [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6938.56s)]
*  returned in quite the same way. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6942.72s)]
*  Like there's a power that comes with the show that I think he's aware of. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6944.160000000001s)]
*  I think it's so much his whole life and his whole personality. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6947.200000000001s)]
*  I don't think he's going to leave there unless it's on a stretcher, you know? [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6950.4800000000005s)]
*  And, and he always says that if you, if you're, if producing was done well, [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6953.68s)]
*  you leave no fingerprints. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6958.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6960.64s)]
*  And that's true. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6960.84s)]
*  And that's sort of why he's been behind the curtain all these years, but the [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6961.52s)]
*  same time his fingerprints are on everything, you know, it, every one of them [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6964.92s)]
*  has absorbed his sort of gospel and his sense of values about the show and not [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6970.76s)]
*  just about the show, but about how to live their lives, you know, in addition to [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6976.2s)]
*  all of his comedy rules and axioms, he teaches them how to live, how to live in [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6979.16s)]
*  New York, how to order in a restaurant, you know, uh, [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6984.36s)]
*  Yeah, he's paying for like new teeth for cast members and all kinds of things. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6987.36s)]
*  And the gifts he gives are so like, you get the, people have told me, Oh, he gave me [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6990.6s)]
*  this really great luggage or Simon Pierce glassware and you sort of feel like he's [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=6995.8s)]
*  ushering them into the good life. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7000.68s)]
*  I was with Jim Downey once when he opened this box, it was an Hermes, big orange [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7002.68s)]
*  box, it was an Hermes sweater for his birthday. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7007.96s)]
*  And he was so intimidated by it, you know, and he Googled it and saw how expensive [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7010.88s)]
*  it was and he said, I have to get a safety deposit box for this thing. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7014.320000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7016.96s)]
*  He had a story about that you have in the book that I'd never heard about when [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7020.56s)]
*  Ray Charles was on the show and, uh, he was going to be reunited with all these [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7024.4s)]
*  people that he had done all this great stuff with. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7029.72s)]
*  And he's like, are you excited to see them? [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7031.64s)]
*  And Ray Charles said most of them owe me money and wasn't excited at all. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7033.04s)]
*  And he's like, all right, I'm going to tuck that story away too. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7036.4800000000005s)]
*  Down the road, you know, these special relationships I allegedly have might not [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7039.76s)]
*  be so special 20 years from now. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7044.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7046.52s)]
*  I mean, again, that's the sort of keep the highs, not too high, the lows, not too low. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7046.8s)]
*  I mean, he, he, there's a way in which all these people, they are his family [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7050.32s)]
*  members, he's recreated the family that, you know, he lost when his father [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7054.2s)]
*  suddenly died when he was a child. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7057.96s)]
*  But there's also, you know, it's also business. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7060.2s)]
*  I mean, he managed, he walks this very fine line. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7063.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7066.2s)]
*  Well, and also when he went, when he stopped doing SNL after the first five [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7066.72s)]
*  years, you have a thing about, yeah, the phone's not quite ringing the same way. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7069.92s)]
*  There's some Conan O'Brien stuff in this book that I've believed and felt for [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7075.72s)]
*  a while that you really got into. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7079.280000000001s)]
*  And, you know, not like in a New York post page six kind of way, but it was, [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7081.56s)]
*  you know, that he was the one person he did the tonight show and he moved to LA [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7086.24s)]
*  and he kind of left Lauren out of it, which has been atypical for everybody [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7089.400000000001s)]
*  who's passed through the universe. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7093.76s)]
*  And it seems, it seemed a little chilly. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7095.4400000000005s)]
*  Could you feel that when you were reporting it? [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7098.8s)]
*  I did feel that. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7101.04s)]
*  And I thought there was so much regret surrounding it. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7102.04s)]
*  And I mean, I wanted to say on both sides. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7105.92s)]
*  I think so. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7109.0s)]
*  I think it was, I think there was real pain. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7109.88s)]
*  I mean, Conan is always the first to say that if Lauren Michaels hadn't looked at [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7112.88s)]
*  him at one point and said, you, you know, he would never have had this. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7117.4s)]
*  And think about it. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7121.8s)]
*  Conan wasn't even a performer. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7122.96s)]
*  You know, he was a writer to get a writer like this and give him this huge platform. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7124.92s)]
*  And the thing that's so sort of sweet about it is, you know, I think there was a sort [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7129.679999999999s)]
*  of a bit of a road not taken aspect of that for Lauren, because he started out as a [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7134.44s)]
*  comedy writer who maybe wanted to perform, but, you know, and Lauren exalts writers. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7138.679999999999s)]
*  So it became a really fun performer on the show in his own weird way, which you [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7144.16s)]
*  covered nicely. He became a character somehow. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7148.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7151.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, I think the Lauren character is this big a character as church lady. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7151.88s)]
*  So, so yeah, he gave the keys to the kingdom to Conan. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7155.839999999999s)]
*  And I think Conan, you know, I think it's, it's, it's most people in the business [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7159.4s)]
*  feel that Conan and his camp made a tactical error when they did not insist that [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7166.44s)]
*  Lauren be made executive producer of the Tonight Show. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7173.12s)]
*  Well, but they also broke the rule where he found out from somebody else, not them, [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7176.2s)]
*  which seems like the one way to really cross Lauren. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7180.4s)]
*  And I know those guys. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7183.4s)]
*  I know, you know, went to college with Conan and I know Jeff Ross manager. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7184.64s)]
*  And I do think they have some regret about it. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7188.56s)]
*  They were very young. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7192.120000000001s)]
*  They were very caught up in it. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7193.360000000001s)]
*  These big shots at NBC were saying to them, no, no, no, you don't need Lauren [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7195.280000000001s)]
*  Michaels. You don't, you know, [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7198.68s)]
*  Yeah, you're going to do it in LA. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7199.72s)]
*  You don't need Lauren. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7200.84s)]
*  He's in New York. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7201.6s)]
*  It was this activist NBC management at that time who didn't really, you know, they [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7202.280000000001s)]
*  kind of wanted to elbow Lauren off the stage. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7206.4800000000005s)]
*  So, but, but as Jeff told me, and I, and I quote him in the book saying, you know [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7209.160000000001s)]
*  what? We didn't jump in front of the truck for Lauren. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7213.4s)]
*  So why should Lauren have jumped in front of the truck for us? [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7216.24s)]
*  And Lauren would never have admitted like, you know, [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7219.44s)]
*  having his feelings hurt or that they should have done it differently. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7222.759999999999s)]
*  But everyone in his camp feels like it was a faux pas. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7225.48s)]
*  Well, and I said this at the time when all that was happening, cause we were doing [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7229.799999999999s)]
*  podcasts about it. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7232.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7233.799999999999s)]
*  I just don't think what happens to Conan happens if Lauren's involved. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7235.719999999999s)]
*  He was too powerful and he meant too much to NBC. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7238.799999999999s)]
*  And if like the whole Leno that it just wouldn't happen. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7241.08s)]
*  I think, I think it's protected. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7244.92s)]
*  But the thing, the kind of beautiful thing at this point is, you know, Conan is [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7248.04s)]
*  now king of the world, king of podcasts. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7252.68s)]
*  You know, he's just doing so great. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7254.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm so happy that Conan has landed where he has. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7256.04s)]
*  And he and Lauren are in very, very good terms. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7258.76s)]
*  You know, it was great to see Conan at the anniversary show. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7261.12s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of real, real honest ongoing affection between the [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7265.5599999999995s)]
*  two of them. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7271.04s)]
*  Couple other things that I loved when he brought Rob Lohan for Wayne's world. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7272.24s)]
*  He likes to hire people who've just had a flop because they work twice as hard. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7277.2s)]
*  Like who else would think like that? [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7281.6s)]
*  Absolutely right. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7283.16s)]
*  It's true. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7284.44s)]
*  Who would have thought of that? [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7284.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7285.84s)]
*  No, because that was right after the sex tape. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7287.36s)]
*  You know, Rob Lohan was in disgrace. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7289.32s)]
*  Conan said about Lauren, a lot of people, myself, this is to you, a lot of people, [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7291.92s)]
*  myself included, think that Lauren has a secret and Lauren has made a career out [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7297.24s)]
*  of letting people think he has a secret. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7300.8s)]
*  I think Lauren's real secret was to communicate to me, you have to figure [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7303.16s)]
*  out the show he's basically saying. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7306.8s)]
*  I actually don't think Lauren has the secret, but, but he he'll have like a [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7309.8s)]
*  really good thought starter that you can then take and run with it. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7313.52s)]
*  That's how I interpreted that. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7317.4800000000005s)]
*  Right. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7318.6s)]
*  I think so too, but I think also it's, it's that Lauren has unconsciously or not [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7319.56s)]
*  cultivated this mystery and power that makes everybody want his good opinion. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7325.28s)]
*  Want to do good work for him. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7330.679999999999s)]
*  You know, it's. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7332.719999999999s)]
*  And, and, and, and that is the secret. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7335.679999999999s)]
*  It's this, this power that he holds over these people. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7337.919999999999s)]
*  So they just trust his take on if he's really passionate about one [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7341.32s)]
*  thing, they'll trust them. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7345.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7347.16s)]
*  I mean, John Ham told me that there isn't a day that goes by where he [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7347.5199999999995s)]
*  doesn't think what would Lauren do? [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7351.639999999999s)]
*  You know, and he curbs the impulse to pick up the phone and call Lauren and ask [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7353.96s)]
*  him, you know, over when it's really important. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7357.679999999999s)]
*  But a lot of these people live their lives that way. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7359.72s)]
*  You had a lot in the book about the imitation game with Lauren, which has [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7362.84s)]
*  started like, God only knows since the seventies and, um, and how aware Lauren [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7367.12s)]
*  is of it and how many different iterations they were and all of these different, [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7372.16s)]
*  you know, the writers would have their thing and then Bill Hayter would have his [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7376.16s)]
*  thing and it would just go on and Carvey and all that stuff. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7379.04s)]
*  And Lauren would just seems like he's fine with it, right? [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7382.2s)]
*  Cause you make fun of the boss. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7384.400000000001s)]
*  That's what happens. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7385.76s)]
*  Well, one of the funny things Lauren said about it to me, he goes, he said, yeah, [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7386.76s)]
*  you know, it's the most American thing there is making fun of the boss. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7390.56s)]
*  And then he said, of course they don't really do it much in Canada because [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7393.280000000001s)]
*  nobody's that successful there. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7396.320000000001s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, it, see that is consistent with another one of his many theorems, [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7401.0s)]
*  which is the 12, no, the infinite monkey theorem, which is how he views, uh, the [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7406.04s)]
*  essence of comedy writing. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7412.320000000001s)]
*  It's that old joke about, you know, you put a thousand monkeys in a room with a [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7413.56s)]
*  bunch of typewriters and eventually one of them will write Hamlet. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7417.4400000000005s)]
*  But there was a sixties comic named Stanley Myron Handelman who changed that [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7421.04s)]
*  joke to say, put the monkeys in the room with the typewriters. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7424.76s)]
*  I went back and a couple hours later and they were just fooling around. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7427.72s)]
*  And Lauren thinks that there's this incredible wisdom in that, that that's [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7431.76s)]
*  what you do with comedy writers. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7436.76s)]
*  That's why you have them writing all night long when their defenses are down, [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7438.320000000001s)]
*  when they're drunk, their guard is down, you know, fatigue is your friend. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7443.0s)]
*  He'll say, and because you want them to be at their goofiest, you don't want to [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7447.2s)]
*  be too self-conscious when you're writing comedy, you want to really, it's like [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7451.72s)]
*  pure id, I guess. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7456.36s)]
*  And, and I think he recognizes that all that time they spend making fun of him. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7457.56s)]
*  It's like lubrication for comedy, you know, loosens them up. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7463.56s)]
*  And, and Paula Pell even said, it kind of helps you deal with the fear, you know, [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7467.08s)]
*  the fear of Lauren and the fear that you're not going to get on the air. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7471.5199999999995s)]
*  It makes you just sort of loosen up. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7474.48s)]
*  And again, he's a smart enough manager of people to know that if that works for [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7476.88s)]
*  them, fine, you know, and he also told me, and I wish I had kind of pushed harder [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7482.24s)]
*  on this, he said that he does this too, that he's a really good mimic of the [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7487.16s)]
*  people at the show and he just does it at home, but never really. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7491.839999999999s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7495.32s)]
*  Like just the family members? [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7495.88s)]
*  I guess that's volume two. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7497.639999999999s)]
*  When do you think he realized that he was just going to be on the show and this was [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7500.68s)]
*  it, like what year it was somewhere between probably late eighties, early [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7504.360000000001s)]
*  nineties, where he just, all right, this is my life. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7508.2s)]
*  This is what I think of real turning points came after nine 11, you know, [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7510.16s)]
*  cause the whole nineties, the mid nineties were a terrible time for him with almost [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7515.88s)]
*  getting fired by Don Allmeyer. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7520.16s)]
*  And then the show picked up steam with all the great, you know, political debate [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7521.68s)]
*  stuff that Tim Downey wrote and everything. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7526.64s)]
*  And then nine 11, it was, it, it was the moment that I think the show emerged as [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7529.160000000001s)]
*  a kind of an important American institution. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7536.400000000001s)]
*  And a New York institution too, like simultaneously, right? [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7539.160000000001s)]
*  It brought it back to its roots. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7542.4400000000005s)]
*  This was a, you know, it was the first time in my life that America seemed to [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7544.0s)]
*  like New York, right? [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7548.76s)]
*  And New York suddenly was. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7550.76s)]
*  Even me, I hate New York. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7551.72s)]
*  And even that, I remember rooting for the Yankees in the playoffs, hoping [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7553.52s)]
*  they'd get one for the city. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7556.84s)]
*  So, you know, the way he, he conceived of that moment with the firefighters and [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7558.4400000000005s)]
*  mayor Giuliani, pretty disgrace, you know, and had Paul Simon sing that song. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7564.88s)]
*  Like he just had this producers. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7571.28s)]
*  Knack for navigating that moment, doing something that was so beautiful and [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7574.0s)]
*  profound and also funny, you know, I mean, as, as he says in the latter part of my [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7580.4s)]
*  book, when he's talking about doing the COVID show and, you know, you just always [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7586.48s)]
*  have to, the show has to show up and you have to demonstrate, remind viewers that [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7591.2s)]
*  there's a decency to the show. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7595.2s)]
*  And I think that it was that moment that the show and Lauren himself just kind of [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7597.32s)]
*  were, you know, it was kind of a hall of fame moment. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7601.919999999999s)]
*  They weren't going anywhere. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7604.36s)]
*  He's never really been under threat since then. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7606.08s)]
*  It's interesting. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7609.04s)]
*  Cause when they missed the moment, which I think, and you wrote in the book, the [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7609.5599999999995s)]
*  after Trump got elected when the way they started the show, it just didn't work. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7613.12s)]
*  I didn't think it worked in the moment. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7616.56s)]
*  I think people behind the scenes didn't feel like it worked. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7617.92s)]
*  And now I don't think anybody looks back and thinks, Oh, what a great moment. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7621.08s)]
*  Told me, Oh, I love Kate McKinnon singing that song. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7624.92s)]
*  But I mean, I thought it was kind of wet. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7627.8s)]
*  You know, I thought, just, just didn't work. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7630.28s)]
*  Some people liked it. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7632.96s)]
*  Um, but again, I thought the reason I thought that was interesting is because it [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7634.08s)]
*  showed how fine the calibrated his ability to kind of deal with the sort of [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7638.44s)]
*  millennial sensibilities on his staff are. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7644.639999999999s)]
*  You know, he knew he had to give them something. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7647.48s)]
*  They wanted to do this. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7649.879999999999s)]
*  He didn't like it, but he let them have it. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7651.12s)]
*  And it like, it reminded me of a funny anecdote that I love in the book is I'm [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7653.24s)]
*  walking with him through the theater district. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7657.48s)]
*  We passed the mean girls marquee. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7660.599999999999s)]
*  That's the show he produced with Tina Fey. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7662.32s)]
*  And he was disappointed because, um, his friend Margaret Trudeau was in town and [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7665.08s)]
*  he got her tickets for that night. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7669.240000000001s)]
*  And he was angry because the lead actress had called in sick that day because she [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7671.360000000001s)]
*  took her dog had eaten glue and she had to take the dog to the vet. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7676.280000000001s)]
*  So she wasn't going to be in the show. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7679.4800000000005s)]
*  And Lauren just shook his head and he said, if it was Patty Lepone's dog, it [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7681.72s)]
*  would be dead, you know, the idea that, you know, cause he's a real showbiz guy. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7686.08s)]
*  The show must go on. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7691.64s)]
*  And the fact that his friend Mark Richard Crudeau was going to have to [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7693.16s)]
*  see an understudy, I don't like that. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7695.84s)]
*  Couple other things you were talking about in beats when she came back for [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7699.92s)]
*  the, uh, anniversary show and he's kind of saying like, Oh, her career didn't [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7702.8s)]
*  kind of go the way maybe she thought it was going to go. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7708.28s)]
*  And he said, um, you were like so many others who started the show beats. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7710.24s)]
*  Michael said, didn't understand heat. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7714.92s)]
*  They didn't understand that you're hot for about two or three years. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7717.12s)]
*  And if nothing else happens, you go to the back of the line again, [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7719.56s)]
*  which it seems like he was painfully aware of with himself too. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7722.679999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7726.2s)]
*  That's just what, yeah. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7726.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, he learned that after the first five years. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7727.799999999999s)]
*  And so again, he's just like this guy. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7730.08s)]
*  He's got this lesson book that he, and he remembers, think about the rest of us. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7733.0s)]
*  And so many people we know, we repeat our mistakes. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7738.2s)]
*  We do the same thing over and over. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7741.28s)]
*  He doesn't, he somehow learns from his mistakes. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7742.5599999999995s)]
*  What's the most fair criticism you heard from him, from the people who were [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7745.44s)]
*  interviewing that was like a recurring criticism of him. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7749.12s)]
*  About him. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7752.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7752.56s)]
*  Gee, let me think. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7754.96s)]
*  Um, you know, I think that there are people who just feel that sometimes [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7755.92s)]
*  his, his aloofness can actually be cruel and cold. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7763.28s)]
*  Um, you know, there are definitely people who feel that way. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7769.16s)]
*  There's same number of people who say like, Oh, you know, when my wife got sick, [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7772.44s)]
*  he called and fixed the insurance and, you know, so it's, it's both. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7776.16s)]
*  Right. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7779.12s)]
*  He paid for funerals. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7779.24s)]
*  He paid for Michael McDonald. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7780.4s)]
*  With Donahue's funeral, even though, oh, Donahue, even though, uh, he didn't like him. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7781.88s)]
*  But I do think that that sort of icy management thing, which you, you know, [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7786.64s)]
*  there's the book deals in it. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7791.88s)]
*  I think mostly that kind of peaked in the nineties. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7793.64s)]
*  Um, you know, you have Bob Odenkirk moaning about how, why the hell is this [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7796.360000000001s)]
*  guy in charge and everything, but at the same time, you know, Odenkirk and [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7800.92s)]
*  Lauren are now good friends. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7804.200000000001s)]
*  I mean, what there's a lot of in Lauren's life, it's, you know, the way people, you [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7805.200000000001s)]
*  know, in 12 step programs and like make amends, you know, Lauren gets a lot of [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7810.32s)]
*  letters from people 30 years later saying, I can't believe I was such a jerk [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7813.96s)]
*  when I worked for you. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7818.24s)]
*  Now I know how hard your job is because I've had to, you know, be a director or [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7819.4s)]
*  manage people or. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7823.32s)]
*  Well, you're dealing with the ambitious people in their twenties and thirties. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7824.24s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure I look back at some of the stuff I did like way back when I'm [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7827.32s)]
*  like, God damn it, why did I do that? [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7831.0s)]
*  Um, and I'm sure they have a lot of those moments, especially a pressure cooker [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7833.2s)]
*  where it's hunger games every week. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7836.5599999999995s)]
*  Everyone's pitted against each other. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7838.24s)]
*  He said, um, you have this near the end. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7840.120000000001s)]
*  You can't spend the last half of your life watching the first half of your life, [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7843.84s)]
*  which is how he felt about nostalgia. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7847.8s)]
*  Is that one of the reasons he's still working at age 80? [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7849.76s)]
*  I think that's true. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7852.92s)]
*  He doesn't, I mean, he, I think these anniversary shows mean a lot to him, but [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7854.200000000001s)]
*  he isn't on a nostalgia trip. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7858.320000000001s)]
*  You know, he is really in the moment. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7860.280000000001s)]
*  Uh, he's never like, Oh, those were the days. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7863.120000000001s)]
*  It was better than he's. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7865.72s)]
*  You know, I think he probably thinks that the utility of all the fanfare over [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7867.72s)]
*  the 50th is to get more, read, get more viewers for the 51st and 52nd season. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7874.24s)]
*  He's always charging ahead. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7879.84s)]
*  He's thinking about the next cast. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7881.4s)]
*  Uh, earlier this season, you know, I was talking to him about how this [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7883.6s)]
*  current cast is really big. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7887.72s)]
*  It's a big cast again. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7889.4800000000005s)]
*  And he said something like, yeah, well, you know, it always takes like two or [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7891.4400000000005s)]
*  three years for the kind of new cast to sort of settle. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7894.04s)]
*  And it just struck me that as he's about to settle 50th, he's thinking about, [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7896.6s)]
*  he's thinking ahead, he's thinking about making the cast work. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7900.64s)]
*  And I think that's part of the secret of it. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7904.16s)]
*  You know, he doesn't, he doesn't look back. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7906.88s)]
*  And again, why it was all the more special that when I talked to him right [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7909.36s)]
*  after the 40th, he was in the sort of rare sweet spot of thinking about the [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7914.04s)]
*  past and the future and his legacy. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7919.48s)]
*  And I mean, I think there's a lot of warmth in him, uh, that, that he's, [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7921.16s)]
*  he's letting come to the surface a little bit more now. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7926.12s)]
*  And that is kind of lovely. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7929.8s)]
*  Well, the biggest thing that's helped him is that there's hasn't been a kick [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7931.92s)]
*  ass threat competitor to come in. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7936.76s)]
*  I always thought Netflix, I just can't believe Netflix hasn't challenged him [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7939.4s)]
*  yet, but I think it's cause Sarandos loves the show so much. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7943.16s)]
*  He just doesn't want to challenge the show. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7946.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7947.68s)]
*  Sarandos is one of those guys who sends him a father's day greeting, you [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7947.92s)]
*  know, but it will be interesting to see, right? [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7951.0s)]
*  Sarandos is behind this new, you know, Netflix's first foray into late night [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7953.68s)]
*  television with the John Mulaney show coming. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7959.52s)]
*  Well, and that in comedy too, they're like, you know, they have this [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7961.48s)]
*  old Netflix is a joke week out here. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7964.72s)]
*  And the one thing that's missing is like an SNL type show, but I just [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7966.4s)]
*  don't think they're doing it until Lauren leaves. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7969.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7971.88s)]
*  I think, I think that's right. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7972.16s)]
*  I think at this point, there's so much, so many issues of respect and karma [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7973.36s)]
*  that nobody's going to try to, you know, nudge him off the stage that way. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7977.24s)]
*  Well, congrats on the book. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7981.0s)]
*  I had you for an hour. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7982.52s)]
*  I could have gone longer, but I thought it was so enjoyable because I'm so [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7983.4s)]
*  fascinated by him, but the management and perspective on success and loyalty [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7988.12s)]
*  and all that stuff, I just thought it was really cool. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7993.44s)]
*  I loved the way he laid it out and the behind the scenes stuff with that [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7995.44s)]
*  Joan Hill show was just awesome. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=7998.76s)]
*  Like as a diehard SNL person, like I just, I thought it was so interesting. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=8000.12s)]
*  Well, and once I got to really know all those personalities, just to see, you [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=8004.6s)]
*  know, somebody Larry, I just did Lawrence and Donald show and he said, it was [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=8009.5199999999995s)]
*  sort of like the office, you know, like a workplace comedy. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=8013.0s)]
*  I mean, just seeing like the way he would manipulate Colin Jones this way [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=8015.4s)]
*  and the way he would get Jonah Hill to not to shut up and the way it's really [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=8019.28s)]
*  interesting to watch. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tok0yQqRYxw&t=8024.759999999999s)]
