# The Russell Westbrookâ€“James Harden Venn Diagram | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [October 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojz6FAayb0U)
*  Alright, I wanted to talk about James Harden and Russell Westbrook.
*  Two guys who grew up together in Oklahoma City.
*  Westbrook was the 08 draft and Harden was the 09 draft.
*  They played on that Thunder team that made the finals in 2012.
*  Harden got famously traded right after that.
*  It's not a rivalry.
*  It's not a feud.
*  And yet, they've been linked together for the last 15 years in the strangest possible ways.
*  Now they're about to be linked together.
*  It seems like the Clippers are going to be the salvation trade for the Sixers.
*  The Athletic had all these reports today about they almost traded for them this summer.
*  They actually offered an unprotected first, which I hadn't heard before.
*  And it just seems like maybe that's eventually where Harden goes.
*  What's interesting is Westbrook is already there.
*  And you could argue that Westbrook makes more sense for the Clippers than Harden does.
*  But then this goes back to the whole Westbrook versus Harden thing.
*  You know, there's different kinds of players that get linked.
*  So you have like the Eternal players, where it's Russell and Will.
*  They're just linked together.
*  They're always going to be together.
*  Bird of Magic, Shaq and Kobe, Elgin and Jerry, Wade and LeBron.
*  Those guys, they just kind of go hand in hand.
*  You get a specific era or it's a rivalry or they're teammates, whatever it is.
*  Then there's the ones that always get thrown together because
*  they get compared to each other the whole career.
*  I feel like Duncan and Dirk were like this.
*  Isaiah and Magic, even though Magic was the one that kind of won the war for years and years,
*  that was a real argument.
*  Who would you rather have?
*  KD and LeBron got there in the mid-2010s for a few years.
*  Malone and Barkley is my favorite.
*  I did a whole when I wrote my basketball book.
*  I did a Dr. Jack breakdown.
*  The ones where during the duration of their careers,
*  you couldn't help but compare them against each other.
*  Then there's a spinoff of that where that was the case for a little while.
*  Then there was an eventual winner.
*  Like Hakeem and Robinson, those guys got compared to each other a lot.
*  Then Hakeem just ascended over him.
*  Same for Larry Bird and Dr. J.
*  I feel like Jerry West got the best of Oscar Robertson eventually.
*  We saw it this year with Yo Kitchen and Bead.
*  Curry and Chris Paul.
*  There was a stretch there where it's like,
*  oh, Chris Paul, he's the alpha.
*  And then Curry just passed him.
*  Harden and Russ, I don't know really who had the upper hand on who.
*  I had when I did my pyramid, I did another pass at it this summer.
*  And I had Westbrook as the 63rd best player of all time.
*  I had Harden as the 43rd best player of all time.
*  So Harden wins in the pyramid.
*  And Harden, I think, had a higher end career.
*  He had six first teams.
*  One second team, OMBA, one third team.
*  He won an MVP.
*  Six top five finishes.
*  Westbrook also won an MVP.
*  Two first teams, five second teams.
*  So Harden, slightly better career.
*  Then you go into the stats and it gets a little closer.
*  Russ was basically a 22, 7, and 8 guy.
*  44% shooting, not as good 3-point shooting as Harden.
*  15 seasons, almost 1,100 games.
*  But in the playoffs, stats go up.
*  He played 116 playoff games so far.
*  25, 7, and 8.
*  41% shooting.
*  His playoff resume made the 2012 finals.
*  He was the second best player.
*  2011 Western Finals, 2014 and 16 Western Finals.
*  He won two points per game scoring titles and then three assist titles.
*  And most famously, had brought the triple double back.
*  He averaged the triple double for four straight seasons.
*  As you know, I don't care about triple doubles.
*  But it was cool.
*  Nobody had done it since Oscar.
*  Harden, 25, 7, and 6 for his career.
*  Better statistically, 44, 36, 83 percentages.
*  14 seasons, 1,000 games.
*  Both of them are super durable.
*  In the playoffs, it drops.
*  He's down to 23, 5, and 6.
*  The field goal percentage is down to 42%.
*  And then from an MVP standpoint, six top five finishes.
*  Playoff resumes about the same.
*  They both made the 2012 finals and the 2011 Western Conference Finals.
*  Harden is the best player.
*  Made the Western Finals in 15 and 18.
*  You could argue in 18, he came closer to winning a title
*  than he had at any other point in his career other than the 2012 finals.
*  You could say the same for Westbrook.
*  If Klay Thompson doesn't get hot in the 2016 Western Finals,
*  maybe they beat Cleveland in the finals.
*  So both of them have a little what if thing.
*  And then his version of the triple double seasons,
*  he had that crazy run.
*  He averaged 36.1 points a game for an entire season,
*  which was the highest in Spanklejura.
*  And then he also had the 34.3.
*  So it's weird.
*  They're closer than I thought, you know?
*  And then you go like, all right, what characteristics do they have in common?
*  Well, they both started with OKC.
*  Both super durable.
*  Both high usage guys, for better and worse.
*  They always succeeded the most when the ball revolved around them the most.
*  Wasn't necessarily great for the team.
*  And they always had to find players to put around them
*  that made them succeed sometimes at the expense of the team.
*  The stats were pretty similar, as we just covered.
*  They both played for four teams.
*  Westbrook's on five.
*  Harden's about to be on five.
*  They're both 34 years old.
*  They're both super polarizing.
*  I think these are probably, other than Dwight Howard,
*  the two of the three most polarizing guys of the last 20 years.
*  And there's been a lot of arguments and a lot of debates about
*  could you actually win a title if this was your best guy or your second best guy?
*  And I remember I wrote a column about Westbrook back in 2012
*  during the finals called That Boy Competed.
*  And it was about how great Westbrook was despite this obvious flaw that he had,
*  that he was just kind of out of control sometimes.
*  And sometimes at the worst possible times,
*  like in the finals game after I wrote that column,
*  and that was when I came up with the idea of the 90-10 guy.
*  The guy who's 90% perfect,
*  but there's that 10% that drives you crazy.
*  And with some guys, it stands out more than others.
*  And with Westbrook, his 10% was the most glaring,
*  flashing horns 10% you've ever seen in your life.
*  And that's what we used to argue about with him.
*  Both of them were really disappointing in the playoffs.
*  Like, let's be honest.
*  If you talk about what are the great Westbrook playoff moments,
*  you'd have some trouble.
*  Especially after Durant left, really nothing happened with him in the playoffs.
*  2016, he wasn't great.
*  2014, he really laid it to Chris Paul in the Quipper series.
*  That was probably his personal highlight for that.
*  But then Harden, I mean, Zach Lowe called him the Carl Malone of the playoffs,
*  or the Carl Malone of guards.
*  Zach Lowe said that on my Book of Basketball podcast, I think four years ago.
*  And it was like two terrible Harden playoff performances ago.
*  He goes down as this century's worst postseason performer.
*  Brasilla was on my podcast Sunday and said he should be in the Quitter Hall of Fame.
*  So that's where we stand on Harden.
*  They both won MVPs.
*  They're both really flawed in the sense of you're a superstar.
*  You shouldn't have flaws that are as glaring as the flaws that these guys have.
*  Harden's case, you know, doesn't play defense,
*  disappears at the worst possible times.
*  Westbrook, it's the 10% thing that we mentioned.
*  The same thing that makes Westbrook great is also the thing that terrifies you the most in a big game
*  because he thinks he's the best player in the world at all times.
*  So with 50 seconds left, all of a sudden he's taking a three or driving the basket.
*  This is why he didn't work with the Lakers.
*  They also have like an extra skill beyond what you think their skill is.
*  Like Harden is a phenomenal passer when he wants to be.
*  Westbrook is one of the best rebounding guards of all time.
*  He really is.
*  He's a phenomenal rebounder.
*  And it was something that Quippers tapped into in the playoffs last year.
*  He's, you know, he's in his mid thirties and he's still still had that quality.
*  Both of them weirdly belong to a city.
*  I still feel like Oklahoma City loves Russ.
*  I still feel like Houston loves Harden, even if the Rockets organization didn't want them to come back.
*  They both broke up with KD and they're both one of a kind.
*  I've never seen a player like either of them.
*  I have never seen anyone like Westbrook.
*  There was a moment when it was like him and Derrick Rose.
*  They were aligned just as these uber athletic kind of mini LeBron point guards.
*  And we just didn't see anybody before with speed athleticism like that.
*  And Rose immediately broke down.
*  Westbrook's still going.
*  He's starting for the Quippers.
*  So, you know, you think about like the big, big, big flaws that I mentioned earlier.
*  Like Russ was the ball dominance and the usage rate stuff.
*  He's the second highest usage rate guy of all time.
*  Like literally of all time.
*  He's number two of anyone who's ever played basketball.
*  He has the highest usage rate.
*  The statistically like the field goal percentage.
*  There's a bunch of ways to ding them.
*  True shooting percentage, ton of turnovers.
*  And the end of game stuff isn't great.
*  Harden's a little different.
*  Like he quit on three teams.
*  This is the new record.
*  I mean, this is like he's like DiMaggio's 56 game hitting streak.
*  We're never going to see this again.
*  The defense we mentioned, the high usage very similar to Westbrook.
*  He's 11th all time.
*  Um, Westbrook second Westbrook, uh, is I think 32% usage rate and Harden was at 30.
*  And the playoff flame outs, you know, those are what they are.
*  But you think back to 2009, they're both on the same team and Harden at that point.
*  It looks like he has a chance to be okay.
*  Seize Janobli.
*  That seems like the best case scenario.
*  Those three years belong to Russ all the way through the 2012 finals.
*  And if you're, if you're going like advantage Harden advantage Russ back and forth, who's
*  winning Russ wins those first four years, but he was a year older.
*  Harden gets traded to okay.
*  See Harden basically takes over at least for 2013 and 2014 and probably 2015 from Russ.
*  Um, and that was when Harden brought Houston to the 2015 Western finals,
*  although they should have lost to the Clippers and they yanked him and he put the towel over
*  his head and it was maybe not even a top three James Harden winning performance,
*  but, uh, Corey, Corey Brewer, Josh Smith, say disaster, Trevor Riza,
*  then advantage back to Russ for the 2015 16 season.
*  And then the next season when he wins the MVP, then it swings back to Harden and Harden puts
*  together, um, two awesome years, he culminating in where you could argue if Chris Paul doesn't
*  get hurt against the warriors.
*  Maybe they win the title that year.
*  I don't know.
*  It still remains to be seen whether you can win four straight playoff rounds with that ball
*  dominant, uh, Luca Harden type of style.
*  Oh, I'll believe it when I see it.
*  Then they play together in 2019, 20 that season, um, which was turned out to be the bubble
*  season, but there was a really fun stretch there where they just basically dumped the
*  center position, spread the floor and just attacked the basket with Harden and Westbrook.
*  So I'm giving them a draw because that was really fun.
*  Then all of a sudden in the, in the playoffs, it fell apart.
*  Um, 20 to 22, probably Harden because Westbrook's career starts going sideways.
*  And that goes until last season, which at that point, Harden was playing really well
*  for Philly.
*  Westbrook's career looked like it was over on the Lakers.
*  You know, he's, he's a complete pariah.
*  We write him off.
*  LeBron throws them under the bus.
*  LeBron was the one that traded for him.
*  And then LeBron was the one trying to trade him.
*  Russ took it very personally as he probably should have and has the unhappiest four or
*  five months there.
*  And it really seems like his career is going to be over then finds the fountain youth with
*  the Clippers.
*  And now he has the advantage again in this bizarre.
*  It's not a rivalry.
*  It's not a feud.
*  It's just these two cars driving next to each other on the highway.
*  But Russ is in the driver's seat.
*  He's the one that's on the Clippers.
*  He was smart enough to take less money to be in a good situation.
*  Harden was the one who opted in to 35 million and then said, I'm unhappy.
*  I'm never reported in this organization.
*  You opted in buddy.
*  But now he wants to get traded the Clippers.
*  And the way this might play out is either they're going to play together on their third
*  team in the past, in the, in the last, I guess, 12 years, dated back to 2012.
*  There would be three different cities together, which is crazy.
*  Or Westbrook is going to be the reason that they don't trade for Harden.
*  And if you, you know, if you're going to talk about who has the advantage again, I had
*  the Harden higher in the pyramid, but Russ, other than his Lakers situation, even then,
*  like a lot of the quotes from the Lakers were what an awesome teammate he was.
*  He knows he's in the worst situation ever.
*  Everybody loves Russ as a teammate.
*  And I think that has to matter if you're comparing the players like the Harden thing.
*  You know, it's there's not 50 guys lined up being like, oh man,
*  James, wow, love playing with that guy.
*  It's a little more silent on that front.
*  The Westbrook thing, like there was a whole story how he bought all these iPhones for
*  the Clippers and he's been the leader of the team and he's been organized.
*  They need a leader cause Kawhi doesn't talk.
*  But he's really embraced even though he's, you know, on this $3.8 million contract,
*  he's about to hit 35 years old.
*  Looks like his career, this might be the last chance for him, but he's kind of embraced it.
*  And he's one of those guys that he's such an incredible athlete.
*  It maybe won't be surprising if he plays three, four more years.
*  I don't know if you can win two playoff rounds with him, but
*  him looking mostly like him seems realistic.
*  Harden on the other hand, looks like if it doesn't work out with the Clippers,
*  I don't know what happens to him.
*  So if you're comparing these two guys since 2009,
*  and you said Westbrook's still going to be in the league playing for a team and Harden isn't,
*  I think the odds even like three years ago would have been plus 700 on FanDuel.
*  And instead Westbrook, inexplicably is kind of in the driver's seat.
*  So what happens now?
*  Do the Clippers trade for Harden?
*  And if they trade for Harden, can these guys coexist again?
*  Because we watched it in the 2018-20 season.
*  They flamed out in the playoffs.
*  Then Harden, that was when he got super unhappy.
*  It was Russ a piece of that.
*  I don't know.
*  Are they still friends?
*  I don't know.
*  They don't really make sense together as basketball players because of the usage rate thing.
*  In general, I would run from James Harden.
*  That's it.
*  If you've quit on three teams, I don't care how talented you are.
*  I want no part of you.
*  But if you're the Clippers and you have this new arena next year,
*  you're just throwing shit against the wall and you don't care about your
*  2029 unprotected pick and maybe you don't even care if you give up Norman Powell,
*  you want to be interesting.
*  You don't want to be irrelevant.
*  The one thing you can't be with one year left on your old stadium before you move into this
*  palace that you just built at Inglewood is to be irrelevant.
*  So that's why they're going to end up probably trading for James Harden,
*  which I didn't even think was conceivable until this week.
*  And then we're back with this weird Westbrook-Harden situation.
*  Are they rivals?
*  Are they frenemies?
*  What are they?
*  I have no fucking clue, but I think Harden had a slightly better career.
*  And yet if I could have one guy over the course of 15 years,
*  and you gave me 15 years of James Harden or 15 years of Russell Westbrook,
*  I know, I know it makes more sense to take Harden and I know his ceiling was slightly higher.
*  But I think I'd take Westbrook.
*  And again, I had Harden 43rd in the pyramid and I had Westbrook 63rd.
*  But Westbrook always gave a shit.
*  And whether it was misguided, whether he held himself in too high of an esteem,
*  whether he was enabled with bad habits, I don't know.
*  But I always felt like if you're just going to say like,
*  who do you trust more over a 15 year span to just give a shit?
*  I would say Westbrook.
*  So it'd be ironic if the Clippers decided not to trade for James Harden
*  because they have Russell Westbrook.
*  And I think that would be maybe the final win in whatever the hell you call this.
*  This frenemy rivalry, team-matey, whatever it is.
*  Westbrook and Harden, there's been no parallel combination like this
*  in the history of the league.
*  I'm just telling you.
*  I wrote the book of basketball.
*  I should know.
