# Is the Criticism of Jayson Tatum Unfair? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ)
*  Chris Ryan asked if he could drink a beer during this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I said, yeah, cause it looks like the Eastern finals might end up sucking. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=2.06s)]
*  Uh, Halliburton leaves the game, same leg, same hamstring as before. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=6.18s)]
*  And, uh, CR, if you're the Pacers, you're up three inbound in the ball and game [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=11.14s)]
*  one, you're feeling awesome. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=16.6s)]
*  And then 48 hours later, you're down two games to nothing and your best player. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=18.68s)]
*  Seemingly has re-injured the same thing that knocked him out for a lot of the, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=24.26s)]
*  uh, middle of the season. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=27.580000000000002s)]
*  Thoughts. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=29.14s)]
*  Got him right where I want him. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=30.32s)]
*  If I'm with Carlisle, soften them up, make the J's think it's all over. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=31.68s)]
*  And then him. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=38.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=39.6s)]
*  The Celtics will never be more vulnerable to a flurry of Andrew [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  Nemhard eight foot jumpers. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=44.08s)]
*  Uh, I would feel pretty heartbroken. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=46.4s)]
*  You know, when I was, when, when we were getting into halftime and it just felt [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=48.56s)]
*  like the Celtics should be up by 22 points and I was like, man, they're not [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  dying. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=56.92s)]
*  Like they're just hanging out and see Ockham's having like this crazy breakout [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=57.32s)]
*  game and you know, maybe a little bit of Boston nerves creeping in just like last [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  time. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=67.08s)]
*  And yeah, between the barrage of threes, Tatum coming back to life and then the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=67.34s)]
*  Halliburton injury, you might, you, you, you don't want to say it's over, but it's [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=73.42s)]
*  over Rob. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=77.38s)]
*  It is over. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=78.48s)]
*  If, if Halliburton can't play, it is kind of that simple. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=79.76s)]
*  And look, there's trade-offs to that. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=82.48s)]
*  Tyrese Halliburton has been in a lot of ways, the Celtics easiest path to offense [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=84.28s)]
*  at times in the series, putting him in the action has been really good for them, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=88.16s)]
*  but the Pacers are not the same team without him. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=91.47999999999999s)]
*  And I thought Boston in particular, you know, they cranked up their defense. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  I thought overall in this game, we think of the Pacers as primarily a jump [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  shooting outfit, but they were, I think, second in the league in points in the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  paint this year, Boston dominated the points in the pain in this game. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=104.6s)]
*  It was a lot of dancing side to side all night for Indiana. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=108.44s)]
*  And it took a heroic effort from Pascal Siakam to keep them in the game. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=111.8s)]
*  And if you can't have your best player on top of an effort like that for any [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=116.2s)]
*  number of games in this series, I think that's going to be all she wrote. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  So they get Siakam. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  It's like Bruce Brown. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=125.12s)]
*  It's a crappy pick in this year's draft and a couple extra firsts. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=127.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=131.04s)]
*  I think two picks this year and then one, the 2026 Pacers pick, I believe. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=131.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=135.76s)]
*  And he's a free agent, but they're going to resign him. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=136.6s)]
*  Unless I don't know, Chris, we'll talk about Philly later, but [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=141.48s)]
*  Oh, good. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  I'm glad I had a purpose here. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=145.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=146.67999999999998s)]
*  Who's going to write the Siakam? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=147.07999999999998s)]
*  Could he go to Philly? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=148.84s)]
*  Question mark, question mark, question mark story. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=149.83999999999997s)]
*  Maybe that'll be in like two weeks. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  Um, but Siakam when we do the ringer 100, Rob, it's one of those guys you're [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=153.83999999999997s)]
*  making the list and you go, ah, yeah, he's one of the 50 best players in the league. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=160.72s)]
*  And it felt like a lot of teams could have gotten them. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=167.72s)]
*  You watch them today. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=169.88s)]
*  He's going toe to toe with Tatum and Brown and he's just, you know, he's a good player. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=170.72s)]
*  I do wonder like Zach Low wrote about this for ESPN about the Derek White trade and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=175.4s)]
*  the mechanics of that and the Josh Hart trade and these trades where it seems like [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=179.16s)]
*  people are overpaying for guys who aren't like the Donovan Mitchell, you know, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=184.88s)]
*  Rudy Gobert type massive trade. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=189.16s)]
*  And is this kind of the new inefficiency? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=191.6s)]
*  What'd you think of that thesis? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=193.68s)]
*  I mean, clearly those two guys in particular are culture setters. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=196.12s)]
*  They're not just great players, but they redefine a lot of the way your team [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=199.32s)]
*  operates and the energy and the spirit that they play with. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  I think the problem with that sort of philosophy as a league wide takeaway is [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=205.92s)]
*  there aren't a ton of those guys out there, right? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=211.12s)]
*  There are, there are very good role players, but guys who slot in and do their [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=213.16s)]
*  job and go to work and go home, there aren't a lot of Derek White's just sitting around. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=217.04s)]
*  And so I think that's what makes him so valuable. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=221.32s)]
*  And what makes him so valuable to the Celtics is these guys aren't just everywhere, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=223.48s)]
*  but when you can get them, they seem undervalued until they mean everything for your team. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=226.76s)]
*  Yeah. And I think the role players face the same fate as high end draft picks or all [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=231.76s)]
*  stars where it's like, it's an environmental thing. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=237.2s)]
*  I mean, like PJ Washington and Daniel Gafford, I would cut off my left hand to have [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=239.76s)]
*  either one of those guys playing on the Sixers, but I wouldn't have been able to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  tell you that at the trade deadline. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=247.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=248.56s)]
*  Because you need a backup center because your real center doesn't play that much. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=249.92s)]
*  Is that why you would sacrifice a hand? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=254.16s)]
*  That's, that's your free hit. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=256.0s)]
*  So that's one. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=257.48s)]
*  That's it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=258.36s)]
*  That's one. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=262.44s)]
*  And then Boston Chris is going to come out. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=264.2s)]
*  The, the PJ Washington thing, I still don't totally understand because I don't [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=271.12s)]
*  understand how you could watch a guy on a bad team where everybody's just going for [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=276.36s)]
*  their own stats basically for a few years and then just kind of instinctively know. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=280.24s)]
*  Even we're watching it in real time. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=285.0s)]
*  I didn't feel like he was that guy in February or March, April. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=286.68s)]
*  There were some signs. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=289.52s)]
*  Um, but Rob, did you see him becoming like this Robert Horry type potential got [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=291.28s)]
*  the fur a championship team? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=296.0s)]
*  What were the signs? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, there's clearly signs in skillset, right? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=299.56s)]
*  And we've been talking about those for years. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=301.84s)]
*  It's the reason why we've been talking through PJ Washington trades for season [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=303.28s)]
*  after season after season, what he can do is theoretically appealing to lots of [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=306.68s)]
*  teams, but it still seemed pretty theoretical to me until we saw it in [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=310.56s)]
*  Dallas and Gafford is a similar exercise, except as an energy big, instead of a [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=314.84s)]
*  stretch big, it is hard to read guys in those situations in theory, you know, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=318.52s)]
*  teams are doing background. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=323.35999999999996s)]
*  They're trying to talk to everyone that they can to get information on what these [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=324.64s)]
*  guys' actual work habits are. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=328.08s)]
*  But realistically, I, I still think it's a bit of a, a bit of a crap shoot. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=330.0s)]
*  As far as that goes, you're going to strike out with some of those players you [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=334.12s)]
*  try to acquire and you're going to hit the jackpot with your PJ Washington too. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=337.16s)]
*  I think what Dallas did well is they did identify guys who could play with [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=341.36s)]
*  Luca and Kyrie very, very well. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=344.76000000000005s)]
*  And who don't necessarily need the ball on a really consistent basis to be able [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=347.04s)]
*  to summon lots of energy and play with a lot of energy. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=351.48s)]
*  So that's something you can pick out on tape as to whether it's going to be a [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=354.16s)]
*  perfect kind of cultural fit every single time. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I'm, I'm as lost as anybody. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=360.76000000000005s)]
*  See Chris's team doesn't think this way because they're all about three all [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=363.0s)]
*  stars. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=367.04s)]
*  Who's the third? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=369.12s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=370.52000000000004s)]
*  It's Paul George. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=371.88s)]
*  She's dying to leave Los Angeles. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=372.8s)]
*  We'll talk about that later. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=374.32s)]
*  Um, can we talk, see how you're a narrative guy? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=375.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=378.88s)]
*  We've talked narratives a few times. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=379.36s)]
*  I'm a narrative guy, but I'm just don't, don't skip me when it comes to the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=381.16s)]
*  legacy, cause I'm also a legacy. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=384.52000000000004s)]
*  You're a legacy and a narrative guy. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=386.04s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=387.72s)]
*  Um, people are bored already with this Boston Indiana series. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=388.88s)]
*  So Boston wins game one and it still turns into a two day Tatum referendum. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=393.2s)]
*  And I know from a Celtics organization, all the way up standpoint, they're really [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=398.76s)]
*  frustrated with the Tatum coverage, you know, for the sense he's 26 years old. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=404.28s)]
*  He scored more playoff points than any player in his first seven years ever. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=409.91999999999996s)]
*  He's made three first team on BAS. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=413.24s)]
*  He made first all team NBA this year as an all around guy. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=415.03999999999996s)]
*  He's been really impactful and has gotten better at that year after year. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=418.44s)]
*  And if there's a nitpick, it's something I've talked about over and over again, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=423.47999999999996s)]
*  which is that his three point shooting just hasn't been good enough. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=426.4s)]
*  And I think I saw, I looked up his game log, his last 14 games before tonight. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=428.96s)]
*  He was 24% in the playoffs from three tonight. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=434.8s)]
*  He was one for seven, but he's carrying himself. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=437.84s)]
*  Like he's this 40 plus percent three point shooter. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=440.8s)]
*  So you're nitpicking on that. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=443.15999999999997s)]
*  Great. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=444.28s)]
*  But the all around game is really good. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=445.15999999999997s)]
*  Is he Luca? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=448.36s)]
*  Is he Janice? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=449.03999999999996s)]
*  Is he, is he, uh, he's not, he's not. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=449.88s)]
*  Is he LeBron in 2013? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=452.76s)]
*  He's not. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=455.12s)]
*  But is he in the vicinity of where Kevin Durant was on those OKC teams? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=456.32s)]
*  He is. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=461.35999999999996s)]
*  Maybe he's not as good as Durant was, but in terms of being an impactful forward, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=461.96s)]
*  I don't ever have this spiritual experience watching Jason Tatum that I did watching Kevin Durant. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=466.47999999999996s)]
*  And that aside from the North East Carder stuff. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=470.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm talking numbers and impact. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=472.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=473.91999999999996s)]
*  You asked about Herod. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=474.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=475.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=475.84s)]
*  Kevin Durant was the literal MVP in the seasons you're talking about. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=476.47999999999996s)]
*  I get it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=480.24s)]
*  I love Kevin Durant. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=480.68s)]
*  I'm just saying from a numbers standpoint, he's in the vicinity and from a winning [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=481.92s)]
*  standpoint, he's been incredibly successful as the best player in a team that over and [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=486.6s)]
*  over again is in the top four of the top two. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=490.48s)]
*  And yet now we've hit the point where people are like, fuck this. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=494.04s)]
*  He's not that good. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=496.76s)]
*  And you could feel it the last couple of days based on what happened in game one. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=498.08000000000004s)]
*  We talked about it on this podcast where if Brown doesn't bail him out on that three, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=501.52000000000004s)]
*  it's two days of Tatum, Tatum, Tatum, what the hell's going on with this guy, which is [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=506.56s)]
*  what it turned into being anyway. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=510.64s)]
*  So then he sucks in the first half of game one. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=512.4s)]
*  What do you think it's here? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=514.96s)]
*  I'm thinking that this guy probably is not basing the level of competition that he needs [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=518.08s)]
*  to. And I was thinking that the whole night watching this game, that first game was really [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=522.92s)]
*  fun, you know, and it was, it was really exciting. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=526.72s)]
*  And, and, and, you know, it was like watching Keystone cops out there at the end. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=529.12s)]
*  But when it comes to like watching the Western Conference playoffs and watching what it's [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=533.12s)]
*  done to some of these guys and how it's made them raise their game or in Kyrie's case, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=536.96s)]
*  like revive his game to some extent and just watching like these guys reputationally, but [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=541.52s)]
*  also obviously performance wise have to step up because they they can't screw up or screw [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=545.92s)]
*  around the way Tatum did in the first half of this game. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=551.84s)]
*  And yeah, I'm like, is it unfair? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=554.36s)]
*  Sure. But I actually like even for a while tonight, I was like kind of trying to imagine [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=556.24s)]
*  if Tatum and Siakam were on like swap teams and like how we would think about those guys [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=560.92s)]
*  differently. And like, what would Jason Tatum on a like, I'm trying to drag a mid market [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=566.24s)]
*  team to relevance and just throw it all on my back kind of thing would be and what what [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=571.6s)]
*  his sort of persona would be and how it would be different. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=576.48s)]
*  I think that Tatum just suffers from being like exactly who you just described, which [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=579.4399999999999s)]
*  is like the sixth or seventh best player. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=584.52s)]
*  And I don't know, I don't really think he's that cool. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=587.04s)]
*  Like, I think that's also a thing that happens is like he doesn't have that cool of a game. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=591.52s)]
*  It's a it's very like drudgery. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=595.9200000000001s)]
*  It's like a lot of drudgery to watch. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=598.9200000000001s)]
*  So that I think is like is like mounting up against him. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=600.32s)]
*  But, you know, he had a good second half. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=603.64s)]
*  I mean, they just bodied those guys in the second half. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=605.4s)]
*  Like this is this thing is over. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=607.5600000000001s)]
*  There's also that thing going on with him and Brown where they do make each other's [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=609.88s)]
*  lives easier in certain ways. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=614.1600000000001s)]
*  But really, their primary value to each other is in games like this, where Tatum can be [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=615.76s)]
*  off for a half or three quarters and Jalen Brown can just pick everything up and make [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=620.2s)]
*  it work. And it wasn't just the scoring, but he was the driving force leading to all [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=624.72s)]
*  those threes for Boston, too. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=628.52s)]
*  You don't really see that in a lot of other star situations. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=630.52s)]
*  A lot of the other ones are built in some way to be more directly complimentary. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=633.48s)]
*  Even when you think about Luca and Kyrie, for example, their games fit together in a [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=637.44s)]
*  way that Tatum and Brown don't necessarily I'm not saying those guys don't work, don't [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=641.72s)]
*  fit or can't win a championship. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=645.0400000000001s)]
*  Don't. Yeah, they like each other. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=646.36s)]
*  Like all those things. Yeah, clearly it works at a really high level, but it doesn't work [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=647.6800000000001s)]
*  at a level that augments both of them and makes them really, really pop. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=651.88s)]
*  And so when we're talking about what's missing, some of it is that pop and some of it is the [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=655.72s)]
*  fact that there are just five or six guys who are better than Jason Tatum right now. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=659.4399999999999s)]
*  And that's OK. And frankly, that might not stop Boston from winning the title anyway. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=662.92s)]
*  Right. Three first team OMBAs ain't nothing. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=667.08s)]
*  But I have a and I'm going to say this, I just want people to know this is a joke. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=670.8s)]
*  But a friend of mine, we always joke about Jalen Brown. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=676.2s)]
*  He's basically like the middle brother in the family. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=679.8s)]
*  Jason Tatum's elder brother. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=682.5999999999999s)]
*  So when Tatum has a game like tonight, the first half and Jalen's having a game like [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=684.04s)]
*  he's having, we start joking like, oh, my God, this is the Jalen Brown dream game. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=688.4799999999999s)]
*  These guys have been awesome teammates. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=693.56s)]
*  They pick each other up. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=695.1999999999999s)]
*  But it's just kind of funny. Back to what Rob said. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=696.8399999999999s)]
*  It is like a little bit of a seesaw when one guy is down, the other guy goes up and vice [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=700.4s)]
*  versa. And that's a good thing. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=704.76s)]
*  And when they're home and together, the Celtics are completely unstoppable. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=706.5600000000001s)]
*  But Jalen was awesome today and there was a little sauce behind it. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=710.08s)]
*  We're taping this before the press conferences after the game, but he didn't get all [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=713.5200000000001s)]
*  NBA. And I voted for him. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=717.2s)]
*  I made the case for him during the awards. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=721.1600000000001s)]
*  I've also there's been years where I haven't voted for Tatum as the highest team. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=723.4000000000001s)]
*  Like, I really try to be, you know, take all the biases out in this case. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=728.0s)]
*  Like, I felt like they won 64 games mainly because of those two guys and mainly [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=733.0s)]
*  because those guys sacrificed a lot. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=738.56s)]
*  And Booker made it. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=741.08s)]
*  And I just think there's no way Jalen was worse than Booker this season when you [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=743.72s)]
*  think like he never had to. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=747.92s)]
*  He never chased his stats. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=749.44s)]
*  He always did whatever was best for the team. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=751.2s)]
*  And the team was super successful. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=754.0s)]
*  They were successful because of those two guys and how hard they played night after [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=755.6s)]
*  night after night, how durable they are. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=760.48s)]
*  And if we're if we're just not going to reward that with the NBA, right, I don't [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=762.76s)]
*  know what the NBA is for anymore. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=766.88s)]
*  Then it's for money. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=768.44s)]
*  Now, winning doesn't matter. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=769.48s)]
*  It's just it's a stat award now. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=770.64s)]
*  Well, it's a contract award, which is kind of perverted in the first place because it [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=773.24s)]
*  just becomes like this thing that's tied to compensation in a way that is like, you [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=776.8s)]
*  know, I don't I don't have a vote. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=781.44s)]
*  I wouldn't even know what to do with myself if I had a vote. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=782.68s)]
*  And it was like this guy's either going to make sixty five million extra dollars or [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=785.04s)]
*  not, like based on whether or not I think he's better than Devin Booker. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=788.72s)]
*  That's crazy. Right. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=791.28s)]
*  Especially when you put look, we don't need more media members complaining about the [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=792.6s)]
*  responsibility of voting for these things. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=796.52s)]
*  But I'll say given what we're talking about now and what we're choosing to award and [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=798.6s)]
*  reward, you want to reward players who are sacrificing for their teams to win. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=802.72s)]
*  If more money is going to be handed to somebody, let it be the people who are giving [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=808.4399999999999s)]
*  up so that their teams can be better. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=812.64s)]
*  And yet we do simplify it with the stats. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=814.64s)]
*  We do simplify with very often the very basic box score type production and who put up [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=817.64s)]
*  those numbers in a flashier way than somebody else. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=823.2s)]
*  And Jalen got the short end of the stick in that regard. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=825.52s)]
*  But I agree with you. He's like he had a better season than Devin Booker. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=828.32s)]
*  God knows he's a better defender than Devin Booker. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=831.8000000000001s)]
*  And that's a big part of the Tatum conversation, too, that we I think we gloss over a [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=834.0s)]
*  little too easily. Really, really good defender. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=837.16s)]
*  Yeah, it has to be a part of the story with those guys. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=839.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's a case where the stats have kind of gone wrong because Booker, who [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=842.6s)]
*  if you didn't have league pass and you just lived in like a shack somewhere in Alaska [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=847.72s)]
*  and you just looked at box scores, you'd be like, oh, yeah, he's one of the best 15 [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=851.48s)]
*  players. That team had a fucked up chemistry all year, which he has to have at least a [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=854.24s)]
*  small part of. I didn't really feel like he made anybody else on his team better. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=859.12s)]
*  The team was really compared to what we all thought was going to happen with them. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=864.2s)]
*  I think they were pretty disappointing. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=869.0400000000001s)]
*  And Jalen, all he did all year was he guarded all types of players, you know, really [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=871.08s)]
*  took challenges on like there was games where he carded Zion. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=876.28s)]
*  I just I thought he had a really good season. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=879.72s)]
*  He's sure he's frustrated. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=882.0799999999999s)]
*  I've been watching him for eight years. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=883.72s)]
*  He'll do some things. You're like, why did you take that shot? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=884.9599999999999s)]
*  Or, oh, my God. Oh, Jalen's hasn't taken a shot in five minutes. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=887.12s)]
*  So, you know, this one's going up like, yeah, everybody's got flaws. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=891.28s)]
*  Everybody's annoying sometimes. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=894.24s)]
*  But that guy's a winning player. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=896.12s)]
*  And he's the second biggest reason they went 64 and 18 right now in the playoffs. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=897.6s)]
*  They are 10 and two. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=902.72s)]
*  So this team is 74 and 20 and they had one all NBA player. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=904.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Suns and the Lakers had four. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=908.4s)]
*  Like, what are we doing? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=911.44s)]
*  What what is this? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=913.12s)]
*  And then the other thing I was thinking with the ballot is like, let's vote for MVP. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=914.12s)]
*  Let's vote 10 places because we need the forwards and the guards. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=918.0s)]
*  Like Jalen was one of the best five or six forwards in the league. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=921.9200000000001s)]
*  If we can't use the NBA's things capture as a snapshot, who are the best [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=925.48s)]
*  guys at the different positions? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=929.5600000000001s)]
*  Then we're doing something wrong. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=932.12s)]
*  Why are we only voting for five spots for the MVP? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=933.84s)]
*  Expand that to 10. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=936.24s)]
*  And that's a better kind of litmus test for the 10 most impactful players. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=937.84s)]
*  And then we have the NBA teams. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=942.0s)]
*  Anyway, I thought this was a big reason why Jalen kicked us tonight, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=943.32s)]
*  because it's offensive that he didn't make the team. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=947.12s)]
*  Anyway, that's my rant. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=950.44s)]
*  See, are any thoughts? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=951.76s)]
*  I don't. I do hate the Celtics. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=953.84s)]
*  I'm I'm pretty I'm pretty much in agreement with you. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=956.2s)]
*  I mean, to the extent that I think that these kinds of all NBA slots are [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=959.56s)]
*  are are like black and white and you can kind of pick this out. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=964.36s)]
*  I do think that Jalen Brown had a better season than Devin Booker from my from my [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=967.48s)]
*  opinion, just as as a league pass, colon, night country guy in an Alaskan shack. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=971.1999999999999s)]
*  You know, we watched 10 games this year. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=976.24s)]
*  I agree. Yeah. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=978.24s)]
*  That's if that's a beat, by the way, I'm signing up. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=979.6s)]
*  You're down. I'm into it. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=981.96s)]
*  Great. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=984.28s)]
*  How do you think about the idea, though, about like [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=986.28s)]
*  every other night, it's like you're watching the Western Conference playoffs [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=989.92s)]
*  and it feels like you're on a complete bender because it's so awesome [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=993.72s)]
*  and everybody is flying all over the place. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=997.88s)]
*  The crowds are going crazy. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=999.56s)]
*  It feels like we're on the in the front seat of like these two emergent [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1001.8s)]
*  franchises that are like really finally taking the leap. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1006.12s)]
*  Don't you think the Celtics are getting punished a little bit because [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1009.88s)]
*  nobody's really like they didn't get the Knicks and they didn't get the Sixers [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1014.0799999999999s)]
*  and they didn't get the Bucks and they're just playing the hand that they're dealt? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1016.88s)]
*  Didn't this happen to LeBron for like eight straight years? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1019.68s)]
*  It did. But like LeBron was like, we're all sitting here waiting for you to catch Jordan. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1022.16s)]
*  I feel like LeBron's greatness was so [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1026.6399999999999s)]
*  was so like amplified, like from the second he got in the league. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1030.68s)]
*  I know there was always a lot of like, yeah, we win the big game. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1034.68s)]
*  But like, I don't know, I just I there was something I feel like those paces. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1037.96s)]
*  He like those there were some series in the Eastern Conference that were fun. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1042.36s)]
*  And this just feels like, yeah, but think about the reasons we [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1045.96s)]
*  lost Giannis and we lost Summer Dame and the Bucks get knocked out. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1049.6s)]
*  Yeah. And maybe now Halliburton. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1053.76s)]
*  Yeah. And Bede, Halliburton and Cleveland. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1055.68s)]
*  Like might have had a punctuous chance with Mitchell. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1058.8s)]
*  He misses the last two games of that series. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1061.32s)]
*  So I think from an injury standpoint, the Celts have been about as lucky as he gets. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1064.04s)]
*  But this is like an NBA thing where you look at the Lakers in the 1980s, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1067.48s)]
*  where all the good teams are in the East. Right. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1072.68s)]
*  You have the Celtics, you have the Sixers, you have Milwaukee. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1075.24s)]
*  And then you have Detroit and even Atlanta. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1079.12s)]
*  And then you go to the other side with the with the West. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1081.68s)]
*  And it's like their two biggest threats in the entire 80s [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1083.92s)]
*  are the Mavericks, who immediately become disappointing. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1088.0s)]
*  And Roy Tarpley has a whole cocaine thing. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1091.96s)]
*  And they're a threat for like one playoff series. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1094.12s)]
*  And then that goes away. Rob knows those teams. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1096.84s)]
*  But that that was like the up and coming awesome team. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1099.8s)]
*  And it just didn't happen. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1102.72s)]
*  And then the other team was Houston, who actually beat them in 86 [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1103.8799999999999s)]
*  with Samson, Elijah on. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1107.68s)]
*  And then the next year, drug scandal, Samson gets hurt. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1108.92s)]
*  And those guys disappear, too. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1111.92s)]
*  And the Lakers never get tested. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1113.3600000000001s)]
*  This is just kind of how it happens. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1115.6000000000001s)]
*  You look at the West, OKC, Dallas, Denver, Minnesota. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1117.0800000000002s)]
*  Those are four of the five best teams in the league. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1122.5600000000002s)]
*  And they just for whatever reason are clustered in the West. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1125.04s)]
*  Golden State couldn't even get in the playoffs. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1127.96s)]
*  You know, like this is why they need to do this one through 16. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1129.76s)]
*  Oh, you're going there. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1133.64s)]
*  Yeah. What the hell? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1135.0800000000002s)]
*  I mean, like, why not? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1136.48s)]
*  Man, like I've got like nine streaming services. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1137.76s)]
*  They can get a taco delivered to my house. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1140.24s)]
*  Can we can we send that in to Zazloff? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1142.08s)]
*  He's trying to match them up. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1144.32s)]
*  Zazloff's like, I'll match one for 16. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1146.76s)]
*  Yeah. 2.6. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1149.32s)]
*  I will say, Bill, think about how far you had to pull back [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1151.6399999999999s)]
*  to find the Western Conference team not being able to prove themselves [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1154.48s)]
*  against quality competition. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1158.12s)]
*  If we're going back to Roy Tarpley, it illustrates something important, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1160.72s)]
*  which is basically during my entire lifetime, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1163.48s)]
*  the Western Conference has been pretty significantly superior to the East. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1167.08s)]
*  Yeah. And there are there's some systemic reasons for that. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1170.96s)]
*  There's some trend reasons for that. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1174.2s)]
*  Part of it, honestly, is LeBron beating the snot out of so many would be teams [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1175.8s)]
*  for so long, they basically dissolved. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1180.2s)]
*  That's that's a part of that equation. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1182.52s)]
*  But I don't know the West being better than the East is pretty much [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1184.6s)]
*  NBA business as usual. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1187.32s)]
*  Well, the the LeBron thing. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1189.1200000000001s)]
*  The Bulls were the team. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1192.24s)]
*  The Bulls were going to be they were going to be the rival. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1194.16s)]
*  And Rose gets hurt at the beginning of the 2012 playoffs, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1197.0s)]
*  right as we're headed toward an absolute awesome bloodbath [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1200.68s)]
*  in the Eastern Finals. We don't get to see that. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1204.28s)]
*  The Bulls get basically pulled away. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1207.6s)]
*  The Celtics get old and it just kind of never happened. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1209.76s)]
*  And then, you know, for whatever reason, a lot of the talent started [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1213.16s)]
*  coming in on the West side. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1216.1200000000001s)]
*  I think I think the East could rally next year [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1217.92s)]
*  because you figure Milwaukee would be better. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1221.44s)]
*  You figure Philly, once you guys get Paul George and Pascal Siakam, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1223.24s)]
*  that team's going to be absolutely loaded. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1227.32s)]
*  They have four all stars. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1229.04s)]
*  Orlando's one guy away. Am I on the bench? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1231.28s)]
*  Like, we'll see what happens with Cleveland. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1233.64s)]
*  But I do think the East will be in better shape. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1238.2s)]
*  But it also speaks to the pressure now on this Boston team, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1240.28s)]
*  you know, to just basically handed this gift horse [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1244.52s)]
*  with these three series in a row and even like the Knicks. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1248.2s)]
*  So I think could have been a little bit bitchy for them. Right. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1250.64s)]
*  And then, you know, by the time we get to the third quarter of Game 7, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1254.24s)]
*  even Brunson has broken hand. Yeah. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1258.0400000000002s)]
*  So we never got the answer on on one thing I want to know with Tatum. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1260.8000000000002s)]
*  Has he hit a ceiling yet? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1267.0400000000002s)]
*  Or is there one more level to go? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1269.3200000000002s)]
*  Because I still feel like at age 26, I still feel like he's a superstar [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1271.0800000000002s)]
*  work in progress. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1275.72s)]
*  Rob's a little dubious of that. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1278.5600000000002s)]
*  I am too. Yeah. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1280.76s)]
*  If if if nothing about his context changes. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1282.2800000000002s)]
*  So if he's still going to play in this like post-Brad team, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1285.68s)]
*  the way Joe Missoula has them play with lots of the Doris first person thing, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1291.3200000000002s)]
*  I just started to and then I had to switch out because I know that drives you crazy. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1296.44s)]
*  No, I like it. I just missoula. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1300.24s)]
*  What are you? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1302.8400000000001s)]
*  I think that like this is who he's going to be if this is the way [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1305.0800000000002s)]
*  the South X play and this is the way the South X roster is made up. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1308.08s)]
*  OK. Yeah. What do you think, Rob? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1311.0s)]
*  I think it's reasonable to expect subtle but meaningful improvement. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1312.44s)]
*  You know, little things on the edges, little things in terms of his mentality [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1317.68s)]
*  or the balance of a team. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1321.6399999999999s)]
*  But at this point in their career, most guys kind of are who they are by that age, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1322.72s)]
*  especially if you have had the opportunities in terms of offensive creation [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1327.28s)]
*  that he's that he's had. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1330.3999999999999s)]
*  It's one thing if you're coming up as a role guy [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1331.6s)]
*  and suddenly you're thrown into a dramatically different context, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1334.04s)]
*  as Chris is saying, and your whole career transforms. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1336.52s)]
*  Jason Tatum has been a star for a long time. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1338.84s)]
*  And to his credit, he's done a lot with it. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1341.44s)]
*  But I think the reason that the Celtics would eventually get over the hump [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1343.6s)]
*  would not be that he is a dramatically different player. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1347.96s)]
*  It's just that they win a couple more games that they otherwise would have lost. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1350.44s)]
*  Maybe he has a couple fourth quarters that he might not have had in a previous run. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1353.96s)]
*  But ultimately, I think this is who he is. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1357.72s)]
*  And that player is really damn good and maybe good enough. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1359.92s)]
*  He's an excellent one level below the top guys in the league guy [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1363.56s)]
*  who is a streaky three point shooter. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1367.68s)]
*  And we saw Game Six, Philly, Game Seven, Philly last year. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1369.72s)]
*  We saw Game Six, Milwaukee the year before. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1373.2s)]
*  When he's feeling it, it's magical. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1376.4s)]
*  But it seems like it comes and goes. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1378.68s)]
*  A lot more comes and goes frequently than some of the other great players. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1383.24s)]
*  So I would say the last thing that that's a system thing or that's a guy [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1387.44s)]
*  as a him thing, you know, like because there's something about like I was watching [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1390.6399999999999s)]
*  whatever. I think it was towards the end of the last Dallas series against the thunder. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1395.76s)]
*  And Kyrie had some game where he had like 11 points or something. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1399.56s)]
*  I can't recall those. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1402.08s)]
*  But when the game's over, all the guys are freaking out about Kyrie [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1403.24s)]
*  and like what he did and what you don't see. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1406.8799999999999s)]
*  And like it's like Kyrie did this and then he said this before the game. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1409.24s)]
*  I think that Tatum kind of lacks that like nobody's going to go after this game [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1413.6s)]
*  or if Tatum had a bad game, like I don't think Tatum has that like, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1418.84s)]
*  man, you guys don't understand. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1424.1999999999998s)]
*  Jason galvanized us and he did everything on the court. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1425.4399999999998s)]
*  But score, it kind of feels like it's a little bit more like [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1428.4399999999998s)]
*  if he gets his 26 to 30, it's like a normal Jason Tatum night. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1432.36s)]
*  And if he doesn't, he's he's shit. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1435.76s)]
*  You agree with that, Rob? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1438.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, shit seems strong. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1440.12s)]
*  No, but like that's the way that that's the way that I mean, it's all. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1441.6s)]
*  Yeah, that's the narrative. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1444.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's how Boston reacts to stuff. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1445.72s)]
*  You know, like, yeah. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1447.48s)]
*  The irony of that is I think Tatum does do a lot of those sorts of things, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1448.76s)]
*  but doesn't necessarily give the energy or get the credit. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1453.44s)]
*  Narratively speaking, game one was like that. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1456.64s)]
*  He was he had a really good defense rebounding game and got no credit for it. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1458.8s)]
*  After I suspect if you zoom all the way in and go into like film session [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1462.88s)]
*  kind of mode and diagnose every Celtics play, you will find all sorts of small [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1467.64s)]
*  things that he does, whether it's, you know, pull over a superior defender [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1471.56s)]
*  so that Jalen Brown can attack, whether it's the way he rotates on defense [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1475.04s)]
*  to shield other guys and protect them. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1478.4s)]
*  He's doing all that stuff. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1481.0s)]
*  It's just guys like Kyrie have a mystique [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1482.8s)]
*  and will always get the respect because of that mystique. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1485.44s)]
*  And Tatum, for all the reasons we've illuminated, just kind of doesn't [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1488.4s)]
*  doesn't have that. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1491.56s)]
*  And it changes the way we talk about it, but it doesn't necessarily change [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1492.88s)]
*  what he's offering on the court. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1495.56s)]
*  I think I think the guy is on the court does have a lot of those qualities. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1496.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1500.56s)]
*  I'm a Tatum defender. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1502.24s)]
*  I'm way more glass half full than I think most people. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1503.4s)]
*  The three point shooting drives me a little nuts. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1506.16s)]
*  But, you know, it's like those actors. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1508.0800000000002s)]
*  It's like Robert Duvall. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1511.2s)]
*  There's not a lot of Robert Duvall conversations, right? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1512.3600000000001s)]
*  Incredible actor, but it's more fun to talk about Pacino and De Niro and Jimmy Khan. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1515.2s)]
*  Nobody's like, oh, man, Duvall, the judge. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1520.6000000000001s)]
*  He was killing it. Yeah. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1523.2800000000002s)]
*  What do you we're like, oh, man, Duvall, what are you talking about? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1524.76s)]
*  That we are. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1528.2800000000002s)]
*  Well, most people are. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1529.2s)]
*  It's like, oh, Duval pod. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1530.68s)]
*  The ball hall fame is never happening. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1533.1200000000001s)]
*  Please title this episode Jason Tatum, colon NBA's Robert Duvall. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1536.0s)]
*  And see if it's the worst or best episode ever. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1541.7600000000002s)]
*  Well, I'll ask you guys this. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1544.7600000000002s)]
*  The Netflix series that they're doing. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1547.48s)]
*  Yeah. Tatum's one of the guys that quarterbacks version or whatever. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1549.4s)]
*  LeBron's in it. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1553.4s)]

*  Who do you think's going to steal the show? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1559.5600000000002s)]
*  Anthony Edwards. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1561.24s)]
*  He already stole one Netflix show. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1562.4s)]
*  Right. It's just what he does. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1564.6000000000001s)]
*  Tatum's going to be in it and you'll get to know him better. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1566.3600000000001s)]
*  And by the way, his story is awesome. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1568.8400000000001s)]
*  His mom, the her whole background and all the all the ways that [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1571.0s)]
*  she's just around his life and all the things she does. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1576.3600000000001s)]
*  She's really unique and a really cool lady. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1579.52s)]
*  People are going to be like, where's it? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1582.8000000000002s)]
*  Can we go back to Ant's house? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1584.44s)]
*  He's playing video games like what's going on? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1586.1200000000001s)]
*  That guy. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1588.2s)]
*  Ant's decided to take up soccer. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1589.92s)]
*  Come on, let's go back to him. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1591.92s)]
*  Somebody just challenged Ant and Wiffleball. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1594.1200000000001s)]
*  What? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1596.3200000000002s)]
*  So Indiana, is this a sweep, Rob? [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1598.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean, game one. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1601.96s)]
*  Game one was their game. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1602.8400000000001s)]
*  Let's say Halliburton's gone for the series. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1604.48s)]
*  Is it a sweep? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1606.24s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1607.2s)]
*  They're going to get one in Indy. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1608.0s)]
*  I think there's like a crazy. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1609.2s)]
*  I feel like Boston will blow in an Indy. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1610.8400000000001s)]
*  Like fast break out of no like just just absolutely insane. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1612.3200000000002s)]
*  130, 120 game. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1616.0s)]
*  It took our guy Joe Maz, a Luke Cornette injury to finally play Brissette in a [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1618.2s)]
*  series against his old team when he's the perfect bench guy to come in and [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1623.4s)]
*  switch on defense and just play with energy and be around the rim. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1629.44s)]
*  Like it's like, gee, I wish we had somebody on that team. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1633.8400000000001s)]
*  Oh wait, we do. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1636.3200000000002s)]
*  It's Brissette. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1636.96s)]
*  He never plays. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1637.48s)]
*  I'm on more text change over the last seven months. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1638.6000000000001s)]
*  Probably the most random sentence in all my texts over the last eight months is, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1641.24s)]
*  hey, why doesn't he play Brissette more? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1646.0s)]
*  Just going both ways. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1648.1200000000001s)]
*  People texting me that me texting other people. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1649.1200000000001s)]
*  So finally Brissette played and I think he was like plus 17 and 10 minutes at one point. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1651.76s)]
*  I feel like Boston will blow an Indy game. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1659.28s)]
*  The fact that you're just their history will be just to kind of not take a half [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1662.64s)]
*  seriously and also they're down 15. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1667.64s)]
*  I think that's very possible. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1669.68s)]
*  But what they've shown in this series and all their series so far is that they [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1671.16s)]
*  win most of those games anyway. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1674.3999999999999s)]
*  Sometimes they will blow one. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1676.4399999999998s)]
*  But without Halliburton, I just don't know. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1677.72s)]
*  I do think this game, look, the Pacers are not a heavyweight opponent in the current [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1680.3999999999999s)]
*  form for a team like the Celtics. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1686.0s)]
*  They're just not really on that level in terms of talent. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1687.6399999999999s)]
*  But a game like this one and walling off, you know, they'll kind of points in the [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1689.96s)]
*  paint thing I mentioned earlier. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1694.1599999999999s)]
*  Getting back in transition, like playing Indiana is a test of your discipline as a [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1696.36s)]
*  team. Yeah. Can you do this for 48? [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1700.76s)]
*  Can you sprint back for 48 minutes, put a wall in front of these guys, make them [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1703.08s)]
*  dance around side to side and prevent them from getting to the rim? [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1707.64s)]
*  The fact that they can do that and they just showed it even in a game where they're [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1710.68s)]
*  honestly not playing great. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1714.16s)]
*  It doesn't hearten like my opinion of Indiana's chances. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1716.24s)]
*  I just don't feel good about where the Pacers are right now, despite the fact that [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1720.12s)]
*  they nearly stole game one, despite the fact that Pascal Siakam almost stole this [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1723.8799999999999s)]
*  one before things kind of went sideways on them. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1727.72s)]
*  Yeah, I thought I mean, it's honestly I'm just going to try and avoid Indiana style, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1730.2800000000002s)]
*  enjoy Indiana style of play because Boston animus aside, like that's a very [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1735.4s)]
*  and I guess that's a good name for a podcast animus aside. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1743.2800000000002s)]
*  And it's a side with one of the two. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1747.24s)]
*  It's basically people who hate something being like, I'll hate I'll give them this. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1749.68s)]
*  You know, here's your flowers. But I. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1753.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's like Indiana just plays a style of basketball that I find refreshing. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1755.0s)]
*  You know, ripping it out on a make flying up the court, taking these little mid [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1759.3999999999999s)]
*  range twos when they when they have them rather than always kicking out. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1764.72s)]
*  I just find it really enjoyable. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1767.8s)]
*  And you're going to have to like that's going to basically be like your takeaway [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1769.3999999999999s)]
*  from the Indiana. It was like basically thanks for playing. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1772.04s)]
*  And that was entertaining. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1774.36s)]
*  The Boston thing, it's like, you know, it'll probably be like five. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1775.72s)]
*  I mean, I think Indiana will get one in Indy. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1779.1599999999999s)]
*  But this is the story of the Celtics, isn't it? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1783.24s)]
*  It's like the other team has a fun style of play. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1785.0s)]
*  The other stars like glimmer in a way that Jason Tatum might not. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1787.32s)]
*  But if they win, no one can take that away from you. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1792.12s)]
*  Like, that stuff doesn't matter if you. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1795.12s)]
*  Celtics have played one hundred and I think six playoff games with Tatum and Brown. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1797.04s)]
*  So there's just a familiarity. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1802.0s)]
*  It's there a little bit of a no win. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1804.48s)]
*  I would argue when they have poor Zingas, this is a really fun team to watch. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1806.24s)]
*  Like, I really enjoyed watching them when they had everybody and in holiday [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1812.12s)]
*  and white are just an absolute delight. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1816.36s)]
*  I mean, they're they're like almost like they could have been great. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1818.32s)]
*  2004 Patriots. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1822.1999999999998s)]
*  I'm a big Drew Holiday fan. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1823.9599999999998s)]
*  I just those guys are just winning players. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1825.8s)]
*  And the fact that the Bucks fans were like, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1828.56s)]
*  yeah, good luck. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1832.4399999999998s)]
*  Wait till pro playoff drew shows up. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1833.52s)]
*  And it's like, you mean, playoff drew the guy that won a title for you [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1836.7199999999998s)]
*  and threw one of the great alley oops of the history of the league. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1839.52s)]
*  That guy. Yeah, well, we'll take him. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1841.8s)]
*  That sounds great. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzHWAyfb-yQ&t=1844.04s)]
