# Can Anyone Beat The Oklahoma City Thunder? With Zach Lowe | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw)
*  I was kind of deep down hoping we were going to get a really fun Timberwolves [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=0.0s)]
*  OKC game one and then for about a quarter and a half it felt like we're [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=5.0s)]
*  heading that way and then OKC does the thing that they do from time to time [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=8.8s)]
*  where their defense just shifts it's shape shifters they just turn it up a [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=12.64s)]
*  different way and then all of a sudden the games over and you're like what [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=19.0s)]
*  happened how is this an 18-point game it was just they were just up by two a [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=21.88s)]
*  second ago and that was it so I don't know you take anything away from this or [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=26.28s)]
*  is it just typical game one well first of all the Wolves are ahead by four [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=29.76s)]
*  points halfway through the third quarter Mike Conley had a little had a little [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=34.800000000000004s)]
*  flurry little flurry Mike Conley hit a three it was 60 to 56 with 722 left but [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=38.2s)]
*  look I said this before the series I picked Thunder in six don't feel any [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=43.2s)]
*  better I guess I have to feel slightly better about that pick but the bottom [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=47.6s)]
*  line is this the most consistent unit let's call it left in the playoffs is [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=51.08s)]
*  Oklahoma City's defense every single night they're gonna be an absolute bear [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=56.04s)]
*  to score on them no one has really found an answer at any point of the season [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=60.76s)]
*  Denver did pretty well against them in the regular season spoiler alert that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=65.88s)]
*  did not last until playoffs even with the best player in the world yeah trying [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=69.12s)]
*  every trick he has and they just reach a frenzy and you know like Julius Randall [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=73.08s)]
*  posting up it's just like watch out like where is it where's the hell is there [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=80.52s)]
*  any help coming from is Lou Dorkin gonna pull the chair where the arm there just [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=84.12s)]
*  arms everywhere and you know look 17 turnovers doesn't sound that bad for [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=86.88s)]
*  Minnesota I mean it's not great but doesn't sound that bad 13 of those were [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=93.64s)]
*  steals and that plus a free throw margin that is even and or slightly an edge to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=97.44s)]
*  Oklahoma City is just the Wolves are dead on arrival against this [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=103.12s)]
*  defensive those stats trend that way yeah it felt like this was the game about 30 [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=107.12s)]
*  40 minutes and it's like all right they're gonna get this one if they're [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=113.42s)]
*  gonna get a game right everything's going well Randall's playing out of his [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=115.86s)]
*  ass and okay so you look nervous I know case he looked a little tired from maybe [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=119.22s)]
*  that seven gamer and it was interesting when Ken Rich Williams came in love it [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=125.38s)]
*  Kenny hustle baby unbelievable like would he have been the fifth best nugget [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=130.01999999999998s)]
*  where do you have him ranked on nuggets could he have played 35 minutes a game [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=134.26s)]
*  for the nuggets he's he was plus 19 and nine minutes made every shot that he [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=137.94s)]
*  took unbelievable so when he did that I'm like is this a tactical move or did [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=142.58s)]
*  he extend the bench today because he was worried his team was a little worn out [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=148.82000000000002s)]
*  or what's going on and did he lose faith in Caruso all of a sudden and then [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=152.18s)]
*  Caruso came in and played one of the great stretches he's had in the playoffs [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=156.3s)]
*  so that was that answered that question yeah Caruso's making threes guarding [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=161.34s)]
*  Randall as I think one I think everyone was reminded that oh yeah he's gonna [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=166.10000000000002s)]
*  guard Randall when he guarded Jokic at the end of the series and Ken Rich [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=170.1s)]
*  Williams he's like a beloved guy there you know for years they've been saying [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=173.29999999999998s)]
*  he's gonna be Nick Collison 2.0 for us he's just gonna be a lifer here we love [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=177.34s)]
*  him he's about all the right things hadn't really done much in the playoffs [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=181.34s)]
*  in the real playoffs I'm not gonna count the Memphis series it's a cool moment he [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=185.14s)]
*  may not do much from here on out but that's a big that was a big stretch of [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=189.45999999999998s)]
*  basketball for him is a cool moment was he had a big three two so the things I [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=192.9s)]
*  was worried about heading into this game what are we getting from Mike Conley [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=198.3s)]
*  who's old going against this gauntlet you called on Sunday's pod or Monday's [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=202.26000000000002s)]
*  pod you said you thought okay sees defense is now going way up there I [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=207.82000000000002s)]
*  want to see it for four rounds because I I'm still licking my wounds from jumping [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=212.66000000000003s)]
*  the gun with Minnesota last year when they look good in round two and all the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=218.5s)]
*  sudden I was comparing them to the 89 piston so I'm just I have the training [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=222.0s)]
*  wheels on for all defense takes in these playoffs but I you know the bones are [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=225.86s)]
*  there I think what makes them special is is the different looks and how they can [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=231.5s)]
*  do the big and small how they can put like oh we're just gonna try to get a [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=235.78s)]
*  lot of steals lineup they they have looks like a football team that I don't [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=239.38000000000002s)]
*  really remember seeing I guess that the you know you go back to the 89 pistons [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=243.06s)]
*  and teams of that ilk that could kind of change their look depending on what you [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=247.54000000000002s)]
*  had they're on pace but what they did today is they do it over and over again [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=252.22s)]
*  they just go on these runs and their defense fueled which is so unusual in [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=257.54s)]
*  the league right the runs that we usually have in the league are threes and [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=261.78s)]
*  or somebody getting hot this team can have runs based on steals and pressure [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=267.46s)]
*  and picking up guys at half court that one sequence I know you know what I'm [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=273.02s)]
*  about to say when Edwards was bringing the ball up and Caruso kind of jumped on [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=276.7s)]
*  him and then he almost lost he almost fell over for a backcourt just because [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=282.42s)]
*  of the pressure and then got it back and then just like launched a terrible three [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=287.26s)]
*  nobody else is doing that in the league and I think that's what makes them [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=290.38s)]
*  special is they just throw things defensively they're like I've not seen [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=294.34s)]
*  that anywhere yeah they have they have a couple every game where it's just oh the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=298.46s)]
*  guy just either fell over along the sideline under pressure bringing the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=303.42s)]
*  ball up or dribble the ball off his foot or I don't quite know what happened I [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=307.42s)]
*  have to watch the replay to see what went haywire here but you mentioned [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=311.58000000000004s)]
*  different looks and you know I was talking about this before the series we [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=315.94000000000005s)]
*  saw I said it's gonna be a safer series to play Chet as the only big guy on the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=319.38000000000005s)]
*  floor they were afraid to do it against Denver very much and they did it a lot [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=324.3s)]
*  today Hartnestine only played 20 minutes and Chet was awesome I mean it doesn't [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=327.42s)]
*  jump off the stat sheet you know 15-7-3 I just thought he made the kind of plays [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=331.9s)]
*  he needs to make on offense for them to win the championship to for them to win [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=337.29999999999995s)]
*  16 playoff games gonna have to hit some threes he had just won but he was one of [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=340.94s)]
*  one some tough twos some good takes around the basket and just he's they [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=344.29999999999995s)]
*  have him guarding either McDaniels or a little bit go-bare never Julius Randall [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=348.05999999999995s)]
*  they're like we're just keeping you away from that matchup he's gonna bulldoze [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=353.7s)]
*  you and he's saving your sternum and your ribs he's we're gonna make you [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=356.65999999999997s)]
*  we're gonna preserve you as a help defender a lot and he's just everywhere [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=360.62s)]
*  like there was that one play where he had he switched on to Devin Schenzo in [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=363.78s)]
*  the right corner because the wolves kind of moved around their offense a little [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=367.14s)]
*  bit and even shows like cool I'll just drive baseline and see what happens and [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=370.18s)]
*  what happens is Chet's like you're just gonna eat the basketball for dinner how's [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=373.26s)]
*  that how's that feel he was he was awesome and then we saw them close the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=376.34s)]
*  game I mean the game was already kind of closed but with no bigs on the floor [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=379.53999999999996s)]
*  they went to their sort of all wing all-guard switch everything good luck [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=383.21999999999997s)]
*  figuring this thing out line up and you know they have a little bit more line up [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=386.42s)]
*  flexibility I think in this series than they did against Denver and look [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=390.90000000000003s)]
*  Minnesota had 88 points 88 points and I think we I guess we got to talk about [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=395.02000000000004s)]
*  the threes right 15 to 51 53 is 88 points is never a good ratio hard to win in the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=400.14000000000004s)]
*  NBA in 2025 when the other team takes 30 more threes than you and yet they won [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=408.3s)]
*  running away and I'm the tracking data nerves are already flagging it they're [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=412.7s)]
*  already awaiting the second spectrum data tomorrow now did Minnesota [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=417.97999999999996s)]
*  underperform their expected shot variation by what was this just a shot [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=421.46s)]
*  luck game and I'll be interested to see what that data actually says because [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=425.5s)]
*  they missed some good ones but man they make you take first of all no defense is [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=429.5s)]
*  better at helping making you think you're open and then flying back at you [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=433.65999999999997s)]
*  while another guy stunts at you so at least there's like stuff happening in [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=439.58000000000004s)]
*  your line of sight and by the way the guy flying at me has gigantic arms and [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=444.1s)]
*  he's really fast and he's like 23 years old and at the peak of his that his [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=448.34000000000003s)]
*  athleticism and a lot of them watching in real time and we're doing this right [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=451.74s)]
*  after the game I haven't gone back and rewatched them yet they felt like long [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=455.66s)]
*  threes and a lot like early in the shot clock threes and even the ones that are [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=458.90000000000003s)]
*  decent and 29 feet early in the shot clock are long and have the feel of like [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=463.22s)]
*  well I better shoot this one now because it's pretty good and we ain't getting [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=468.08000000000004s)]
*  anything better than this I'm letting it fly and you know I thought for the most [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=471.28000000000003s)]
*  part a lot of those threes were like decently contested and for a lot of this [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=476.88s)]
*  game it was Minnesota missing tough threes and Oklahoma City missing tough [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=481.28000000000003s)]
*  twos and I think what should scare Minnesota a little bit is Oklahoma City [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=486.22s)]
*  started getting easier twos and making more of the twos as the game went on [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=490.96000000000004s)]
*  right well if you're Minnesota the one thing you're gonna come out of the game [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=494.48s)]
*  is we have to get a better whistle on these SGA calls well they were furious [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=498.92s)]
*  the whole game I mean they were they were going into the game which is always [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=503.08000000000004s)]
*  kind of a bad sign if you're already like on edge about it it's it's like [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=506.68s)]
*  you're it feels like you're you just got chill out a little bit except that it's [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=510.52000000000004s)]
*  gonna be bad but yeah I'm sure some clips will be sent to the league office [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=514.4s)]
*  between games one and two deservedly look I you know I tweeted this in real [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=518.44s)]
*  time and I never tweet during games usually but I just thought Shay and I [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=523.88s)]
*  don't care I didn't I didn't bet on the game I didn't really care who won I just [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=528.24s)]
*  hope we have a long fun series but I feel like Shay is getting this whistle [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=532.2s)]
*  that nobody else in the playoffs is getting where there's little touch fouls [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=536.6s)]
*  or these bumps where you're not even sure who initiated the bumps and he's [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=540.76s)]
*  just getting it and I think with Minnesota you can see this you saw it in [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=544.08s)]
*  the Laker series you saw in the last series McDaniels can just have four or [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=548.84s)]
*  five fouls immediately and you don't even know what happened and when when he [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=552.72s)]
*  has fouls I think Minnesota is a different team because he's kind of he's [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=557.6800000000001s)]
*  their swing guy every team has a swing guy I feel like he's their swing guy and [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=562.76s)]
*  once you put foul trouble on him and he's not as not as aggressive it's then [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=566.52s)]
*  it comes down to like his aunt or you know are the threes gonna go in or is [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=572.64s)]
*  aunt gonna go nuts the bench guys were also really bad and there's a there's [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=576.9200000000001s)]
*  officially a Nas Reed storyline that's developed where he's been bad for three [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=581.52s)]
*  weeks now where he hasn't looked like this guy like when they when they really [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=586.36s)]
*  got hot when Randall was out I think it was like February range and he was like [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=590.64s)]
*  20 to 25 a night and you know seven eight rebounds a game and was like [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=594.76s)]
*  really impactful I don't think he's figured out how to impact the team now [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=600.0799999999999s)]
*  that Randall is looking like Randall and today he was one for 11 obviously is [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=604.3199999999999s)]
*  about as bad as it's gonna get but you do that Alexander Walker's three for 11 [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=609.24s)]
*  and and Dante was three for 14 they're not really built to survive three shit [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=612.72s)]
*  bench games right yeah I'm five five of 28 on threes combined for those three [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=618.42s)]
*  guys first of all 28 threes for three bench guys that's almost an [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=627.0s)]
*  accomplishment in and of itself like you're almost having three bench guys [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=630.8s)]
*  take ten threes a piece and you said that about even Mizzou is like I don't [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=634.28s)]
*  know that's a lot I thought I thought Missoula would be like in in like the [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=638.4s)]
*  jungles of the Amazon by now he probably is he doesn't have cable right now he [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=644.04s)]
*  has no cable no streaming right now you know you said that about Nas Reed and it [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=648.68s)]
*  seemed like a little unfair to me because I in my head I mean it's like [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=653.48s)]
*  been a while since the wolves played in my head I'm like he's had some pretty [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=657.8s)]
*  good games I'm looking back last three games against Golden State all single [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=660.3199999999999s)]
*  digits first two we had 30 combined and then two single digit games against the [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=663.92s)]
*  Lakers a really good game one which maybe is the one that's sticking in my [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=668.56s)]
*  head but since then very quiet very quiet and win or lose this series and [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=672.8s)]
*  whatever obviously Minnesota and their new ownership is gonna have some big [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=678.12s)]
*  financial decisions to make and he's a big one hmm I didn't realize we're going [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=682.4799999999999s)]
*  there already no we're not we're not I was just saying you you present no free [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=687.0s)]
*  agents but there's also no cap space and he's such a legend there and [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=690.86s)]
*  deservedly so like the just people just screaming Nas Reed in the streets and [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=696.58s)]
*  holding the Nas Reed towels I hope he stays there forever but look I think [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=701.42s)]
*  Minnesota will work their way into this series but this game was not it not the [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=704.94s)]
*  start you were hoping for it could you come out of this like oh geez man with [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=712.3000000000001s)]
*  this is gonna be tough to score enough against these guys it exacerbated all [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=716.0600000000001s)]
*  the things I was worried about which is ball handling Conley's age the fact that [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=720.22s)]
*  they don't really have a backup point guard that it seems like Edwards is [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=724.74s)]
*  gonna have to have the ball a lot and I think okay see was ready for that [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=727.98s)]
*  especially in the second half you could see like oh you're gonna have Edwards [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=731.9s)]
*  bring it up we're gonna actually make it really difficult for him and okay see [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=734.58s)]
*  with the especially at home with the ability to snap this snap the switch for [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=738.74s)]
*  four minutes I'm worried for Minnesota because I'm trying to think what's the [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=743.14s)]
*  roadmap for them to be awesome in this series when you think how bad okay see [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=749.3s)]
*  played for the first half of this game basically for them and then they still [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=753.2199999999999s)]
*  win the game easily I guess it starts with Edwards it was only 18 points [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=757.14s)]
*  typical like weird feeling it out he does this sometimes he didn't there was [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=763.8199999999999s)]
*  a Laker game like this too there was the first game of the Warriors series where [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=767.9399999999999s)]
*  it's like this it's almost like a feel-out game but it lasts the whole game [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=772.74s)]
*  and then the game's over and they lost but I would assume he's gonna come out [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=775.66s)]
*  way more aggressive I you know you do have to remind yourself all the time [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=779.5s)]
*  don't overreact to game one even if it even and maybe especially if it confirms [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=784.62s)]
*  to your expectations about how the series would go because then your [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=789.5799999999999s)]
*  tendency is to really overreact to it roadmap number one is hit four more [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=792.1s)]
*  threes if you're gonna take 50 and that that does a lot of the work for you but [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=798.0s)]
*  I will continue to say this like if they lose the turnover if they lose the live [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=802.26s)]
*  ball turnover battle like that because Oklahoma City had 12 turnovers only five [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=807.9s)]
*  of those were steals so that's what I say 13 steals to five steals if they [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=812.18s)]
*  lose that battle that badly and they don't win the free throw battle by a [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=816.9399999999999s)]
*  significant margin they're just not gonna win games there's just no math [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=820.58s)]
*  that's gonna help them win games with step one is the threes the ant thing [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=823.78s)]
*  like grade the ant what grade would you give ant this game he does have games [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=828.46s)]
*  like this where like he has moments and first of all I thought for him D plus [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=832.66s)]
*  Wow for him not deep us across the board for him what do you want more of what [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=836.38s)]
*  did you what did you see that concerned you swagger I want I want yo we're [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=842.58s)]
*  playing the best team in the league and I'm in their house and I'm stealing [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=849.46s)]
*  this game from them I didn't feel that at all in this game now he did get hurt [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=852.7s)]
*  in the first half and I don't know if that tweaked whatever was going on and [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=856.66s)]
*  on Randall also had a huge first half so maybe you back off but he's got to win [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=861.66s)]
*  the swagger battle with this that this you beat okay see by it's it sounds [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=867.02s)]
*  stupid and it's the opposite of second spectrum and I liked your second [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=872.22s)]
*  spectrum voice that you broke out by the way that your nerdy second it's like you [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=875.5s)]
*  know I always tell people like I said it about the Celtics after game game one [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=879.0600000000001s)]
*  and game two against the next hang the hang the shot quality championship banner [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=882.98s)]
*  congratulations you had better shot quality you're you're down to 0 in the [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=886.46s)]
*  series you get nothing for that yeah I think for him he's got to be talking [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=889.58s)]
*  shit he's got to feel like he's the alpha on the court I didn't feel that at all [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=894.22s)]
*  in this game Randall ironically was the one that was starting to carry himself [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=899.46s)]
*  that way and it was interesting to watch okay so he swing there everything they [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=902.82s)]
*  were doing defensively to try to just kind of take him out I mean the Caruso [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=906.62s)]
*  piece of this I was thinking how as you know I always want more awards because I [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=910.4s)]
*  think we need stuff to commemorate the season well after the fact and like oh [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=917.48s)]
*  that was the season when this happened and this happened and this happened if [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=921.12s)]
*  we had a role player the playoffs award it feel like Caruso would be like minus [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=924.68s)]
*  700 on Fandl to take it at this point he to watch somebody guard Randall [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=930.52s)]
*  Edwards and Jokic well in a 48 hour span who else is doing that who else is in [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=936.16s)]
*  the it doesn't have to be a bench guy like is Josh Hart in the conversation is [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=945.84s)]
*  Andrew Nemhart in the conversation those guys are other leaders you have to think [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=951.2s)]
*  of it like it's it's a movie poster and it can't be somebody who would be one of [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=956.08s)]
*  the two or three faces in the movie poster or in like the TNT that when [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=960.48s)]
*  they're doing the commercial for the game it would be weird if they were in [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=966.6s)]
*  the game like Julius Randall is not eligible he's Aaron Gordon too good for [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=969.28s)]
*  that I think he is because if you're doing the Nuggets movie poster it's the [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=974.2s)]
*  three guys right so be Christian Brown in that case would be your movie poster [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=978.36s)]
*  is just Jokic sitting on the bench looking sad as the lead is like Frid [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=982.96s)]
*  frittered away they always cut to him it was the first it was the Nico Harrison [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=987.56s)]
*  in the crowd cut when anything bad would happen and then it became the Jokic on [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=992.1199999999999s)]
*  the bench when he's looking up and it's like oh there's 11 minutes and 10 [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=995.5999999999999s)]
*  seconds left in the fourth quarter I probably can't come back yet they want [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1001.3599999999999s)]
*  to think they told me they wanted me to get to nine minutes how did that oh god [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1005.92s)]
*  brush just turn the ball over again oh that's 1050 let's talk can we talk a [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1009.3199999999999s)]
*  little more about it yeah so like the simplest explanation for why Oklahoma [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1015.32s)]
*  City is is very difficult to play against is if you're an and you have the [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1022.44s)]
*  ball at the top of the top of the arc like what what direction are you going [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1026.8400000000001s)]
*  against this defense there's no easy mark to go at I thought at the beginning [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1032.72s)]
*  of the game he was starting to get traction in the go-bare pick and roll [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1038.56s)]
*  just like yeah like not softest part of the defense but just I can always get a [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1042.24s)]
*  big guy like get Hardenstein up up the floor and like maybe I can get around [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1047.0s)]
*  him or there's a pocket pass to go bear or something and then go barely ends up [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1052.04s)]
*  playing 20 minutes they play Chet at center quite a bit when Isaiah Joe was [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1055.52s)]
*  on the floor and really wanted to go at him and they couldn't get that switch [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1059.6s)]
*  like the Thunder were really good at hedging recovering and like you take [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1063.56s)]
*  that out of it it's like I don't know where to go and you could try Shay but [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1066.84s)]
*  and has not really developed like the sort of back to the basket bully ball [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1072.36s)]
*  game that I think he'd like I mean he and I talked about it three four years [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1078.12s)]
*  ago in a phone interview he would like to do that and it just hasn't it's just [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1081.24s)]
*  a there's just not a lot of places to pick at whereas I thought the Thunder [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1084.8s)]
*  gradually were like Shay was like okay particularly when go bears off the floor [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1088.84s)]
*  I can get someplace against Randall I can attack Nas Reed's feet in the pick [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1093.76s)]
*  and roll like I got play it's not great like this is a really good defensive [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1098.76s)]
*  team too but I got things I can do and and is still figuring out kind of where [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1101.92s)]
*  he wants to poke at and I think he's gonna have a game where he finds the [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1106.4s)]
*  right the right places and stuff starts to open up for him maybe part of it is [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1109.56s)]
*  like like he likes to go one-on-one he's an incredible one-on-one player and he [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1113.12s)]
*  can beat almost anybody one-on-one and he had a couple of those in this game but [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1117.32s)]
*  again it's like if it's case and Wallace or somebody like that like that's no [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1123.02s)]
*  picnic and they're gonna pick you a lot of the time too yeah case and Wallace [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1126.02s)]
*  was in there for a little bit and you okay so it says two guys you just [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1130.34s)]
*  completely forgot we're on the team and then they're just kicking ass for three [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1134.58s)]
*  straight minutes I think the thing though Casey seems like they love is if [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1137.92s)]
*  somebody's going straight up one-on-one almost like the old-school one forward [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1142.02s)]
*  and it's like I'm gonna go one-on-one beat a guy and just try to get to the [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1146.54s)]
*  basket they're like great please try that we're ready in so many different [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1149.62s)]
*  ways it seems like you got to attack them on the sides with angles because [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1153.82s)]
*  I feel like the Celtics fell into the same kind of issues with Tatum when it [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1157.06s)]
*  would go bad when it was always like him 40 feet from the basket straight ahead [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1161.1399999999999s)]
*  versus when they would put him on the left or the right and he could kind of [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1165.2199999999998s)]
*  veer toward the paint and decide like what to do off the dribble I always felt [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1169.54s)]
*  like he was better maybe that's what they're gonna have to do with Edwards [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1174.06s)]
*  and I thought they found something the first half of the go-bar pick and rolls [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1176.26s)]
*  and they just stopped there was a play in the second half where I don't remember [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1179.26s)]
*  exactly was an ant pick and roll maybe with go-bear and he got case and Wallace [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1184.06s)]
*  on his hip and got him trapped kind of behind him and then snaked it so he [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1188.1s)]
*  changed directions and it looked like he was gonna have a driving lane to the [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1192.98s)]
*  right and that if go-bear was the screener let's just say go-bear was [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1196.58s)]
*  gonna seal off everyone on the other side of the floor and Caruso just ran in [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1199.74s)]
*  from the right corner off Alexander Walker and it was like oh my god okay [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1205.18s)]
*  I'll kick the ball to Alexander Walker and in real time I thought they had [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1210.26s)]
*  switched and then I rewatched it it was like no Caruso just ran all the way back [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1214.0600000000002s)]
*  to Alexander Walker contested the three so Alexander Walker had to pump put the [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1218.26s)]
*  ball on the floor for one dribble rise up for a three and then here comes case [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1223.38s)]
*  and Wallace coming at me and it was like a decent three but it's an example of [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1226.8600000000001s)]
*  ant just couldn't get a like an easy feel for there's a clear path to the rim [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1231.06s)]
*  and I'm taking it and then they're just flying at you and making you take like [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1236.74s)]
*  some decent threes some bad threes so I just said there's a great I mean look [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1240.86s)]
*  it's not breaking news they're an awesome defensive team yeah well the [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1245.74s)]
*  problem if you're the other team that's playing whoever the favorite you kind of [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1249.8999999999999s)]
*  have to win game one I feel like to pull off an upset the Thunder were 68 and 14 [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1254.86s)]
*  this season they're eight and three in the playoffs now you have to beat them [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1260.26s)]
*  four to six times basically to send them packing and that includes winning at [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1264.66s)]
*  least one game on the road right and I guess game seven on the road just a tall [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1269.46s)]
*  task I thought this was the game they had to steal especially okay see [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1275.9s)]
*  definitely seem tired that first half Randall's playing great this is the game [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1280.34s)]
*  you probably take so I don't I don't really know in terms of tweaks I feel [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1284.02s)]
*  like it's gonna be easier for okay see to tweak this and use the you know the [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1290.3799999999999s)]
*  last quarter and a half to their advantage [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqCBEhM59uw&t=1294.94s)]
