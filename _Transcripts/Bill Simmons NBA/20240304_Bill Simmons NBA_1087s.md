# Can Anyone Else Score 40,000 Points Like LeBron James? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [March 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=0.0s)]
*  So LeBron gets 40,000 points. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=0.4s)]
*  And the question is, Roussillo, will anyone else do this in our lifetime? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=2.96s)]
*  No. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  I'm not willing to rule out Luca for this. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=13.72s)]
*  And I sent you, so I broke down the numbers in four quadrants of players and basketball [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=18.64s)]
*  reference, you can do this. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=27.04s)]
*  The most points people scored from ages 19 to 24, from 25 to 30, from 31 to 36, and then [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=28.72s)]
*  from 37 to 43. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=37.52s)]
*  And it was interesting because LeBron had the most points of anyone under 25 years old. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=39.36s)]
*  He had 12,993 and Durant was 700 behind him. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=46.56s)]
*  Luca had almost 11,000, but he's played less games for a variety of reasons. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=49.92s)]
*  So he is basically 2000 behind the LeBron pace heading into age 25. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=55.12s)]
*  From ages 25 to 30, LeBron is 16th for most points. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  A bunch of dudes in front of him. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=66.56s)]
*  Will, Hardin, Gerven, Malone, Wilkins. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=68.24s)]
*  He keeps going. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=70.64s)]
*  Ages 31 to 36, he climbs back up. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=72.4s)]
*  Now he's fourth again. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=74.88s)]
*  Kareem was third. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=77.28s)]
*  Carl Malone second. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=79.6s)]
*  And your number one leader for points ages 31 to 36, Alex English. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=81.2s)]
*  I wouldn't have guessed that in 20 tries, but that's who is the leader. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=86.8s)]
*  And then LeBron is now fourth for ages 37 to 43. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=90.72s)]
*  He's 2800 behind Kareem. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  So there's two things going on. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=97.44s)]
*  One is he's basically been 27 a game for 21 years and he's been really, really durable. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  Luca is averaging like 34 a game and I don't think he's as durable. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=106.0s)]
*  And I don't know if he'll care about his body in the same way, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=110.64s)]
*  but with scoring becoming easier as the years pass and the three point, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=113.92s)]
*  all these different things. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=120.4s)]
*  It's like if Luca averages 32 to 36 a game for like seven, eight years here, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=121.6s)]
*  I think he's going to be a little closer than people realize. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=128.16s)]
*  The difference is what we saw last night where LeBron's 39 years old and he still looks like [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=130.48s)]
*  a running back just flying through full speed and doing a lot of stuff that he wanted. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=136.24s)]
*  So I think Luca is the only one who has a chance is my long-winded point. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=141.27999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I was doing the math on a couple of different guys. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  It's more like I have to look at Anthony Edwards and just like, this is stupid. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=149.2s)]
*  Like I'm just going to stop, you know, because you start going, well, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  if he gets 2000 points a season for the next however many seasons, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  like actually most guys don't even hit 2000 points. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  Like 2000 points is a huge number. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=159.83999999999997s)]
*  Lucas hit 2000 points one time in his career. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=161.76s)]
*  He's going to hit it again this year. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=165.27999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=166.88s)]
*  So then you're like, okay, so now I got to start plugging in 1700, 1800 points per season. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=168.08s)]
*  And then you go, okay, cool. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=173.28s)]
*  So now the next 10 years, let's tack on 18,000 to your seven that you already have of your aunt. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  So like, okay, it's 25,000 when you're going to be in your early thirties. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=179.76s)]
*  And now all you have to do is score, score another 15,000. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=183.36s)]
*  29 in game basically. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=189.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=190.32s)]
*  So I don't know how anyone's going to have the longevity. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=190.96s)]
*  I think with scoring never being easier than it has been the last couple of years. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=194.56s)]
*  And I think this year is the, the apex of this. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=197.84s)]
*  I think it's to a point where I wonder if the NBA digs in a little bit deeper on some of the stuff. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=201.04000000000002s)]
*  I think both of us are starting to feel like they're going to actually address this, this summer. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=206.32s)]
*  There's going to be a couple of moves that they, I don't think they love this. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=210.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=214.72s)]
*  This is beyond now what, what was supposed to happen. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  You know, all of us were fine with the three point shooting and, and everything. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=218.56s)]
*  I just think there's a league wide frustration for get two guys on a podcast. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=223.04s)]
*  I'll just say this with a, a slight smirk on my face that I think the league in like, in its entirety [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=227.44s)]
*  would, would rather some of this stuff be cleaned up where the offensive player can [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=236.8s)]
*  literally do whatever he wants now and get to the free throw line. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=240.72s)]
*  So they can make it a priority. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=243.04s)]
*  They can say they're going to change it. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=245.76s)]
*  Then it's like, okay, it's March of next season. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=247.04s)]
*  I think Joe Dumars, I think half of the texts that he gets are clips of offensive players [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=249.52s)]
*  creating some sort of fake foul from one of the 30 coaches or GMs. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=255.2s)]
*  I think they just send them to do Mars now. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=259.6s)]
*  Hey Joe, check out Trey young. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=262.8s)]
*  Hey Joe, check out this Jalen Brunson play. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=265.84s)]
*  Hey Joe, look at, look at this Malik Monk push off. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=269.12s)]
*  Like this is Joe Dumars his life right now. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=273.28s)]
*  Something's going on. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=276.24s)]
*  I would agree. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=277.12s)]
*  I think, I think we're in agreement on that one. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=278.72s)]
*  So, you know, is the free throw rates going to stay the same? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=280.56s)]
*  And if you look at Lucas free throw rates, he's, I mean, last year he was at 48%. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=283.44s)]
*  So he was getting a free throw attempt. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=292.0s)]
*  It was for every, every two shots, he was getting a free throw attempt. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=296.24s)]
*  Just about every two shots. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=302.32s)]
*  He was getting a free throw attempt. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=303.84s)]
*  Just, you know, who could have, who could have really challenged his 40,000? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=306.64s)]
*  I was looking at it was Kobe and it set me down this rabbit hole of Kobe's 2013 [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=310.64s)]
*  season when he lost his mind and he started playing 48 minutes every game, which was [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  insane as it was happening. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=322.32s)]
*  Like literally it was insane. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=323.76s)]
*  I was doing TV that year and we were like, and everyone was like, this is amazing. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=325.28s)]
*  This guy's a word. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=329.52s)]
*  And it's like, this is insane. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=330.32s)]
*  He's going to get hurt. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=331.52s)]
*  And then he blew out his Achilles. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=332.4s)]
*  But that next season, he only played six games. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=334.23999999999995s)]
*  And then the season after that, he only played 35. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=337.84s)]
*  And remember he got hurt in the second to last game of the season in 2013. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=341.44s)]
*  So if he just doesn't get hurt and then he plays instead of 41 games, plays. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=346.88s)]
*  I don't know, 140. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=352.71999999999997s)]
*  He ended up with 33,643 points. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=355.2s)]
*  He probably left a hundred. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=359.03999999999996s)]
*  He left another 3000 on the table when he got hurt. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=360.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=364.32s)]
*  And then maybe he stays on and keeps going for it. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  And he was never really the same after he hurt his Achilles, but just him refusing [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=368.0s)]
*  to come out of games ended up like being the reason he got 40,000 points. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=372.15999999999997s)]
*  I remember doing segments when we were like kind of mapping out how Kobe was going to [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=375.76s)]
*  get to 40,000 points and be cream and all that stuff. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=381.12s)]
*  This was a topic in 2013 and then it was over. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=384.32s)]
*  LeBron just never had the major injury. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=387.44s)]
*  That was one of the secrets of his success. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=389.28s)]
*  Kobe shot. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=392.47999999999996s)]
*  Oh, you're looking. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  See, I did this last night. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=394.96s)]
*  I was dying. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  Every game is like 47 minutes, 48 minutes, 43 minutes. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=397.84s)]
*  Well, the season you're talking about where he played the full, he averaged 39 minutes [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=402.79999999999995s)]
*  a game, but you're right. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=407.11999999999995s)]
*  Baked in there were games where he was like, I'm just staying out here. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=408.55999999999995s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=411.35999999999996s)]
*  The last 10 or 11 games, I think he averaged like 42 minutes a game. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=412.0s)]
*  This was his age 34 season, but he had been in the league for 17 years at that point. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=419.67999999999995s)]
*  It was amazing when it was happening in real time. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=424.32s)]
*  He hated Dwight Howard so much. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=426.47999999999996s)]
*  He was just like, I'm never coming out. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=428.0s)]
*  I'm just staying in. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=430.55999999999995s)]
*  Well, because I brought it up with the, you know, LeBron looking for like a three year [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=431.59999999999997s)]
*  160 deal, opt out of the player option, re-signed three years 160. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=436.08s)]
*  And I brought up, you know, from what? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=441.2s)]
*  Over 10 years ago, we were all still working at ESPN. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=443.52s)]
*  And then Kobe had, he was going to be a free agent after the 14th [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=446.72s)]
*  season where he played only six games, but clearly they didn't want to lose him. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=451.92s)]
*  So they gave him what? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=455.52s)]
*  The two year deal. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=456.24s)]
*  48.5. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=456.96s)]
*  And the whole point was, I remember Jeannie Buss being like, we want stars to know that [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=459.04s)]
*  we take care of stars with the Lakers. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=464.72s)]
*  Yeah, the rant didn't even have a meeting. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=467.12s)]
*  So I just wonder if LeBron goes back to them and says, okay, I'm going to opt out, but [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=469.52000000000004s)]
*  like, I want, I want the same love. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=476.96000000000004s)]
*  I want that to happen for me. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=479.36s)]
*  And considering like every time with LeBron, like I feel guilty about anything that I'm [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=481.68s)]
*  critical of with him because watching him last night put together the offensive game [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=485.36s)]
*  that he does, keeping you in it, you know, being the number one option, like what he [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=490.48s)]
*  did against the Clippers, you can call it fluke, but that's ridiculous. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=494.24s)]
*  What he did to that team in the fourth quarter, like it's all on me again. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=498.8s)]
*  And he hasn't even had the time off that he usually like, he'll usually have a stretch [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=503.04s)]
*  if you go back the last four or five seasons where he's not available. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=506.96000000000004s)]
*  So that hasn't even happened. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=510.0s)]
*  So then you start factoring that into like, what are the Lakers going to look like in [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=511.44s)]
*  the playoffs? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=514.4s)]
*  And it's like, man, he'd probably be better off like getting a couple of weeks. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=514.88s)]
*  And when you look at the way the West is playing out, like all these teams are playing [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=518.4s)]
*  like a little bit harder because they don't have their own draft pick. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=523.52s)]
*  There's a bunch of teams this year. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=526.0s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=528.72s)]
*  You're a 500 team with them right now. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=531.28s)]
*  You're going to give them three more years, 160. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=533.28s)]
*  You're also, you just gave Davis a giant extension. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=535.52s)]
*  I wouldn't do it. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=538.24s)]
*  You're locking down the foundation of those two guys with a bunch of role players around [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=539.28s)]
*  them, which we're finding out year after year, it's impossible to put the right role [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=544.4s)]
*  players when you're spending a hundred million dollars on two guys. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=547.76s)]
*  And those two guys are the foundation of a 500 team. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=550.88s)]
*  I think it'd be insane to do it, but I know they're going to do it. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=554.64s)]
*  You, you, you basically have no chance at the title if you're going to do it and he's [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=559.68s)]
*  going to get older every year. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=563.12s)]
*  And at some point the performance is going to decline. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=564.16s)]
*  I just wonder why you go, well, look, you're not going to go to Utah. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=566.72s)]
*  You're not going to go to Detroit. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=570.16s)]
*  You're probably not going to go to Philadelphia. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=572.4s)]
*  They're going to back out. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=574.0s)]
*  There's no way they're not going to give it to them. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=575.6s)]
*  Why can't they just be like, can we give you, can we give you three for a hundred? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=578.56s)]
*  Can we do three for 90? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=582.8s)]
*  Like, why do we have to pay you 60 million? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=584.4s)]
*  This is the Kobe Bryant thing from 10 years ago where he's like, I'm not taking a pay cut. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=586.4s)]
*  Fuck that. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=590.88s)]
*  I've been filling this place. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=591.3599999999999s)]
*  I remember writing about this for Grantland. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=593.04s)]
*  On the one hand, it was selfish because he was ruining their chance to put a good team [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=597.5999999999999s)]
*  around him. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=601.3599999999999s)]
*  But on the other hand, he was right. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=602.16s)]
*  He had increased the value of the team. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=603.8399999999999s)]
*  They were selling jerseys and tickets and he was the face and the marquee guy on the [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=606.0s)]
*  franchise. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=610.0s)]
*  He was like, I'm not taking a pay cut. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=611.04s)]
*  There were people out there. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=613.92s)]
*  And he actually did. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=614.48s)]
*  He actually did. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=615.28s)]
*  Based on what the number was before that extension. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=616.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it was like slight. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=618.56s)]
*  It was very slight. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=619.76s)]
*  He was making a giant number. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=620.9599999999999s)]
*  The number itself, the 48 and a half million guaranteed when he was hurt and you were like, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=622.7199999999999s)]
*  wait, what? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=628.48s)]
*  What are they doing? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=630.4s)]
*  Do you think Brady regrets taking cheaper deals from that cheapskate craft? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=631.1999999999999s)]
*  I would tell you there was probably some nights where he looked at the depth chart of the [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=637.6s)]
*  receivers. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=641.5200000000001s)]
*  I was like, what am I doing? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=642.8000000000001s)]
*  Where was it? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=643.6s)]
*  Yeah, they were. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=644.24s)]
*  What am I doing? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=645.0400000000001s)]
*  The patch spent. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=645.76s)]
*  They were 30 second in spending for the last 10 years. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=647.0400000000001s)]
*  And yet we had this alleged amazing deal with Brady where he was sacrificing to put the [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=649.84s)]
*  money back in the team. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=656.48s)]
*  But then they really didn't. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=657.36s)]
*  Not it not going to be in the documentary. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=660.1600000000001s)]
*  The documentary that pinned Aaron Hernandez's murder on Bill Bellagio. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=662.6400000000001s)]
*  Bill Belichick in episode six. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=666.64s)]
*  Man wouldn't be dead. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=670.3199999999999s)]
*  Have you done like the real breakdown of this? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=671.8399999999999s)]
*  Because I don't. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=676.16s)]
*  I want to do a I want to come on your podcast as a guest and just do a special breakdown [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=677.1999999999999s)]
*  of dynasty. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=682.4s)]
*  I haven't watched it. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=684.8s)]
*  By the way, I want there to be a chief's version of this in 2040 where every episode is about [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=685.76s)]
*  something awful that happened during this chief's run. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=692.0799999999999s)]
*  And I'm not going to list all the terrible things, but they're pretty easy to figure [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=694.24s)]
*  out. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=697.12s)]
*  But that's the equivalent of this. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=697.6800000000001s)]
*  They did a whole episode on Brady's ACL. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=699.44s)]
*  They did a whole episode on his torn ACL. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=702.32s)]
*  The 2008 season they spent 20 minutes on. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=705.04s)]
*  They skipped over two Super Bowls in the 21 game win streak, but spent 20 minutes on [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=708.8s)]
*  the 2008 season where they didn't make the playoffs for reasons that remain unclear. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=713.28s)]
*  Who funded this? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=717.2s)]
*  Johnson. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=717.92s)]
*  Did Hernandez episode in a spy gate episode? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=719.92s)]
*  It's like, what is this? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=723.1999999999999s)]
*  Anyway, I think with the Lakers, if I was a Laker fan, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=725.12s)]
*  this is the roughest spot to this is basically where the Celtics were in 2013 with KG and [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=732.48s)]
*  Pearson, those guys where you're locking down past performance, past memories versus any [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=737.28s)]
*  chance to actually win the title. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=744.8s)]
*  So I guess the question for the Lakers is what do you care about more? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=746.3199999999999s)]
*  Do you care about building a new team around Davis or do you care about just, this is one [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=749.28s)]
*  of the great athletes we've ever had in any team sport and he wants to finish his career [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=754.72s)]
*  here. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=758.8s)]
*  So we're getting a lot of money. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=758.9599999999999s)]
*  History tells us they're going to pay. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=762.72s)]
*  They're going to pay him, but it'd be the wrong basketball decision. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=765.1999999999999s)]
*  Despite him moving, moving the line of expectations of what we even think is possible, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=770.4s)]
*  because watching him live this many times in this short period of time, like, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=776.8000000000001s)]
*  once he gets going, it's still. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=783.6s)]
*  The head of steam that he still has at this age is pretty crazy. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=787.5200000000001s)]
*  It'll do it like three times a game where it just turns the jets on and it's like, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=792.0s)]
*  and nobody's getting in front of him still, which is the same thing that was the case 15 years ago. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=796.4000000000001s)]
*  I realized this last night, Russo Love. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=802.08s)]
*  Kyle, I don't think you necessarily have to turn on the TikTok camera here, but maybe, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=803.76s)]
*  maybe think about it. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=807.2s)]
*  I think Yoke Edge is the best player I've seen in person [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=810.08s)]
*  since LeBron that third year in Miami. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=816.16s)]
*  It's been 11 years since I've seen a player in person as good as Yoke Edge. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=820.56s)]
*  That third heat season when LeBron was like, we were wondering if he was going to shoot 60% [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=825.92s)]
*  and he was just athletically still at like the peak, peak, peak of his powers. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=830.08s)]
*  I'd put him way up there. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=834.24s)]
*  I would put 2000 Shack. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=835.44s)]
*  There's probably the 06 Kobe, which I saw a couple of times that year when he was just like, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=840.4000000000001s)]
*  I can't believe that my team's this bad. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=845.2s)]
*  I'm just shooting every time, but it was amazing to watch. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=847.12s)]
*  And Duncan in the early 2000s, who always gets, who just gets lost now because he's not on TV [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=850.72s)]
*  and doesn't promote himself. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=856.48s)]
*  There was a Duncan year when he came in and just like annihilated the Celtics once. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=857.84s)]
*  I don't remember what year it was, but it was like, Jesus, not only we lose the lottery [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=861.68s)]
*  and not get this guy, but this is happening. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=866.88s)]
*  So anyway, since that LeBron season, I think this is the best I've seen. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=870.4s)]
*  I despise the MJ LeBron political parties. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=876.08s)]
*  Me too. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=880.72s)]
*  It's like, I'll agree with one of the other players, but I think it's the best I've seen. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=881.84s)]
*  I'll agree with one of the arguments and then want to disagree just for getting physically ill [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=886.4s)]
*  of how terrible the argument is crafted. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=893.84s)]
*  Even if I agree with the general mission statement of it all. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=896.88s)]
*  I'm thinking of starting a Duncan only feed because I'm getting really upset about where [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=900.16s)]
*  Tim Duncan is just getting knocked down historically in comparison with all these other guys that we see. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=906.88s)]
*  I start on seventh. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=913.28s)]
*  The highlight videos just aren't going to be as cool kids, but clearly he was doing something right. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=914.8s)]
*  Tim Duncan was a problem. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=920.24s)]
*  Where are those videos? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=921.8399999999999s)]
*  They don't exist. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=923.28s)]
*  I'm trying to think of what would be the latest thing you could put that would still work where [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=925.04s)]
*  kids today don't have any idea. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=930.0s)]
*  Could you do an Eric Bledsoe Clippers run? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=933.92s)]
*  Kids don't have any idea. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=939.5999999999999s)]
*  Quentin Richardson was a problem. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=940.64s)]
*  Eric Bledsoe pick and roll ball handler efficiency. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=942.4s)]
*  Checkout synergy. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=945.92s)]
*  Kids don't know anything. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=946.72s)]
*  What would you say on Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter, the percentage of [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=949.92s)]
*  white chocolate was a problem versus Tim Duncan was a problem videos? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=954.8s)]
*  It's probably 10 to one white chocolate. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=958.64s)]
*  All of us enjoyed the white chocolate thing. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=962.3199999999999s)]
*  All of us enjoyed it. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=964.3199999999999s)]
*  It was adorable. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=965.36s)]
*  It was so much fun for a little while. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=966.16s)]
*  And then he did something recently who was like, man, if I played today, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=969.28s)]
*  I want one guy to be like, yeah, I actually couldn't shoot that well. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=973.84s)]
*  They'd probably ignore it. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=977.36s)]
*  It would have been trouble. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=978.16s)]
*  Back then you didn't have to shoot as well, but now everybody shoots well. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=980.24s)]
*  I just didn't shoot it well enough. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=983.28s)]
*  So they'd sag off of me and then it would screw up all of our other actions and screens and stuff. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=984.48s)]
*  They just ignore me. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=989.4399999999999s)]
*  So yeah, I actually played in a better era then than today. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=990.64s)]
*  Just being honest. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=996.72s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=998.08s)]
*  So to answer the question, I think Luca at least has a puncher's chance of 40k, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=998.32s)]
*  but I would put the odds at 15 to one. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=1005.6s)]
*  And you think there's no chance we will not see in our lifetime? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=1009.2800000000001s)]
*  I don't. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=1014.08s)]
*  I don't think we will. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=1015.2s)]
*  I think LeBron to his credit is chasing something that no one else is really going to be chasing. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=1017.6s)]
*  I don't know if we're going to be lucky enough to have somebody show up in our lifetime that's [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=1025.04s)]
*  going to at least be chasing Michael Jordan, because that's how special LeBron is. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=1032.32s)]
*  To sit here and just write it off and say, all right, in the next 30 years of watching hoops, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=1037.76s)]
*  we're not going to get one player. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=1042.8s)]
*  That's a pretty big assumption. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=1044.08s)]
*  Maybe it's the wrong assumption. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=1046.48s)]
*  You could also say, well, with medicine and guys and on and on and on, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=1049.12s)]
*  and they're going to play longer. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=1053.2s)]
*  We've seen it with the quarterbacks and we're seeing it with LeBron now. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=1054.32s)]
*  But I think LeBron is motivated by something almost every other player [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=1057.2s)]
*  isn't going to be motivated by chasing Michael Jordan. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=1060.6399999999999s)]
*  As I've told you, I thought the last dance had an impact on him. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=1065.2s)]
*  When we're on COVID and we're all locked up and it's 10 straight weeks [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=1069.9199999999998s)]
*  or five straight weeks of how unbelievable Michael Jordan was. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFbJajZGaqQ&t=1073.04s)]
