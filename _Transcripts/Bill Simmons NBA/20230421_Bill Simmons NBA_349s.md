# Was It Too Soon to Write Off Russell Westbrook? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLIdoJzdaNg)
*  I've never seen anything like this Westbrook thing.
*  Kyle Mann and I talked about it on Tuesday and I was like,
*  this honestly reminds me of Travolta in Pulp Fiction.
*  Like I thought you were dead.
*  I thought your career was over and you were gonna be,
*  you know, on CW shows and now you're in this amazing movie
*  and now you're headlining movies again.
*  What happened?
*  Westbrook, the athleticism and intensity
*  and it's the whole Westbrook package,
*  but it really seems like 2016 era Westbrook
*  he's taking guys off the dribble.
*  He's got that ferocity at the end of the games.
*  You see when he cheap shot at Durant
*  and when they were doing the fouls and he just.
*  I didn't even see that.
*  He kind of did the undercut him and Durant was like,
*  what the fuck dude, game was over.
*  He was 11 for 23 tonight, he had 12 assists,
*  he had eight rebounds.
*  He did not seem tired at any point.
*  And it's just like, I've never seen a rejuvenation
*  like this from a guy that we thought was gonna be
*  like in China in a year.
*  It's been incredible.
*  And it's not just offensively as you're saying,
*  the burst, the explosion, the activity.
*  A lot of it's defensively too.
*  And I'm sure there are a lot of folks in Houston,
*  in OKC, in Washington, certainly Lakers fans
*  or people with that organization thinking
*  you could have been doing this the whole time.
*  You could have been this defender the whole time,
*  contesting every shot from behind,
*  not giving up on a single play in the mix everywhere.
*  And in particular, the fact that he can credibly
*  at any point guard Kevin Durant in this series,
*  what is, wasn't, what an unimaginable thought
*  a couple of months ago.
*  And yet he has that like former teammate who knows
*  all of your stuff dynamic, but amplified by enough
*  pettiness to power the sun, right?
*  Like that is an amazing matchup to zoom in and watch.
*  The way he's just able to push Katie out,
*  get his dribble, time his stuff.
*  Russ has been incredible defensively and offensively,
*  especially in a game like this,
*  you would think without Kawhi to stabilize it,
*  are they gonna go completely off the rails
*  if they have to rely on Westbrook?
*  Nope, they had some early turnovers, but they cleaned it up.
*  He looked great, Powell looked great.
*  The Clippers looked like the deepest team in the league.
*  He bully balled Westbrook a couple times.
*  I mean, Booker a couple times in the second half.
*  Yeah.
*  Like grown man shit.
*  And I was like, oh man, you can still do this?
*  I was thinking about his career.
*  I obviously am not a huge Westbrook guy,
*  but I've respected always how hard he plays.
*  But really since that 2016 season with the KD,
*  the last OKC season, he's always been like the guy
*  in the wrong movie.
*  You have like the movie star,
*  it's like when Nick Cage had that run of weird
*  Nick Cage movies and then he kind of eventually
*  found his Nick Cage level water.
*  You're gonna need to be more specific on the run
*  of weird Nick Cage movies.
*  Well, he's had this kind of comeback, right?
*  Where people kind of know who Nick Cage is now.
*  He's an OKC as like a, as the main guy,
*  which is great for his stats,
*  but you're not winning anything with that.
*  Goes to Washington, same thing.
*  You're gonna be basically a 500 team and an eight seed.
*  The Houston, which was before the Washington,
*  just a weird fit with Harden, too high usage guys.
*  And then goes to the Lakers.
*  And you see this version of him now in the Quippers,
*  you're like, oh, this never would have worked
*  on the Lakers.
*  Nobody freelances ad libs is a wild card on the LeBron team.
*  It's just never worked.
*  LeBron likes, you know, he likes to have the ball.
*  There's a set thing.
*  He likes certain type of guys and it was a horrible fit,
*  but I think it was such a bad fit.
*  It made a lot of us just think he's done.
*  It's over.
*  That's it.
*  And he's clearly not done.
*  Athletically, when you think like he's 2008 draft,
*  think of the other guys in that draft.
*  Kevin Love, his hair is the color of mine.
*  Derrick Rose is almost out of the league.
*  All those guys in that draft are basically done.
*  And he looks like he's 25.
*  Might have to make him pee in a cup, Rob.
*  You know what, I'm gonna give him the benefit of the doubt
*  and say sometimes this is what it looks like
*  when you're wanted, right?
*  The situation with the Lakers was so toxic.
*  Coming into the Clippers, it was complicated too,
*  but he had Paul George really vouching for him,
*  going on a limb saying, this guy can help us.
*  And you know what, for all the shit PG took,
*  he was 100% right.
*  And guys like you and I are gonna have to eat it on that.
*  I was out here saying, like, are you giving up, you know,
*  Terrence Mann minutes for Russell Westbrook?
*  Could not have been more wrong.
*  He's been exemplary all throughout this series,
*  even when he's barely making a shot.
*  He makes a huge difference.
*  And you think like situation, part of this situation is
*  you gotta earn your minutes or you're not gonna play.
*  He's got a massive chip on his shoulder.
*  He's in LA, same city as LeBron
*  and the team that gave up on him
*  and the guy that tried to trade him
*  for eight months basically.
*  And you know, I'm sure he's thinking down the road,
*  like, man, if I could just play the Lakers
*  in a playoff series.
*  I mean, that might be the most crazy high energy performance
*  we've seen in a Western or Eastern finals,
*  Westbrook against the Lakers.
*  I actually think it would be like watching a car
*  where the RPMs are like at eight
*  and you're like, this engine's just gonna blow.
*  Take your foot off the pedal.
*  Like he might lose his mind.
*  The other really interesting thing about the game today,
*  at least, was all their trade deadline moves
*  were like prominently involved, right?
*  Bones Allen, Eric Gordon's been what we expected
*  as a playoff guy all series.
*  He wasn't great today,
*  but you at least feel comfortable with the bad hair.
*  But Bones had a really good, you know, what he'll do,
*  the wild card game, Westbrook, and then Plumlee played too.
*  That's three of the five guards in that small lineup, right?
*  Like those are all guys who weren't even on the team
*  a few months ago.
