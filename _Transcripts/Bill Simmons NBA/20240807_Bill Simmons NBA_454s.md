# Are the Nuggets in Real Trouble?  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [August 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZNd-A1iGCo)
*  I feel so much worse about Denver than I did two months ago.
*  You know, they lose KCP.
*  Murray's just looked just, I mean, he's the talking point now, the entire
*  Olympics, like what happened to that dude?
*  And you go back to his playoffs versus 2023 and the 31% three point shooting
*  in the playoffs this last year is not getting to the line in the same way.
*  No.
*  And you were talking about the side by side of pulling up old Jason Tatum
*  tape and comparison it to now.
*  If you are a nuggets fan, do not do this with Jamal Murray.
*  He does not move the same.
*  He doesn't navigate the floor the same.
*  Everything mechanically.
*  Absolutely not.
*  Like the idea of him as a finisher around the rim, he was a guy who was
*  challenging, like maybe not prime LeBron, but still like gently post prime LeBron
*  at the apex, dunking over him.
*  That was who Jamal Murray was.
*  That seems unfathomable right now.
*  He was 27 a game in 23.
*  He seemed like he was his generation's big game guard that was just going to be
*  in all these playoffs doing stuff.
*  And maybe it'll come back.
*  Maybe there, there's some injury we don't know about.
*  Maybe he's a little out of shape, but Canada was playing for their
*  life today and they lost.
*  Yeah.
*  And he wasn't out there.
*  So you take that piece.
*  You take the fact that the West is better.
*  And you know, as, as, as a giant Yoke-age fan, I'm, I'm concerned.
*  I just think like, like what happens there are weaker team and Murray's
*  worse and the West is better.
*  Why would I feel great about this season?
*  Pub the nuggets.
*  Like they, to me, they look like a clear, a clear under and Murray will see,
*  will this, will this inspire something?
*  Is this some sort of, Hey man, I got to look in the mirror, but you're
*  losing minutes to Dylan Brooks when Dylan Brooks is one for nine and whipping,
*  whipping bricks off the backboard in a must win game.
*  That's embarrassing.
*  I think if there isn't under to hit on the nuggets, it should probably be hit.
*  They, the lesson of last season for them, it seemed like internally was they pushed
*  too hard to stay in that race for the number one seed and it ended up costing
*  them in terms of energy.
*  They just felt depleted.
*  KCP even said that he thought they probably should have lost that
*  series to the Lakers, which fair point.
*  They had to come back and basically all of those games.
*  I heard that.
*  I thought that was stupid.
*  I mean, the Lakers, the Lakers, the Lakers, the Lakers, the Lakers,
*  the Lakers couldn't close in fourth quarters for two years.
*  Like they were, they were one team for the first three quarters, another team
*  for the last quarter, and that's who they were.
*  But at the point where you're having to make 20 point comebacks to win, I
*  understand that part of his point.
*  That part of it is a bad sign.
*  And to me as an Oman, they will take this upcoming regular season a bit more slowly
*  as if honestly, as if they had a choice without KCP, they're going to have to
*  play younger guys, Julian Strother.
*  Guess what?
*  You're going to have to get real rotation minutes.
*  You're into the fire.
*  You know, like Peyton Watson, these guys are going to have to actually get
*  minutes and Michael Malone against all of his instincts is going to have to trust
*  some of these guys and find ways to trust them and find ways to invest in them.
*  The result of that might be that in the long game, they're a little younger and
*  a little more athletic.
*  And maybe some of those guys hit in the regular season, they're just not going
*  to win as many games.
*  And with Phoenix as a contrast, Phoenix won 49 games last season.
*  They just brought in, as you said, Mike Budenholzer, a great regular season
*  coach who is going to help them win more games.
*  And they actually have point guards.
*  I, I would be very surprised even with all of their injury concerns.
*  If Phoenix doesn't wind up in the mid fifties, that's just where I am penciling
*  them in at this point.
*  And the case against them is Durant year 18 with real miles and real injury miles
*  on them.
*  What do you think Denver is over under is on FanDuel?
*  Just out of curiosity.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  47 wins.
*  Yeah.
*  So I thought it was going to be like 48, 49 right now.
*  It's 51 and a half.
*  51 and a half.
*  Yeah.
*  That's just, to me, that is an absolute, uh, absolute oversight in a conference.
*  It's like 13 deep.
*  Yeah.
*  So then you go West Western conference odds right now.
*  Okay.
*  See Minnesota, Dallas, Denver's fourth.
*  Um, okay.
*  See, he's the leader at three to one.
*  Yeah.
*  Phoenix is fifth.
*  The Lakers at 18 to one or six.
*  I'll book all the Lakers action.
*  If anyone wants to make Lakers conference, that's, uh, Pelicans, Grizzlies,
*  21.
*  Where are the Grizzlies?
*  They're eighth, 21 to one.
*  Give me that over.
*  Yeah.
*  The Grizzlies are going to win more games than the Nuggets.
*  I'm with you.
*  I'm with you.
*  Can I throw, I thought about this.
*  Admittedly, I overrated international basketball and the connections of players.
*  Like I was telling Saruti yesterday, like, I just don't know how Orlando
*  doesn't have Schroeder, like just go get him.
*  He plays with the Wagner's.
*  Go get him in Banga.
*  Just go get four Germans.
*  Become the German national team.
*  Yeah.
*  Just get four Germans.
*  They all play great together.
*  I never understood why teams didn't do this with Spain in the late 2000s, early
*  2010s, like Schroeder's great with those guys.
*  Orlando doesn't really have a point card, but I was thinking the same thing with
*  Denver because the out for Denver is a Michael Porter trade.
*  So I know it's summer vacation, but Picasso is still, he's still painting the
*  trade machine every once in a while.
*  But I was thinking like Porter three years left, pretty sizable.
*  Like he's in the high thirties.
*  He's in the forties.
*  Bogdanovich on Atlanta, who Yocage plays really well with, who can do a little
*  like discount Murray with Yocage moving off the picks and he didn't have a great
*  game today, but he knows how to do it.
*  Bogdanovich and Deandre Hunter for Porter.
*  Cool.
*  Who says no?
*  Maybe both.
*  A double no.
*  I think it might be a double no.
*  I think it might be a double hangup.
*  I think if you're the Hawks Porter's, I know he's coming off of a very healthy
*  season, but I think in a larger sense is still an injury risk and frankly, as, as
*  more of a primary option, we haven't really seen it and I don't know if I would
*  really trust it.
*  I like his role in Denver.
*  I think that's probably what he's best suited to do.
*  Maybe a little more creation than that, but ultimately he needs someone like
*  Yocage to play off of.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know that I feel that way about Trey Young.
*  What about, how about, all right, let me make the case for Atlanta.
*  Yeah.
*  We just took Risa Shea, six foot nine.
*  They certainly did.
*  That's the thing that they did for offensive in theory, playmaking forward.
*  Now we get Porter Jr.
*  Six foot 10.
*  Okay.
*  Playmaking forward.
*  Now we got little size of the forwards with our guards and they need to make a
*  two for one anyway.
*  That's what I was thinking, but I don't know if that's the right move for Denver,
*  but it's something like that where I think they're going to have to split
*  Porter and get two guys out of it.
*  Cause I don't, I just don't think they're going to have enough with the way the
*  league's gone.
*  The league's too deep.
*  You, you need like seven, seven really good spots at this point and they don't
*  have it.
*  That is the natural trajectory, but it depends on Jamal Murray being Jamal
*  Murray, because if your core is Yocage and Aaron Gordon, who's a really good
*  player, but somewhat limited as a score in certain matchups and this version of
*  Jamal Murray, that's just not enough offense.
*  Like you need Porter's explosion in those circumstances in ways that it's,
*  it's a precarious place to be.
*  This is bad, man.
*  Yocage is, he's important.
*  He's, you know, he's, he's like a big diamond in the safe.
*  We've got to take care of this dude.
*  The good news is that Denver.
*  I don't want him to be on like half-ass teams that aren't very good.
