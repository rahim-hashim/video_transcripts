# Embiid’s Lack of Self-Awareness + More NBA Major Storylines  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [July 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmrbxqzNPIM)
*  Brought to you by Michelob Ultra, the official beer sponsor of Team USA, who we're about
*  to talk about.
*  Win or lose, you're bound to enjoy the ride with a good beer in hand.
*  And Michelob Ultra is good beer.
*  It's crisp, light, refreshing, only 95 calories.
*  Order yourself an Ultra six pack while we unpack.
*  Six major things going on in the world of basketball right now.
*  Five of them for me involve Team USA.
*  Okay, here we go.
*  All right, so the big thing I love with the Olympics, and we get this every four years,
*  and you basically get to go back, you can go back to the games they played in 08 and
*  12 and 16 and 21 and now this year.
*  The hierarchy of the team.
*  You know I love this stuff.
*  This is, this is my jam.
*  There's usually three indispensable on the team that emerge and one like pivotal proven
*  bench guy, which is basically you think of it as the mellow Wade spot and it was Tatum
*  in 21.
*  But what happens is they can talk all they want 10 guys, 12 guys, everybody's going
*  to play.
*  Everybody's playing 20 minutes, but there's always a game when all of a sudden, holy shit,
*  we need to win this.
*  And then the minutes start to resemble an actual structure of an NBA game.
*  When you think about like there's 200 minutes total in international game, you can only
*  play five guys.
*  The most anybody could play is 40 minutes.
*  So if you go back, the four biggest games they've played since 08, which was the 08
*  gold medal game, USA 118, Spain 107 and LeBron, Wade, Kobe, CP3 and Bosch are all in the 20s
*  for minutes.
*  Mello Howard and Darren Williams are the are the first three kid plays 11 Prince plays
*  eight.
*  Boozer and red get DMP.
*  So already two guys are just out when it really comes to nut crunch time, two or three guys
*  are getting pushed out.
*  2012 gold medal, USA 107, Spain 100.
*  KD plays 38 minutes, which was an amazing year for KD.
*  It's 2012 finals.
*  He feels like he's going to be an MVP at some point really soon.
*  Even though LeBron is the best guy in the league.
*  KD plays 38 to the 40 minutes.
*  They basically can't keep him out of this game.
*  CP3 29, LeBron 29 and got in a little foul trouble.
*  And I was at this game and we were just sitting there in the fourth quarter.
*  LeBron's at the bench.
*  They can't stop the game.
*  And we're sitting there having a heart attack because they can't get LeBron back in the
*  game.
*  And then we had a guy who was like kind of like old man Kobe at that point.
*  It was like, ah, we're going to lean on him when we need him.
*  And he ends up playing 26, the fourth most minutes.
*  Mello plays 21.
*  Kevin Love plays 18 and plays crunch time against the Gasals down the stretch.
*  And then for the bench, it was Williams.
*  Westbrook played nine minutes.
*  Chandler played eight.
*  Iguodala Harden, Davis barely played.
*  So they really went nine guys, but really it was, it was six.
*  2016 semifinal game was the big game that year.
*  USA 82, Spain 76.
*  You know who made, who played the most minutes that game?
*  Clay Thompson, 35 minutes out of the 40.
*  KD played 30.
*  And then DeAndre Jordan, I bet you didn't have him in your big go card.
*  He played 27.
*  Mello 25, Kyrie 24.
*  And then George, Lowry, Butler and Cousins were the bench.
*  Draymond Green and DeRozan basically got bumped.
*  So that was that.
*  And then 21 was the most recent one three years ago.
*  USA 87, France 82 in the gold medal game.
*  KD once again, the greatest Olympic player we've had.
*  35 minutes plays the most.
*  Drew Holliday was the second best player that year.
*  He played 29.
*  They had kind of a hodgepodge that year because Dame, Bam, Booker, Tatum, they never knew
*  what they were expecting from these guys.
*  So Dame, Bam, Booker and Tatum were all in the 20s.
*  Green, Zach Levin, Middleton, 16, 14 and 10 minutes.
*  And then JaVale McGee, Jeremy Grant, Kelden Johnson did not play.
*  So the point is you have the indispensable.
*  The indispensable is an 08.
*  Kobe, LeBron, Mello weighed off the bench.
*  2012, KD, LeBron, CP3, Mello off the bench.
*  2016, KD, Clay, DeAndre Jordan, Mello off the bench.
*  2021, KD and Drew are the only indispensable Tatum off the bench and then hodgepodge depending
*  on who looked good.
*  This brings me to 2024.
*  Who are the indispensable?
*  LeBron, Curry and Anthony Davis.
*  I think that's our three and Tatum in that Mello weighed bench spot and then probably
*  Drew Holliday as the glue guy, defensive guard, shut down person, just kind of do everything.
*  I think those are the five guys that get the most minutes.
*  So the most interesting thing about that to me is the LeBron piece because heading
*  into the Olympics, I didn't know if it was going to be LeBron.
*  We're so happy for you to be here.
*  You and Curry are the faces of the team.
*  Maybe we'll bring you off the bench as a six man.
*  Maybe you'll start.
*  You'll play 20 minutes, a little like Kobe in 2012.
*  It's not like that at all.
*  They've given him the car keys.
*  He's the point forward of this team.
*  You can see it against South Sudan.
*  He's the point forward.
*  Curry's playing off him.
*  Steve Kerr basically is using LeBron in this crazy 19.0 version of Draymond Green where
*  he's using him a little like how he uses Draymond, but with the added bonus that LeBron can
*  shoot and he's one of the three greatest players of all time and he's the leading scorer in
*  points in NBA history.
*  So you have that, but you also have all the stuff you can still do with Curry and Draymond,
*  but you just do it through LeBron.
*  And then Davis is the other indispensable guy, which leads me to my second thing in
*  this six pack.
*  Anthony Davis versus Embiid.
*  Embiid won an MVP.
*  Anthony Davis has never won an MVP.
*  Davis won the 2020 title and was in the mix there for finals MVP, but LeBron had an awesome
*  finals.
*  He made the 2023 Eastern Conference Finals as well.
*  Embiid has lost six of his last nine playoff series.
*  Embiid has never played 12 playoff games in a postseason.
*  Embiid has never played 70 games in a season.
*  Embiid has played 433 games in the last 10 years.
*  Davis has missed the playoffs six times.
*  Davis has either been, I'm having an awesome year or you probably forgot what happened
*  to me this year.
*  Davis for his career in the playoffs is averaging 25 and 10 in 50 plus playoff games, which
*  puts him in the company of these guys since the merger.
*  Jonas, Dirk, Jokic, Hakim, Anthony Davis.
*  That's it.
*  So he's been a really good playoff guy.
*  He's been averaging 26 and 12, 54% field goal was probably for the last few years.
*  But then you look like from 2013 to 24, he's 83rd in playoff games.
*  This century is 169th in playoff games played.
*  So he's had this career that's both been really good, but at the same time, I'm not
*  sure it shouldn't have been better.
*  And then you have Embiid who, you know, you go through his last seven playoff years, loses
*  to Boston in round two.
*  Had an orbital fracture in a concussion that year.
*  Loses to Toronto in game seven in 2019, the Kawhi shot.
*  Had knee tendonitis that year.
*  Sweat by Boston in 2020.
*  Nothing wrong with him other than Ben Simmons was an exit stage right.
*  2021 loses to Atlanta in seven.
*  They're up three one.
*  He has torn meniscus in that series.
*  2022 lost to Miami in six.
*  It was tied to two.
*  And then they lost the last two.
*  He had a torn thumb, ligament, orbital fracture and a concussion that series.
*  2023 was the worst one round two, up three two in the series.
*  They ended up losing to Boston in seven.
*  He had a sprained knee that year.
*  And then 2024 round one loses to the Knicks in six torn meniscus.
*  I bring this up because he gave this New York Times interview.
*  Where they talked about greatest player of all time stuff.
*  And the interviewer said, is the implication that you think you would be in the greatest
*  poor of all time conversation about the injury problems?
*  And beat said, I think so.
*  I think I'm that talented.
*  I obviously need to win championships and the win championships.
*  You need other guys.
*  You can't do it by yourself.
*  I want to win so bad, but if you don't, you just got to understand that as long
*  as you care about the right stuff, if it doesn't happen, maybe it wasn't.
*  Meant to be, which brings me to my third piece of the six pack with Embiid.
*  It's all about the injuries.
*  So he's self-aware enough.
*  To say like, yeah, this could have gone better.
*  I had some bad luck.
*  It's too bad.
*  At the same time, Joel Embiid, there's bad luck.
*  And then there's the question, is your body totally meant to play basketball,
*  which is a question we wonder about a lot, especially with big guys.
*  We wondered about it with Yao Ming.
*  We wondered about it with Bill Walton.
*  Like Embiid is talking about himself as like without the injuries, I'd be in
*  the greatest poor of all time conversation.
*  Bill Walton actually did have the injuries and would have been in the greatest
*  poor of all time conversation.
*  And we saw when he was healthy, he actually ran through the league and won
*  the title and probably would have had a dynasty.
*  When you're talking about greatest poor of all time, first of all, that's
*  ludicrous because if you're not durable, you, you can't be in the conversation.
*  And he's never been durable even before he had all these injuries
*  the last seven years ago.
*  So the better question is, could he have been in the greatest center of all time
*  conversation, which again, now you're competing against Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,
*  who wasn't just one of the three best players of all time, who didn't just have
*  one of the great start to finish high school to college to MBA careers we've ever
*  seen, who won all kinds of MVPs who won, I think six titles by the time it was
*  said and done, but was also astoundingly durable.
*  And over and over again, if you look at the greatest of all time,
*  durability is a big piece of it.
*  It's a big piece of the LeBron case right now.
*  LeBron might not be able to beat the ceiling of Michael Jordan.
*  He might not have as many MVPs and rings as Kareem, but his case would be the
*  career case.
*  It would be just for 20 plus years, the durability that he had, the reliability,
*  just, he was just always there over and over again and really was a little bit
*  indestructible and Embiid was the opposite.
*  So Embiid said in this interview, you think about it, the thing that stopped me
*  all these years is just freak injuries.
*  Every single playoffs, regular season, people falling on my knee or breaking my
*  face twice.
*  It's always freak injuries at the wrong time.
*  That's a piece of it.
*  Um, it doesn't explain what happened in 14 and 15 and why he only played 31 games
*  in the first three seasons of his career.
*  And I do have sympathy for him because it sucks when an athlete doesn't reach his
*  potential, but all you have to do is watch him.
*  All you have to do is look at pictures of him.
*  Um, when he was at Kansas for that one year before I entered the lottery, what he
*  looked like when he was even working out for teams versus what he looks like, what
*  he looked like last season, what he looks like at the Olympics now, where he's
*  just not in the same shape.
*  I could have been one of the best players ever.
*  I had some bad luck and I also feel like there's some things I would do over
*  again.
*  I would be in better shape.
*  Um, I would, I would try to, uh, I would try to condition my body better so I
*  could absorb some of this stuff.
*  And it just doesn't seem like he gets it.
*  Even he had some quote later about continuity.
*  On the one hand, I love that we have candid athletes.
*  On the other hand, um, his career made more sense after I read the interview.
*  Then he says later, and this became a big story this week where he says, he's
*  talking about team USA and he says, you got to understand most of those guys are
*  older.
*  The LeBron now is not the LeBron.
*  That was a couple of years of years ago.
*  So it's a big difference.
*  Everyone would also tell you, and you can see for yourself, the athletic LeBron
*  dominant that he was a couple of years ago is not the same that he is now.
*  I think people get fooled by the names on paper, but those names have been built
*  throughout their career.
*  And now they're older than not what they used to be.
*  That's a crazy thing to say about somebody you're about to play in the Olympics with.
*  And conversely, if they were reporters went to LeBron and said, Hey, what'd you
*  think about what Embiid said to you about how you're not the same guy?
*  And LeBron said, you know, he's probably right to some degree.
*  I'm 40 years old.
*  I've been in the NBA forever, but you know, I feel like I can get 95% there.
*  But if I was Joe, I would be worried about China's stage.
*  I wouldn't be worrying about other players.
*  I'd be worried about me.
*  We wish Joe well was in shape.
*  He's only playing 14 to 16 minutes a game for us in team USA.
*  I wish he was in better shape.
*  I'm sure if you talk to anybody in the Sixers and gave them true serum, like
*  in truth, in true lies, I'm sure all of them would say we wish Embiid was in better
*  shape.
*  The results are the results.
*  You can talk about bad luck all you want, but he's never played in round three in
*  the playoffs.
*  And at some point you would think like, is this guy going to approach basketball
*  from I'm getting better as an offensive player, which I think he has.
*  I think he's the most talented offensive center we've had since Kareem, but there's
*  that other, are you in the best possible shape?
*  Are you absolutely ripped?
*  Um, did you, did you, did we read some article about all the stuff you did and
*  you're the Versa climber and you're swimming?
*  Like we just never seen that.
*  And I don't think we're going to, we didn't see it with Shaq.
*  Some guys just don't have it.
*  So I guess, I guess I'm pushing back on the, could have been the greatest player
*  ever thing because we've just never seen the off the court work discipline from
*  him that all the other great guys had that Jordan had that Kareem had that
*  LeBron had that bill, even bill Russell in the sixties, fifties and sixties when,
*  you know, nobody had any of this stuff and he was still out there all the time.
*  The only time he got hurt was in 1958 finals.
*  So, uh, just wish Joel Embiid was in better shape.
*  The fourth thing on the six pack, the 12th Olympic spot and the concept of this,
*  which is going to dive into Jaylen Brown in one second, but when you're picking a
*  team, as we talked about earlier at the minutes, you know, you're going to have
*  that one game where only nine guys, maybe 10 are going to play.
*  So they're picking this team.
*  They know they're building around AD and Bam and KD and Tatum and LeBron and
*  Curry and Edwards and Drew's the glue.
*  And they're building around that.
*  And they're building around that.
*  And they're building around that.
*  And Curry and Edwards and Drew is the glue guys.
*  So they know they have eight guys.
*  Then Embiid decides he's going to play.
*  Derek White is in that kind of shut down defender backup guard defense spot that
*  you have to have, because all these guard, all these teams have, uh, these
*  fast guards teams can go small.
*  You just need guards in your defense.
*  So white gets that spot over Jaylen Suggs, Alex Crusoe, whoever you want to
*  talk about there, and then that last spot, Jaylen Brown, you're basically
*  talking about him versus Devin Booker versus Donovan Mitchell, in my opinion.
*  And Mitchell was never really in the mix for this.
*  So it was always Booker and Booker was on the 21 team, played a lot of minutes.
*  Uh, they picked Booker.
*  Booker was in there early and Booker is a very good international player.
*  But once, once you do that, now you have KD, you have Tatum, you have LeBron,
*  you have Curry, you have Edwards, you have Drew and you have Booker.
*  You don't really have minutes for Jaylen Brown, who just won the finals MVP,
*  who was just on a title team.
*  And now you're going to add him to this team last minute because Kawhi gets
*  shut down and he's not going to play.
*  And that's going to go good from a chemistry standpoint.
*  It's not.
*  The white pick was a chemistry pick.
*  That's it.
*  White's not going to care if he doesn't play or not.
*  Jaylen Brown now playing is a little bit of a different, it's a little bit,
*  it's embarrassing.
*  He probably thinks he's on the same level as KD and Tatum and LeBron at this point.
*  And he might not be wrong.
*  So now you're telling him, no, sit on the side.
*  We're going to watch this happen with Edwards and Booker during the Olympics.
*  Cause one of those guys is going to be the odd man out as this goes along,
*  because they're going to need Derek White's glue guy, his ability to play a
*  little point guard, his ability to do a small ball guard lineup and Booker or
*  Edwards is probably going to lose minutes to him would be my prediction.
*  And then KD, when he comes back, same thing.
*  Um, so if you're building a no ego team and just not, not worrying about anything
*  other than just putting the best players on, there's a Jaylen versus Booker
*  argument, you'd probably take chat over and be so you don't have to worry about,
*  well, what if Embiid gets mad?
*  He only played nine minutes in the gold medal game.
*  You just take that off the table and then how burn and wait, but that's,
*  that's not what they did.
*  So the thing with Jaylen.
*  On paper.
*  Yeah.
*  If Kawhi bows out, will you replace them with a more durable, better
*  version of a small forward who can guard different positions?
*  That makes sense.
*  But to me, it made sense not to have them because it brings up all the
*  chemistry stuff that you want to avoid, which brings me to the fifth thing
*  I want to talk about.
*  Everyone knew Derek White was going to get the Kawhi spot for a couple months.
*  I knew in May, um, if Kawhi somehow wasn't ready to go, by the way,
*  tough blow for the Coopers, it wasn't going to be Jaylen.
*  It was going to be Derek White.
*  And I think Jaylen knew this too, but yet he, he said something anyway.
*  And it was what the Celtics have had a couple of moments during this summer.
*  Right.
*  Everything goes right in the playoffs to win the title.
*  What happens right after all of a sudden the owner is selling the team.
*  WIC with Grossbeck.
*  That makes me nervous.
*  Now we have a little instability at the top.
*  The poor Zingis injury, which he played on in game five, and then it comes out.
*  He's out for six months.
*  Oof.
*  Well, he's not back until December.
*  Well, to me, that means February.
*  I'm just assuming we're not seeing poor Zingis until February.
*  That would be the safe bet to me.
*  So you have that.
*  So now the Celtics, it's already hard enough to repeat.
*  Now you have two major things going against you.
*  And then you have this Jaylen thing.
*  It's a little bit of a different thing.
*  And then you have this Jaylen thing, which, you know, I don't, I don't want
*  to throw a tantrum about it, but I didn't love it.
*  A lot of people are asking me over the last couple of weeks, what'd you think
*  of Jaylen saying what he said about how he, you know, basically insinuating he
*  should have made it over white, who's his teammate.
*  And my answer was I didn't like it because it wasn't the kind of thing that
*  would have happened before they won the title before they won the title.
*  There was a selflessness to that team.
*  That was one of the things that made it special.
*  And even though Jaylen's right and he should be one of the 12 guys in this
*  team, if we were just picking a team of the 12 best guys, he should be on the
*  team if we're doing that, but that's not what the team was the team.
*  They're trying to do all of these different things with the team and
*  white made, and white made more sense for it.
*  So if he's going to express this pleasure, if he's going to blame Nike or whatever,
*  you have to do it through the prism of Derek White's an awesome player.
*  And he made, he was a great choice.
*  It's upsetting to me that I wasn't given a chance to compete for one
*  of the forward spots, some way to frame it.
*  That doesn't make it seem like you're kind of shitting on your teammate
*  because he got picked over you.
*  That's not the kind of stuff that was happening before they won the title.
*  So as you know, uh, I loved the secret, which Isaiah Thomas revealed in 1989.
*  I, I based it as a big premise around my basketball book.
*  When we did the book of basketball stuff, I brought it back.
*  And this was something he talked about during the 89 finals when
*  he was in a press conference.
*  And Isaiah said, I looked at Seattle who won one year in Houston, who got to
*  the finals one year, they both self-destructed the next year.
*  How come I read Pat Riley's book show time.
*  He talks about the disease of more a team wins at one year and the next year,
*  every player wants more minutes, more minutes, more money, more shots, and it
*  kills them.
*  Our team has been up at the championship level four years now.
*  We could have easily self-destructed.
*  So I read what Riley was saying and I learned I didn't want what happened to
*  Seattle and he's snapping us, but it's hard not to be selfish.
*  The art of winning is complicated by statistics, which for us becomes money.
*  We've got to fight that final way around it.
*  And I think we have, right?
*  So you've heard me read that.
*  And then the other thing he said was lots of times on our team, you can't tell who
*  the best player in the game was because everybody did something good.
*  That's what makes us so good.
*  The other team has to worry about stopping eight or nine people instead of
*  two or three.
*  It's the only way to win.
*  The only way to win.
*  It's the way the game was invented.
*  There's more to that.
*  You've got to create an environment that won't accept losing.
*  I would argue that described what the Celtics were last year.
*  There was selflessness to them.
*  They didn't care who scored.
*  They just wanted to win.
*  They didn't care who got the attention.
*  They just wanted to win.
*  They wanted to show up, play for each other.
*  And it was one of my favorite Celtics teams ever.
*  And then a month and a half later we have stuff like this and it just makes me
*  nervous because I think it's really hard to repeat.
*  Once you win, you got what you wanted.
*  Now people start veering toward what's best for them.
*  And that's what the Jalen thing felt to me.
*  I hope I'm wrong and I hope this team's able to snap out of it.
*  But if you're talking about disease and more champs, 67 Sixers, 71 bucks, 75
*  warriors, 77 Blazers, 79 Sonics, 80 Lakers, 92 Bulls.
*  They ended up winning.
*  Oh, Lakers.
*  They ended up winning.
*  Oh, four pistons.
*  Oh, six heat 2010 Lakers, 16 calves, 18 warriors.
*  And really the 22 warriors I have to count because the Jordan pool Dremont
*  thing happened right after, which was another one of those moments where you're
*  like, ah, that's a bad sign.
*  I'm just pointing this out.
*  I'm not panicking yet about the Celtics.
*  I think they're fine.
*  They have everybody coming back.
*  Hopefully poor Zangos will come back before the All-Star break.
*  But I do wonder if like next June, if they don't win and we're looking back
*  and we're like, man, remember June and July when like that happened and that
*  happened, that happened and it does feel a little piece of that.
*  I wish Jalen didn't say that.
*  And I love Jalen Brown and he's one of my favorite Celtics of the last 20 years.
*  And I just think it was a bad moment.
*  I don't think he should have done it.
*  Last thing on the six pack.
*  I'm going to make this my superior take and it plays off what we just
*  talked about with Boston, just some little red flags.
*  The Milwaukee Bucks are 15 to one on Fandl and Giannis is six to one on it for MVP.
*  And they had the year from hell last year, right?
*  Name it.
*  It went wrong.
*  Nobody has beaten a healthy Giannis since the 2022 Celtics beat them in seven.
*  Thanks to an insane game six performance by Jason Tatum.
*  And if you go look at that box score, there's no Chris Middleton in that series.
*  Giannis had 46 and 20 in that game.
*  It's not like he wasn't doing anything and Tatum ends up just leaving his body
*  wins, go to game seven, Grant Williams.
*  It's a bunch of threes.
*  All of a sudden the bucks are out and the next two years, a bunch of dumb shit
*  happens and Giannis isn't healthy in either playoffs and now he's 30 years old.
*  Dame's 33 Middleton's 33.
*  And yet I kind of like where the bucks are because they're under the radar.
*  Now nobody's talking about them, right?
*  Even think about the Olympics.
*  The bucks are irrelevant in the Olympics basketball discussion.
*  The two teams that in the summer got the most attention for moves in the East
*  were Philly and, uh, and the New York Knicks you have Orlando got better.
*  And Milwaukee is just kind of like, yeah, yeah, they won in 21, but now they're old.
*  And so you have Dame coming back from a year from hell.
*  No question.
*  Um, this is probably the biggest season of his career.
*  Cause if it doesn't happen this year, I don't know if it happens for him as the
*  top two guy, they got a couple of breaks, poor Zingas being out for half the year
*  and beads out of shape.
*  The Knicks never got a center.
*  The Knicks, by the way, I grew with that.
*  They could probably get a center in January or February.
*  Um, the big thing that I think slipped under the radar.
*  They signed a bunch of guys who can play in a game seven for minimum
*  contracts over the summer.
*  They signed Delon, right?
*  I've always liked to can absolutely play in a big game.
*  Gary Trent, who was just sitting there for somebody's steel, um, a three and D
*  guy who hasn't really played with a point guard for the last couple of years.
*  Right.
*  And it's just been on these weird Toronto teams that keep changing their identities.
*  But I don't, that guy's unafraid.
*  I don't mind Gary Trent.
*  And then Prince on the Lakers who I didn't think had a great year, but guys
*  have a tendency to not have awesome years sometimes in that LeBron AD infrastructure.
*  As a night guy, he's going to be better than Jay Crowder and whoever they're
*  going to have Conant and coming back.
*  They still have Portis and, uh, and I kind of like their nine.
*  And the big thing for me, Yannis, who in the last six years for MVP finished
*  first, first, fourth, third, third, and fourth for the last six years, he's 30,
*  12 and six, just every season.
*  And from a perception standpoint, Yokej passed on Luca, passed on
*  Wemby's coming, the Celtics have the best team and he's just kind of over here.
*  And he hasn't really played since March.
*  And I just am expecting some insane Yannis.
*  I'm taking back my turf territory.
*  So, you know, people think sometimes when I talk about the Celtics, people think
*  I'm doing like reverse jinxes, like people in my life, they're like, Oh, you're
*  just saying this because you're trying to jinx whoever I'm the most worried
*  about the Bucs in the East.
*  That's where I've landed.
*  That's where I've had a little bit of a vacation the last few weeks.
*  The Bucs are the scariest team to me.
*  I'm not that worried about Philly.
*  I think that's going to be Dave.
*  Two of their top three are injury potential guys.
*  They're throwing a whole bunch of dudes together.
*  I still have some questions about Paul George and Philly, how that's going to
*  play out over an eight month span.
*  The Knicks, there's going to be some weird minute stuff with them with bringing
*  Randall back with who's going to finish games.
*  They don't have enough size.
*  I think they're really going to miss Hartenstein.
*  Are they going to get the same healthy season for Brunson?
*  And then you have Milwaukee, which is going to be stable.
*  You would dock out in the coaching staff like, like Missoula did over last summer.
*  And 15 to one on Fandl, normally you don't get good odds on teams, but that to
*  me, that should be 10 to one.
*  And that was one that jumped out to me.
*  And then the Celtics over under for wins on Fandl was 58 and a half, which just
*  seems too high to me if they're not going to have poor Zangas for at least half the
*  season, that feels like to me that should be, um, maybe in the 54 range.
*  Anyway, watch out for the Bucs.
*  That's a, I said last year, don't watch out for the Bucs.
*  I'm not buying it this year.
*  I'm, I'm, I'm a little more intrigued.
*  Anyway, that was today's six major things.
