# Could the Knicks Get Giannis Someday? | The Bill Simmons Podcast | The Ringer
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [July 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY)
*  All right, the Knicks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm just going to throw this out there. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=1.8s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=4.0s)]
*  I was talking on my pod a couple of days ago about how we're on the clock with Yanis. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=5.0s)]
*  I think Yanis has one year left with this Milwaukee team to see how it goes. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=13.36s)]
*  And if they start to look old, if Chris Middleton looks the same way he's looked for the last [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=20.64s)]
*  two years where he's not, he can't stay on the court. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  He can't look like Chris Middleton from the 2021 playoffs for long stretches. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=27.68s)]
*  Brook Lopez is going to be in year, I think 16. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=33.2s)]
*  I don't really trust any of their swing guys. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=36.76s)]
*  And if he feels like I can't win a title here anymore, I think he cares the most about titles [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=39.76s)]
*  and rings. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  I don't even think he really cares about markets. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  And I also think he'd be the kind of guy who would say with a year left, hey, I'm going [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=50.2s)]
*  to leave in a year as a free agent because he can opt out summer 2025. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=54.56s)]
*  I'm going to leave in a year or you can trade me now. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=60.080000000000005s)]
*  We've seen players do this in the past where they have the respect for the team and they [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  want to put their team in a position to make a move and put themselves in a position to [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=71.12s)]
*  win a title faster. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=75.44s)]
*  Now we talk about the Knicks. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=78.04s)]
*  You've been in this position before with the Knicks where there's been this big prize looming. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=81.32s)]
*  It's like those amusement park rides. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=85.66s)]
*  That's why I'm sitting there going like this, yo Bill, we supposed to be cool man. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=86.66s)]
*  Why are you bringing this up? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=87.66s)]
*  Why are you doing this to me man? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=88.66s)]
*  It's the amusement park ride where that thing's hanging with the claws and you're trying to [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=89.66s)]
*  hit it with the claws. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=92.66s)]
*  You know how I get about the Knicks man. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=93.66s)]
*  Don't do that to me man. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=94.66s)]
*  I mean listen. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=95.66s)]
*  But I'm telling you, I think this is where the season's going to head. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=96.66s)]
*  Where all of a sudden the Yannis Prize is going to start hanging over this Knicks season. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=103.74s)]
*  This is what I want to understand. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=109.48s)]
*  You and I have talked basketball on several occasions in the past. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=111.62s)]
*  I want you to learn something about me today. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=113.94s)]
*  Because first of all, I'm a really miserable Knicks man. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  I do not like how Leon Rose hides from the public and has no accountability whatsoever. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  You make it a deal with Danny Ainge and you got Gertrude Rojas on the phone speaking for [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=136.24s)]
*  you instead of yourself when you're the president of basketball operations, which I thought [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=141.78s)]
*  was a disgrace. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=145.4s)]
*  I respect Leon Rose, but I hadn't respected how he's handled himself in terms of being [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  accountable to Knicks fans. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=153.68s)]
*  Even though he's obviously done a decent job because they've been in the playoffs two of [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=156.0s)]
*  the four years he's been here. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=159.08s)]
*  Having said that, let me say this. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=161.48000000000002s)]
*  The New York Knicks, and this is what you need to know about me, one of the biggest [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=164.24s)]
*  reasons I'm miserable is because we're the media capital in the world with the number [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=168.16s)]
*  one market and we can't get a star. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=171.28s)]
*  Think about this. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=173.96s)]
*  Our last real bona fide star. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  One with St. Patrick. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=181.96s)]
*  You and I'm going to go back to Walt Clyde. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=182.96s)]
*  I would say Bernard. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=186.12s)]
*  You're not going to say Bernard for a year and a half. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=187.12s)]
*  Well, Bernard, because that's potentially injured. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=189.16000000000003s)]
*  You know I know how big time Bernard was. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  I know, but for 18 months I thought Bernard was fantastic. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=192.88s)]
*  You're right. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=195.4s)]
*  You're right. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=196.4s)]
*  OK, OK, fine. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=197.4s)]
*  What I mean by that is this. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=198.4s)]
*  I haven't had somebody arrive in New York that made me look and say, you know what, we might [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=201.32s)]
*  want to tie. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=207.24s)]
*  We might want to tie. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=208.24s)]
*  I haven't had that guy. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=209.24s)]
*  When Bernard was here, you had Magic and Bird and Isaiah and Jordan was coming and Barclay [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=211.76s)]
*  was coming and you know, you had all of that going on. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=218.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=221.76s)]
*  When Ewing was there, that's what was going on. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=222.76s)]
*  When Carmelo was there, LeBron was in Miami, man. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=226.23999999999998s)]
*  You know, D-Wave was in Miami. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=230.2s)]
*  I'm looking for the guy. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=232.51999999999998s)]
*  You always had the third guy in the movie. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=235.04s)]
*  You always had the third guy in the movie. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=237.48s)]
*  You never had the lead guy in the poster. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=239.04s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I'm looking for the guy that arrives in a New York Knicks uniform that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=241.0s)]
*  has the city saying, we might win. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=246.84s)]
*  Because of this guy, we don't have that guy, which is why I so desperately wanted KD and [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=251.16s)]
*  Kyrie to come to New York to the Knicks and they were coming at the 11th hour until Kyrie [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=256.88s)]
*  convinced KD to change his mind. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=262.24s)]
*  That was DeAndre Jordan's fault. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=263.88s)]
*  You know that story. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=266.44s)]
*  DeAndre Jordan played on that Knicks team. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=267.44s)]
*  He's like, you guys can't go here. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  This place is a mess. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=270.48s)]
*  Oh, my Lord. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=271.76s)]
*  That's one of the things that was said. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=272.56s)]
*  Also, it was Kyrie thinking about creating his own legacy and all of that stuff. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=274.92s)]
*  The bottom line is, could you imagine if Kevin Durant was in New York? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=279.72s)]
*  And I'm talking about when Kevin Durant had that 49-point game that I predicted he dropped [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=284.12s)]
*  50 after Kyrie got hurt and he went against Milwaukee and gave five and he dropped 49 [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=289.24s)]
*  but missed 50 because he missed a free throw. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  And I predicted that morning on first day he was going to drop 50 or the KD that showed [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=296.32000000000005s)]
*  up in game seven and stuff like that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  And it just couldn't happen. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=301.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, when's the last time the Garden had that? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=303.52000000000004s)]
*  And that's what I'm looking for, man. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=308.16s)]
*  This is New York and the stars are everywhere but New York. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=310.56s)]
*  And that's what bothered me. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=315.68s)]
*  Jalen Brunson is a sensational player. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=316.8s)]
*  He did a sensational job for us this year. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=318.36s)]
*  We all know that, you know, he's not box office himself. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=320.28000000000003s)]
*  He can really ball, but he's not the marquee. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=324.52s)]
*  I want a marquee, man. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=329.0s)]
*  I want a marquee bag with legitimate championship aspirations, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=330.96s)]
*  that's what I'm talking about. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=336.4s)]
*  So you're in this situation that I think is going to happen with Giannis, especially, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=338.64s)]
*  let's say they start out 12-8 or whatever and everybody's going to start talking about it. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=342.84s)]
*  You've been in this situation, LeBron 2010, KD that whole summer before 2016. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=348.0s)]
*  Who else? Who else has been dangled like the... [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=356.59999999999997s)]
*  No, it was really them. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=361.03999999999996s)]
*  Those are the two biggest examples, no doubt. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=365.52000000000004s)]
*  Because 2010 was devastating because that was like basically two years of hoping, praying, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=368.96000000000004s)]
*  this free agent class and then with Amaris Stoudemire. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=374.88s)]
*  And that's how it was for me. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=378.56s)]
*  I was fired by ESPN. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=379.64000000000004s)]
*  I was gone. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=381.24s)]
*  By this time, I started back in the business, starting for Fox Sports Radio. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=382.08000000000004s)]
*  And I broke the story that they were going to South Beach. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=386.32s)]
*  They were joining forces in South Beach. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=389.36s)]
*  I remember and I made fun of it and I was like, there's no fucking way. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=390.16s)]
*  That's not happening. And then it happened. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=393.8s)]
*  And it happened. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=395.56s)]
*  And so I'm sitting there and like, but in the same breath, I'm sad because even though I'm breaking the story, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=396.92s)]
*  that means he ain't coming to New York. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=402.72s)]
*  Yet another guy ain't coming to New York. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=405.48s)]
*  We have one draft pick away, one pick from getting Steph Curry. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=407.72s)]
*  And he lands at number seven and go to the state. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=413.40000000000003s)]
*  The Knicks had the eighth pick. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=416.48s)]
*  OK, the Zion dig. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=418.2s)]
*  It's either Zion or Ja Morant. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=420.84000000000003s)]
*  We get the number three pick. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=424.52000000000004s)]
*  We get our J.P. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=425.68s)]
*  I mean, it's like, hey, you might be the best pick out of those three. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=426.68s)]
*  Who knows? You better get the best guy. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=430.44s)]
*  It's very depressing. It's very depressing. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=432.68s)]
*  It just drives me nuts, man. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=434.8s)]
*  But, you know, I mean, it's hard for me to remain objective about my Knicks because I love the franchise so much. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=436.2s)]
*  I'm a diehard lifelong Knicks fan, but they make me sick because I have yet to receive any joy from them at all. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=442.16s)]
*  Well, at least they have assets now to make a move, which has been not been the case for a long time. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=449.68s)]
*  Yeah. But how do you think I feel when you had those assets and you could utilize them to get Donald and Mitchell and you didn't get them? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=456.56s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=464.08s)]
*  I think you're fine. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=465.32s)]
*  Danny Angel's asking for too much. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=466.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, maybe if you hadn't gone to the playoff series between Utah and Dallas and recruited acting like you still at Kentucky or something, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=467.56s)]
*  maybe that you wouldn't have irritated Danny Angel because he's done a deal with you. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=475.44s)]
*  Dick Donovan met you before. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=479.48s)]
*  This is the kind of stuff that I'm talking about, though. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=481.44s)]
*  And you have the Embiid possibilities, too. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=483.68s)]
*  If they make no trades, Harden comes back, he's miserable, Embiid's miserable. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=485.71999999999997s)]
*  That's always sitting there, too. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=491.2s)]
*  I don't know about that. I don't know. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=492.88s)]
*  But I don't think Embiid will leave Philadelphia. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=494.32s)]
*  I think they'll do everything they can to keep him. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=496.64s)]
*  They'll clean house. They'll do what they have to do. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=498.44s)]
*  Darrell Moore, you had better do something. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=499.96s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=501.84s)]
*  You better figure it out. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=503.04s)]
*  We know is the biggest Knicks win of the last 10 years. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=504.28000000000003s)]
*  So the idiotic Brooklyn is going to replace the Knicks and watch Brooklyn. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=507.68s)]
*  They're going to build this whole basketball thing. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=512.36s)]
*  And I listen, I've never lived in New York in my life. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=514.28s)]
*  I was like, that's never happening. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=518.08s)]
*  The Knicks have like six generations of fans. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=519.4s)]
*  Exactly. Brooklyn's just going to waltz in and become the new basketball capital. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=521.76s)]
*  What the fuck are you guys talking about? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=525.72s)]
*  So at least that's been vindicated. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=527.28s)]
*  Tyree Urban and Kevin Durant easily cost themselves about a half a billion dollars [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=529.04s)]
*  by choosing Brooklyn over the New York Knicks. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=534.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm talking about off court opportunities, off court opportunities. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=536.88s)]
*  Easily cost themselves a half a billion dollars. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=542.8s)]
*  Easy. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCy2wu0TvY&t=546.52s)]
