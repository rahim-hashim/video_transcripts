# San Antonio Steals De'Aaron Fox — Wemby’s Perfect Running Mate? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [February 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4)
*  Fox to the Spurs, Levine to Sacramento with some picks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=0.0s)]
*  Chicago basically gets their 2025 pick back and takes some, some contracts. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=4.04s)]
*  And the headline Kirk is that San Antonio did not give up a lot for De'Aaron Fox. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  So why? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=16.12s)]
*  They're in a different regime. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=18.64s)]
*  They think they're in, they're officially now bill in, in try to win mode, which is [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=19.88s)]
*  sort of a big paradigm shift for the San Antonio Spurs that have been in rebuild [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=24.28s)]
*  mode. But now they're trying to try to win mode. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=28.28s)]
*  I think this is the symbolic threshold of a team that's ready to compete. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=30.6s)]
*  OK, so why didn't they give up more picks to get De'Aaron Fox, who I had number 20 [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=36.400000000000006s)]
*  on my trade value list? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=40.24s)]
*  Because I didn't have to. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=41.52s)]
*  It was the short answer. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  They gave up some draft capital, obviously. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=43.44s)]
*  I think those are some nice picks they gave up. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=45.28s)]
*  But I expected maybe to see Devin Vassell's name, maybe see Jeremy Sohan's name. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=48.72s)]
*  I think, yeah, you're right. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=53.64s)]
*  The headline is that none of those guys as we have right now are included in this [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=54.76s)]
*  deal. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  So they kept Wemby, Fox, they added Vassell, Castle, who I think was a non-starter. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  Sohan, Harrison Barnes, Kelton Johnson, CP3, Champagne. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=66.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=73.12s)]
*  Pretty nice nine. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=73.96s)]
*  Now CP3 coming off the bench, maybe playing with Fox. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  We've seen CP3 in OKC. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=77.92s)]
*  He was playing with Schroeder and with SGA. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=80.56s)]
*  He weirdly knows how to play with other small guards. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=83.44s)]
*  If I'm a Spurs fan, I'm out of my mind that this was the trade because they gave up the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=87.04s)]
*  27 Spurs first. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=93.48s)]
*  I have Wemby. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  I'm going to be one of the best 10 teams in the league in 27. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=94.92s)]
*  They gave up the 20-31 Minnesota first, which hurts. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=97.88s)]
*  That might be a real pick. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=101.28s)]
*  They got this. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  They gave up this 20-25 Charlotte pick that is basically one through 14 protected and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  is going to turn into two seconds. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=109.80000000000001s)]
*  And Sacramento gets two first five seconds and they get Zach Levine, who I think we both [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=111.39999999999999s)]
*  really like this year. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=117.83999999999999s)]
*  I actually think he's an asset. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=118.91999999999999s)]
*  I love it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=121.55999999999999s)]
*  But again, they don't have a North Star. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=121.96s)]
*  The Sacramento Kings have been like this my whole life. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=123.6s)]
*  I don't know what they're trying to do now. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=125.91999999999999s)]
*  They reunited the great DeRozan Levine duo. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=127.11999999999999s)]
*  They reunited in eight seed for multiple years from the East Coast. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=130.88s)]
*  Eight seed is back for vengeance. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=134.64s)]
*  This time. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=137.32s)]
*  Vuchash is feeling left out. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=138.12s)]
*  Come on guys. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  We could have gone 43 and 39 together. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=141.72s)]
*  Why am I still in Chicago? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=143.88000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=145.48000000000002s)]
*  For me, the story here is in San Antonio, Bill. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=145.68s)]
*  The Spurs have a sort of a stopgap point guard and Chris Paul, who's been great. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=147.88000000000002s)]
*  Harrison Barnes has been great, but this is a player in Fox that is a young, great [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=152.76000000000002s)]
*  offensive weapon that I think will pair very well with Victor Wemba Nyama. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=159.72000000000003s)]
*  This is a team that I think was going to have a very high defensive ceiling just [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=166.24s)]
*  because of Victor for years to come. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=170.52s)]
*  But the offense was the question mark. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=172.36s)]
*  This helps them address that. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=174.12s)]
*  And now I think it's like we have Victor at the five, we have Fox at the one. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=176.20000000000002s)]
*  Let's surround two, three, and four with defense and shooting. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=181.36s)]
*  And I think there's a clear team building project in front of them [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=185.44s)]
*  that they are thrilled to have. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=189.32s)]
*  It's a pretty simple problem now as opposed to a bigger problem. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  And they still have a bunch of picks. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=195.12s)]
*  They have the two, three, four spots, a lot of length, some potential shooting, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=197.0s)]
*  although they haven't been shooting the ball this year, but ultimately you're [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=201.0s)]
*  hoping there's going to be some shooting and, uh, and they protected their nucleus [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=203.4s)]
*  and they still have another trade to make. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  I still feel like the only, the only like no way they're trading these guys on [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  the Spurs will be Wemby, now Fox and Castle. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  And everyone else is still in play for me and they have contracts they can put [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=218.44s)]
*  together. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=221.88s)]
*  They're not going to trade for Jimmy Butler, but if, you know, he was a [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=222.56s)]
*  little more enticing, that's the type of trade. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=225.44s)]
*  Uh, maybe they could trade for Luka. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=227.96s)]
*  Donchich if he fails his physical in the Lakers and it turns out he's 290 pounds. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=230.04000000000002s)]
*  But, uh, but this is an awesome trade for them in my head. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=235.36s)]
*  I, this was a four or five firsts and probably so Han or. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  The sell in it seemed like that was it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=244.6s)]
*  But I guess if you're the Spurs, you're like, look, man, we're not giving up a [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=247.4s)]
*  lot for this dude. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=250.68s)]
*  He wants to come here anyway. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=252.08s)]
*  It's from Texas. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=253.4s)]
*  We'll just get them in a year and a half. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=254.84s)]
*  So we can do this now and you'll get some stuff or we'll just wait. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=256.48s)]
*  We're on no rush. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=260.76s)]
*  We're not going to win the title. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=261.52s)]
*  Um, one thing Eddie Johnson said in my pod on Thursday, I thought was a great [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=263.04s)]
*  basketball, ex basketball point was about Fox as a lefty with Wemby as a righty [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=266.12s)]
*  versus Fox, Fox as a lefty with Subonis as a lefty, which I thought was cool. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=270.8s)]
*  But I liked the idea of Fox, you know, not great when players push their way out [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=275.12s)]
*  of a team, but you know, he gave him a heads up. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=279.36s)]
*  I'm not going to resign here. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=282.44s)]
*  He's been pretty clear about that for the whole season. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=283.64s)]
*  He picked San Antonio. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=286.48s)]
*  He picks this whole Wemby circus that will become a circus in a good way, because [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=288.16s)]
*  you're attaching yourself to one of the, you know, generational superstars in the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=292.08000000000004s)]
*  league, you fit in nicely with him. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=295.68s)]
*  Now you throw those lobs. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=298.68s)]
*  That's a righty as Eddie was pointing out. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=299.8s)]
*  And, uh, it just feels like an incredible career move for Fox. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=301.6s)]
*  It really does. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=305.76s)]
*  It's like, wow, I totally get what you're thinking here. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=306.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  I couldn't agree more. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=310.08000000000004s)]
*  I mean, obviously we had the big piece on Victor on the Ringer last week. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=311.40000000000003s)]
*  I went in all, I went all in on this guy and then he had a great game in [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=315.56s)]
*  Paris right after, so I felt good. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=320.76s)]
*  But everybody around the league is seeing the same thing that we are Bill, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=323.52000000000004s)]
*  De'Aaron Fox among them. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=326.8s)]
*  This is a superstar and the, in the Ringer 100, he's gone from number 67 to [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=328.88s)]
*  number six in less than two years. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=333.84000000000003s)]
*  You had him as the number one trade value asset in the league. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=336.64s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=340.79999999999995s)]
*  Of course. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=342.4s)]
*  I mean, he's 21. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=343.2s)]
*  He's a 25 point a game score and he's the best defender in the league. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=344.91999999999996s)]
*  And he's, this is the worst Victor will ever see as his famous quote about himself. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=348.47999999999996s)]
*  And he's not just the best defender in the league. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=353.11999999999995s)]
*  He's decidedly the best defender in the league already. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=355.03999999999996s)]
*  He absolutely disrupts and devastates games with his defense and really [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=358.55999999999995s)]
*  fucks teams up already. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=362.76s)]
*  There was a sequence in Paris at the end of the third quarter that I'd ask [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=364.72s)]
*  everybody to go watch the first pacer's game in Paris, where Victor blocked four [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=369.32s)]
*  shots in a row, one was a goaltend. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=374.2s)]
*  And then he made a three through a lob and caught a lob on the other end of the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=377.96000000000004s)]
*  court. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=382.40000000000003s)]
*  And that was just like, all right, that's, that's crazy. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=382.92s)]
*  That's what De'Aaron Fox is seeing. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=386.96000000000004s)]
*  That's what everybody else is seeing. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=389.2s)]
*  This dude is only getting better. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=391.72s)]
*  And I think the Spurs are really excited today to have another piece in place, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=394.24s)]
*  another all star level piece for the future to build an offense specifically [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=398.40000000000003s)]
*  built around a guy who, and I think this is your term, looks like a giraffe on [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=404.12s)]
*  ice a little bit sometimes on offense. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=408.72s)]
*  De'Aaron Fox is going to take care of some of that and they can grow together. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=412.32s)]
*  And is there a better, just a lob game than Fox and Wembe? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=415.44s)]
*  I love it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=420.12s)]
*  I don't know if Fox is on a, if this is going to be like a Chicago Bulls run for [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=420.64s)]
*  Wembe someday or a Lakers run or, you know, a Kobe Gasol run or a 2010s Warriors run. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=426.36s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=433.47999999999996s)]
*  Fox to me seems more like a Clay Thompson, Draymond Green level star. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=435.24s)]
*  He's not like a true number two. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=441.0s)]
*  He's not the Kobe to Shaq, something like that. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=442.84s)]
*  It still feels like there's room for them to get one more awesome wing. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=444.96s)]
*  One more awesome wing. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=448.76s)]
*  And then that's the threesome. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=450.12s)]
*  Wembe, awesome wing, Fox, and they have two years to figure it out. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=452.12s)]
*  They're not going to win the title this year. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=456.56s)]
*  They're not going to win the title next year, but they have the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=457.8s)]
*  pieces to figure this out. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=460.84s)]
*  And as we're seeing now, not just with Fox, Wembe is becoming a seductive [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=462.24s)]
*  spot in San Antonio for, if you're a player that wants to win, that wants [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=468.12s)]
*  to kind of be along for the ride for some titles and some playoff appearances [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=472.96s)]
*  in a place with no state tax, a really good organization. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=477.0s)]
*  It becomes pretty enticing. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=480.92s)]
*  So here's the small market model working. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=482.68s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=485.52s)]
*  And I wrote this in the Wembe piece, but there's like two guys under, you [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=486.44s)]
*  know, 26 in the, in the ringer top 100s, top 10 rankings. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=489.8s)]
*  Victor Wembe Nama is by far the youngest. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=494.32s)]
*  And the other one is Luka Doncic, who is about to be 26, right? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=496.76s)]
*  So, I mean, Wembe has, he's going to be Doncic's age in 2029, I wrote, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=502.03999999999996s)]
*  which is just crazy. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=508.64s)]
*  Just think about how much time he has to get better. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=509.8s)]
*  And, and look, yeah, he is there. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=514.12s)]
*  He's going to be this great player. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=517.76s)]
*  We, I don't want to sort of belabor the point, but this is a deal that the Spurs, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=519.24s)]
*  they don't, they don't make a lot of trades. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=524.48s)]
*  They don't do this kind of thing historically. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=526.08s)]
*  So this is a big deal for them and I'm sure they're, they're pretty happy with it. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=530.24s)]
*  They didn't, like I said, I think the other headline is they didn't give up Castle. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=534.84s)]
*  They didn't give up the cell that didn't give up Sohan. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=538.6800000000001s)]
*  And they still have Atlanta's pick this year, which is, is looking really good. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=541.96s)]
*  Well, by the way, how is that pick not in this trade? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=545.88s)]
*  Cause Jalen Johnson just goes out and that Atlanta pick is going to be [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=548.32s)]
*  somewhere probably between nine and 14 in a really loaded draft. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=552.72s)]
*  Maybe even better than that. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=557.32s)]
*  I would have wanted that one. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=558.16s)]
*  Atlanta is, is fratering right now. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=559.48s)]
*  Unsurprisingly without Jalen. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=561.88s)]
*  So yeah, I think they're in really good shape and you know, nobody, nobody's, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=564.12s)]
*  nobody's truly surprised by that, but this is the kind of move that, that, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=568.88s)]
*  that a pop organization hadn't typically made. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=572.4s)]
*  This is a team that builds through the draft through savvy free agency signings. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=575.76s)]
*  Doesn't usually go after a big trade piece like this. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=581.36s)]
*  So it's a big deal for the San Antonio Spurs. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=584.08s)]
*  I'm just relieved that it, and we got some of it with Chris Paul this year, but [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=587.4s)]
*  you know, I am a big, if you have a big guy, you have to have a good or very good [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=591.1999999999999s)]
*  point guard that can take care of them. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=596.0799999999999s)]
*  If I have a good eater in my house, I want to have a good chef to cook for the, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=599.24s)]
*  if I have a hall of fame eater in my house, not going to go to the crappiest [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=603.3199999999999s)]
*  grocery store, I want real meals for my guy. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=607.4399999999999s)]
*  Sacramento now has a team of Sabonis, Levine, DeRozan, Malik Monk, Keegan Murray, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=610.52s)]
*  basically as the, I guess the crunch time five, I guess that means some monk playing, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=620.68s)]
*  playing some point DeRozan having the ball. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=627.0799999999999s)]
*  This is just turning into a let's just play our best five guys together. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=629.28s)]
*  They don't really have another point guard. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=633.64s)]
*  Maybe they'll try to get one. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=636.1999999999999s)]
*  Maybe they could try to flip an ass into something, but it's just a weird team. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=637.5600000000001s)]
*  And you mentioned earlier, it's a directionless team. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=641.72s)]
*  It's a team when we worked at Grantland together 10 years ago, we got a [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=643.84s)]
*  lot of comedy out of, they took Stauskas. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=647.1600000000001s)]
*  What was that with the eighth pick? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=650.0s)]
*  And, and it was that video of Vivek going around the table like Stauskas, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=652.0400000000001s)]
*  Stauskas going around and we all got a kick out of that. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=656.44s)]
*  They've just been in train wreck forever. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=659.24s)]
*  Really since, it's been 20 years of this. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=662.48s)]
*  Then two years ago, they get the two seed light, the beams happening. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=665.72s)]
*  They got a little something with Sabonis and Fox together and it feels [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=670.96s)]
*  like they're on the right way. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=673.9200000000001s)]
*  And this, this year they, they fire their coach. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=674.9200000000001s)]
*  They bring in Doug Christie, they start winning a couple of games. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=678.44s)]
*  It's like, Whoa, okay. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=681.84s)]
*  Feeling good again. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=683.4000000000001s)]
*  And then Fox has that trade request and it craters everything again. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=684.36s)]
*  They lost by 180 points to OKC yesterday and became clear. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=688.6400000000001s)]
*  Something was going to happen. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=692.8800000000001s)]
*  I don't, what would you tell Kings fan? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=694.24s)]
*  It's, it feels like the same old thing to me, Bill. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=696.8s)]
*  The West has been brutal since we've been covering basketball together. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=699.1999999999999s)]
*  You're looking at teams like Memphis, Houston, Oklahoma city, San Antonio for [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=704.0s)]
*  the foreseeable future, not to mention the LA Lakers, Edwards. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=709.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=714.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=714.76s)]
*  Not it's just, okay, what are you trying to do to get past teams like that? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=715.12s)]
*  So it's not a slight against the Kings, but it is, do you really think this is [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=721.5600000000001s)]
*  going to beat the Grizzlies or the Rockets or the Thunder? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=727.44s)]
*  I don't see that with a team built around Demar DeRose and Zach Levine. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=730.88s)]
*  And it was a cool story when they were like, because we've already seen it. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=737.44s)]
*  That's right. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=741.84s)]
*  I think you're right. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=743.84s)]
*  We have seen it. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=745.52s)]
*  So bonus playing with those guys is a fun wrinkle. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=747.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, the right kind of sophisticated offensive coach could probably [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=750.64s)]
*  have fun with this team. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=754.72s)]
*  I'm not sure Doug Christie's our guy for that. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=755.76s)]
*  And if I'm a Sacramento fan, I'm just bummed. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=758.52s)]
*  I'm bummed that we didn't get the Atlanta pick. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=762.12s)]
*  I'm bummed that I didn't get at least three firsts. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=764.12s)]
*  I'm bummed. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=766.04s)]
*  I didn't at least get, I don't know, so hand back something. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=766.64s)]
*  Could we have turned Keegan Murray into Devin Vassell? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=773.8s)]
*  You know, makes the spurs. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=777.8s)]
*  We just didn't get any of it. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=778.96s)]
*  And then from the Chicago side, you know, this is the, this is the Rinsedorf middle. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=780.64s)]
*  That's what they call it. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=786.68s)]
*  Can we be between 36 and 44 wins every year? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=788.36s)]
*  Can we have the illusion of hope? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=791.92s)]
*  I think in their case, like that team's not a contender. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=793.88s)]
*  I wanted to see Bud Zelas play more. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=796.4399999999999s)]
*  I actually like him. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=798.04s)]
*  Yeah, you like him. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=798.92s)]
*  They had to carve out some, uh, some minutes for him. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=799.72s)]
*  They got their first round pick back. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=802.68s)]
*  I would assume the next move is Vucevic being traded somewhere. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=804.92s)]
*  Um, maybe they moved Josh Giddy. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=809.64s)]
*  I don't know, but it would seem like this is a move toward let's now finish in the [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=812.56s)]
*  bottom 10 in the league and try to get another good pick. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=816.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=818.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=819.56s)]
*  And I think they reclaimed their own pick, which is great. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=820.0799999999999s)]
*  Um, so they can be there, but yeah, Vucevic has some value on the market. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=822.9599999999999s)]
*  I know teams like Phoenix or Golden State have been looking for shooting bigs. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=828.0s)]
*  Uh, and he, he, he matches that description. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=832.4s)]
*  This guy is one of the best jump shooting bigs. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=835.28s)]
*  Defensively, he leaves a lot to be desired. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=838.76s)]
*  Um, but I think he's, he's a good player. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=842.52s)]
*  Um, and I wouldn't be surprised to see, you know, by the end of this week that [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=845.16s)]
*  he's, he's playing in a different uniform. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=848.84s)]
*  Um, so when you say a lot to be desired, you mean because he doesn't play defense? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=850.88s)]
*  I think his nickname was a layup line, if I'm not mistaken, but I might be, I [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=855.8s)]
*  might be mistaken on that. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=859.96s)]
*  You're being kind. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=861.04s)]
*  I like, I like how you are cutting guys down sometimes in the [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=861.6s)]
*  like nicest possible way. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=865.52s)]
*  He leaves a little bit desired. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=867.72s)]
*  Like, is he a guy you could maybe score 70 points against in the right game? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=869.28s)]
*  Yes, he is. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=873.16s)]
*  Uh, anyway, Chicago now we can add them to the whole, uh, to the, to the capture [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=874.64s)]
*  the flag sweepstakes, try to get in there. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=881.96s)]
*  Um, last thing I'll say, and then we can move on to the Lucatrade cause I'm really, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=885.36s)]
*  I really have other stuff I want to say about Luca and everything that happened. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=889.88s)]
*  This interesting moment for Darren Fox. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=893.76s)]
*  We see these guys call their shot, right? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=896.4s)]
*  These guys that push them, push their way to another team. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=900.12s)]
*  They're usually about half a level higher than Darren Fox, or they have some sort [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=902.76s)]
*  of playoff pedigree, like in Jimmy Butler's case, in this case, he doesn't have it. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=908.0s)]
*  I think he's a player we've all thought was really talented. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=913.12s)]
*  He's about to hit his late twenties. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=915.44s)]
*  We've seen him in the playoffs, you know, um, he didn't, he didn't leap out in any [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=917.7199999999999s)]
*  great way. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=923.24s)]
*  There's not some, it's not like some Anthony Davis that one year in the [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=923.64s)]
*  playoffs when he just laid waste to the Blazers. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=926.8s)]
*  He doesn't have any of that. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=929.52s)]
*  And I think we all think he's really good, but now this spotlight is completely [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=931.8s)]
*  different. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=934.8399999999999s)]
*  You're playing in Sacramento, you're buried. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=935.36s)]
*  You're just another team in the West with all these famous players and teams. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=937.4399999999999s)]
*  Now you're playing with the most famous international player that this league's [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=941.04s)]
*  going to have. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=943.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=945.1999999999999s)]
*  Different level of scrutiny and everything. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=945.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=948.0400000000001s)]
*  And it should be symbiotic. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=948.5200000000001s)]
*  These guys should make each other better. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=951.0s)]
*  Uh, the Aaron Fox's strengths should play into Victor Wemba, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=953.24s)]
*  Yama's strengths and vice versa. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=956.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=958.7600000000001s)]
*  The dude is, you know, lightning. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=959.2s)]
*  He's one of the faster players with the ball in his hand. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=962.72s)]
*  Do you think the Spurs want to play like that? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=964.84s)]
*  I think we have, are they going to want to push and run and go? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=967.32s)]
*  Is Wemby going to want to do that? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=969.6400000000001s)]
*  I mean, the first pass you look for, Victor Wemba, Yama gets a defensive rebound. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=971.4000000000001s)]
*  Now that first pass is okay. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=974.84s)]
*  Can he get Fox at mid court on this sort of Bill Walton style outlet pass or, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=976.96s)]
*  you know, this Kevin Love over yet. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=982.96s)]
*  So I think you, when you have Randy Moss, you throw the ball deep. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=984.88s)]
*  And I think you, when you, when you get this, this is not Chris Paul, right? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=988.96s)]
*  Like they've been playing with Chris Paul. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=992.76s)]
*  Uh, he's slowing everything down. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=994.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=995.9200000000001s)]
*  Cause he's old in a good way for him, but you know, so I think they will play [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=996.08s)]
*  fast and I think, you know, Victor at the five is one of the more, you know, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1000.0400000000001s)]
*  agile five men in the league. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1004.64s)]
*  So I think they will, you'll see that pace number creep up in San Antonio. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1006.24s)]
*  Uh, you have, you have a bunch of young guys now, so I think they will play to [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1010.9599999999999s)]
*  his strengths and he should get some easy buckets, you know, when we block [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1016.0799999999999s)]
*  and he's a crunch time guy for them too. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1020.76s)]
*  It would be the other piece. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1022.3199999999999s)]
*  Crunch time. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1023.92s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1024.8799999999999s)]
*  Um, the shooting has always been his, his, his challenge, but like, if you look at [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1026.08s)]
*  his free throw number, which is what us nerds look at, it's great. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1031.88s)]
*  He shoots 80% from the free throw line. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1034.92s)]
*  That should be a 40% three point shooter. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1037.3600000000001s)]
*  It just hasn't been there. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1039.24s)]
*  I'd love to see him as he goes into sort of his late twenties become a 37, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1040.0800000000002s)]
*  38, 40% three point shooter. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1046.4s)]
*  He hasn't done that yet. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1048.5200000000002s)]
*  Uh, and that's the thing that could take him over the top and make [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1050.0800000000002s)]
*  this a triumph for the Spurs. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1053.5600000000002s)]
*  Um, but he has, he has a lot of potential here. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1055.5200000000002s)]
*  Uh, and, and you're right. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1060.0400000000002s)]
*  It's a, it's a laser focused for him. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1061.44s)]
*  Crunch time Fox, Castle, Vasell, maybe Sohan, Wemby. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1064.3600000000001s)]
*  It's a pretty good defensive team. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1072.52s)]
*  It's not going to make a lot of threes. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1074.64s)]
*  They're going to be some bad shots, but defensively that's a pretty interesting [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1077.16s)]
*  team and you'd probably, I guess, target Fox and go after them and try to put [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1081.8s)]
*  them in pick and rolls, but other than that, um, those are all guys that, um, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1085.2s)]
*  I think would be in pretty good shape. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1089.64s)]
*  Anyway, interesting trade. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1091.08s)]
*  Anytime you can get San Antonio, Sacramento, and the mediocre Bulls [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1093.04s)]
*  together for a three teamer, uh, you just thank your lucky stars. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy3hSLEJxd4&t=1097.6799999999998s)]
