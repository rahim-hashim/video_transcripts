# What Does Firing Michael Malone Do? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY)
*  A true stunner. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=0.0s)]
*  I don't remember. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1.28s)]
*  I have a bunch of thoughts on this, but to fire your coach at GM with a [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1.96s)]
*  week to go in the season, when you have a chance to be like a top four [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=5.36s)]
*  playoff seed, this is like the NBA we grew up with the NBA is like, like [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=8.16s)]
*  going nuts again. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=13.64s)]
*  Well, I mean, it is, and it isn't like there, there is no precedent for [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=14.72s)]
*  teams firing their co like we have it now in 10 days to playoff teams with [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=20.0s)]
*  legit aspirations for getting to the Western conference finals, firing [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=26.0s)]
*  their head coach and Denver Memphis Memphis being the other one. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=31.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=35.88s)]
*  Denver. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=36.44s)]
*  Whole step further. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=38.28s)]
*  They're like, we don't like the internal turmoil of this identity crisis fight [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=39.44s)]
*  that we've been having for what feels like to me, 18 months now, at least [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=45.56s)]
*  between Calvin booth and his instinct to try and build a team with young guys. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  And Mike Malone who has in front of him, most of the pieces of guys that won an [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=55.279999999999994s)]
*  NBA championship a couple of years ago. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=60.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=62.599999999999994s)]
*  Uh, and this tension has been affecting this team for two years now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  Well, but think back to the eighties though. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=67.39999999999999s)]
*  I remember didn't Larry Brown, like he was coaching the nets and he just [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  left for Kansas city with, or for Kansas university with like two weeks [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=73.96s)]
*  to go in the season, they fired him. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=77.72s)]
*  It was the kind of thing that would happen all the time with the league we [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=79.4s)]
*  loved in the league, even though it still has your Sacramento's and these. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=81.88s)]
*  But now I feel like here's my theory. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=86.19999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to throw this theory. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  I'm listening. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=90.32s)]
*  The league is so deep now and there's so much talent. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=90.84s)]
*  It ties into something we talked about when we did the over under pods with [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=93.88s)]
*  Brasilla it's like, shit, there's going to be some unhappy teams, teams that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=96.96s)]
*  thought they were going to be really good teams that have max guys teams that have [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=102.44s)]
*  this model that used to work of, we have three stars, we have two really good [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  stars and they're going to be like two games under 500 in February. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=110.16s)]
*  Wondering what that'll happen. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=114.8s)]
*  And I'm looking at the West because the West is a way deeper conference in the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=116.36s)]
*  East. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=120.0s)]
*  The East is more like a traditional, you have the really good teams, you have [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=120.28s)]
*  some good playoff teams, some mediocre teams and then crappy teams, right? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=124.24s)]
*  That's the model we're used to the West. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=128.88s)]
*  Like everybody's talented and everybody thought they were going to be in the mix. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=131.24s)]
*  So look at all the teams that weren't happy just this season. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=134.88s)]
*  Dallas traded their best player. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=138.24s)]
*  One of the five best guys in the league. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=141.0s)]
*  They just said, fuck it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=142.52s)]
*  We don't like where this is going. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=143.56s)]
*  They trade them. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=144.8s)]
*  The Lakers were unhappy too. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=145.76s)]
*  There was, they were trying to do all kinds of stuff mid season. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=147.24s)]
*  They make a trade. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=149.88s)]
*  Memphis fires their coach. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=151.12s)]
*  Denver just fired their coach at GM. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=153.48s)]
*  Sacramento fired their coach, traded their best player. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=155.56s)]
*  Phoenix tried to trade everybody on their team, but Devin Booker for four months. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=159.6s)]
*  They fired their coach last year. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=165.52s)]
*  They're probably firing them again. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=166.84s)]
*  That's six teams in the West house. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=168.48s)]
*  Well, you left out Golden state and Golden state who knew that they needed another [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=170.48s)]
*  piece and went and paid, you know, high price. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=174.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=177.84s)]
*  But at least that's not like, okay. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=178.4s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=181.36s)]
*  That's not a hail Mary. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=181.52s)]
*  This Denver thing is a hail Mary. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=183.0s)]
*  This is what the hell is going on to me. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=185.32s)]
*  We're going to the playoffs and we're going to get smoked and everybody wants to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=189.16s)]
*  play us and we're in a situation where in Saturday, Sunday teams might be tanking [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=192.12s)]
*  to try to get a matchup against us. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=196.56s)]
*  That's the level Denver was at with the way they were playing lately. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=198.8s)]
*  That's true. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  So what does firing the coach and GM have to do with the performance on the floor? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=207.2s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=207.44s)]
*  I'm going to try to answer it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=208.28s)]
*  Good. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=209.32s)]
*  I think they thought their season was shot. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=210.56s)]
*  I think they decided, I think they're right. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  This coach GM situation, they were going to get rid of both of them. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=215.28s)]
*  Josh Cronkite basically said that in the press conference. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=218.96s)]
*  We're going to do something after the season. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=221.84s)]
*  Why not now? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=224.04s)]
*  Why not see if we can save it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=224.8s)]
*  Um, this is a Hail Mary. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=226.96s)]
*  Well, what again, let's do it precedent wise. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=228.92000000000002s)]
*  Point to a team that's done this with a week to go in the last three years. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=232.88s)]
*  A team that's had Jokic as, as their best player during like this half decade. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=237.84s)]
*  He's having, that's one of the great half decades. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=243.32s)]
*  Anyone's had offensively in the history of the league. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=245.88s)]
*  So I don't, they have one title to show for it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=248.08s)]
*  I don't begrudge the instinct of wanting to do something to change the trajectory, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=250.04s)]
*  but the problem is it's the players. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=256.24s)]
*  They're not good enough. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=260.2s)]
*  They don't have a team that's good enough to compete to your observation. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=261.71999999999997s)]
*  Earlier. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=266.4s)]
*  They're tough. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=266.76s)]
*  I've got it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=267.2s)]
*  They don't play defense. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=269.15999999999997s)]
*  They haven't played defense in two months. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=270.56s)]
*  That's why they have a losing record over their last 25, 30 games. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=273.15999999999997s)]
*  It's why they have a, a, they're five and nine over their last 14 games. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=277.96s)]
*  Their last three games. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=282.0s)]
*  Five and nine over the last 14. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=284.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=285.0s)]
*  I saw their 12 and 13 last 25. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=285.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=287.44s)]
*  They don't play defense. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=288.44s)]
*  19th net rating, 22nd defensive rating in their last 25 games. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=289.56s)]
*  And we like looking at the net rating stuff. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=295.2s)]
*  It's a nice little snapshot. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=296.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=298.24s)]
*  You know, sometimes you can overreact to it one way or the other. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=299.24s)]
*  Sometimes you have teams that are in the vicinity of where their [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=302.0s)]
*  playoff spot's going to be. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  Maybe they cool the jets a little bit. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=305.96000000000004s)]
*  Other times it's a real sign. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=308.36s)]
*  Either something's going really wrong or really right. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=310.92s)]
*  Like with the Clippers with Kawhi back, all their net rating stuff is really [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=313.04s)]
*  good here for two solid months now. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=316.6s)]
*  And it's like, let's take this team seriously. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=318.56s)]
*  Detroit, who I think is going to be a six seed. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=320.6s)]
*  I'm not taking them a hundred percent seriously, but the math is the math. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=323.88s)]
*  And the math says they're a pretty good team. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=327.20000000000005s)]
*  Denver, the math said this team can't guard anybody. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=329.56s)]
*  The on-off stats with Yokeage, which I mentioned Sunday with Rosillo. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=333.20000000000005s)]
*  Um, and are the case if you're going to talk MVP for him, which I think, I [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=337.08000000000004s)]
*  think today probably hurt that cause a little bit. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=341.72s)]
*  Um, but the on-off for him where they were the best offense in NBA history [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=344.0s)]
*  when he, when he's on the court and their 30th in the NBA, when he's off the court. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=348.48s)]
*  That's all you need to know. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=352.12s)]
*  And there's never been a disparity like that in the history of basketball. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=353.48s)]
*  That tells you. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=357.12s)]
*  It's all that you need to know about the team building effort. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=359.0s)]
*  And look, I think this is, well, when you say team building, though, do you blame [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=363.44000000000005s)]
*  Mike Malone at all for, cause you and I both watch a lot of Denver. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=367.32000000000005s)]
*  I don't blame him one bit. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=370.76s)]
*  No. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=372.24s)]
*  I mean, when you have the best player on earth and you have most of the nucleus [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=372.88s)]
*  of a title winning team, then the appropriate thing to do is try and in the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=378.6s)]
*  first place, defend that title. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=382.68s)]
*  And then in the second place, try and win as many as you can while you have the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=384.32s)]
*  best player in the world playing at the level that he's playing at, that seems [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=388.48s)]
*  like the right kind of decision. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=392.84s)]
*  And I think that head coach, you know, built a game plan for the season. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=395.2s)]
*  These last two seasons around the, that, that thesis around the idea of we should [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=399.44s)]
*  try really hard when we have this guy to be as good as we can in this moment. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=404.48s)]
*  They just, I do think that this new collective bargaining agreement is a real [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=409.92s)]
*  culprit is a real, the apron stuff. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=414.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=416.76s)]
*  Cause they were, so they were like 5 million under the second apron, but next [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=417.04s)]
*  year they were going to get killed by the apron and I think they seem really scared [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=421.36s)]
*  of it and you know, there's some real money stuff with this team that has to be [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=425.16s)]
*  mentioned. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=428.72s)]
*  I think around the league, if you talk to people who know shit or who have a vested [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=430.0s)]
*  interest in it, they're like, thank God Denver's not spending more money. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=435.72s)]
*  They have this incredible asset and they seem pretty good being middle of the road. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=440.28000000000003s)]
*  It's the same thing people felt about the New England Patriots during the last 10 [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=444.08000000000004s)]
*  years of Tom Brady. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=447.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, thank God they're not spending more than they are. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=448.40000000000003s)]
*  Then you look at the Philadelphia Eagles in your division and they're super [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=450.76000000000005s)]
*  aggressive and they're like trying to maximize the moment. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=454.48s)]
*  I think that's what most fans want. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=457.44s)]
*  I would not say Denver's doing that. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=459.2s)]
*  I don't, I wouldn't call it Denver middle of the road. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=460.84s)]
*  I wouldn't characterize. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=463.0s)]
*  I'd say middle of the road. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=464.71999999999997s)]
*  They have the, they have the best player in the league and they're not even a [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=465.96s)]
*  second apron team. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=468.88s)]
*  Well, they're going to be middle of the road this season. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=469.84s)]
*  They were not middle. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=473.0s)]
*  They, they went for it last season and I think they paid the price. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=473.92s)]
*  I think they flamed out the way they did because they, they saw the one [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=477.08s)]
*  seed as a viable possibility. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=480.88s)]
*  They played balls to the wall at the end of the regular season and it took a toll [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=483.24s)]
*  on them because Minnesota ran them out the gym. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=486.84s)]
*  I have a couple other theories in this. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=490.03999999999996s)]
*  The plan I think puts a crazy amount of pressure on these teams. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=492.15999999999997s)]
*  Not only do you not want to be in the plan, you're in a situation where you [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=496.23999999999995s)]
*  could just lose two playing games. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=499.03999999999996s)]
*  Then you're not even in the playoffs, which was a real thing for Denver, right? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=500.44s)]
*  True story. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=503.59999999999997s)]
*  So this is why it's, it's not a panic move, but it's a total panic move where [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=504.12s)]
*  you're like five days left. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=509.28s)]
*  Everybody wants to play us our defenses in shambles. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=510.64s)]
*  We lost a catastrophic game in overtime to Minnesota that really feels like that [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=514.5999999999999s)]
*  tilted their season and all these different ways, like this Malone still have [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=521.0799999999999s)]
*  a job if they win that game, maybe. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=524.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, they didn't play two of their guys that game, right? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=525.9599999999999s)]
*  I mean, I know, but it was just how they lost and how bad Westbrook was. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=528.5999999999999s)]
*  It was, and how great Yocage was. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=532.12s)]
*  It was agonizing. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=534.5999999999999s)]
*  So you have that piece. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=535.76s)]
*  Um, you know, a lot of times when we're hinting at stuff and pods and we're [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=537.52s)]
*  talking about stuff and we're talking about scuttlebutt around the league and [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=542.88s)]
*  people go, where's that coming from? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=547.04s)]
*  And shit gets aggregated, but it always seemed hazy. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=548.52s)]
*  This booth Malone thing. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=552.72s)]
*  I mean, I talked about it. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=554.84s)]
*  I, everybody who's had a podcast has alluded to or talked about it. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=556.24s)]
*  I almost, and I really regret I didn't do it. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=559.8s)]
*  I had it, you know, you have the tweet lined up and you have the draft. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=562.56s)]
*  There was some something Malone got something for like, he won the [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=566.52s)]
*  most games and nuggets history. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=570.24s)]
*  There was some sort of ceremony and it was like a short video and it was [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=571.6s)]
*  Calvin booth, giving him something. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=574.44s)]
*  And I had this really sarcastic tweet and it was like rare footage of Calvin [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=576.76s)]
*  booth and Mike Malone interacting. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=581.44s)]
*  And I was ready to tweet it out and I was like, you know what? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=584.12s)]
*  That's not worth it. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=586.6s)]
*  That's going to become a thing. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=587.48s)]
*  People will be mad. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=589.0400000000001s)]
*  Like, and I was just like, I didn't do it, but that's how bad it was. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=590.28s)]
*  I had this tweet lined up like, because just that they interacted seemed [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=593.8000000000001s)]
*  like it was an amazing event. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=598.0400000000001s)]
*  I don't like that whole kind of storyline and that dynamic because at the end of [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=600.5999999999999s)]
*  the day, the media part of it or the coach GM part, the coach GM part, the [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=607.7199999999999s)]
*  media part of it is perfectly fine. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=611.8399999999999s)]
*  Well, you know, we're getting the, now they tell us piece TM Brian Curtis, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=614.0s)]
*  you know, that's coming. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=618.52s)]
*  It was an open secret. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=619.4399999999999s)]
*  Like, you know, Ramona kind of wrote it in the beginning of season. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=620.8399999999999s)]
*  I think Zach, if Zach had been writing for ESPN, I think Zach would have had [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=624.3199999999999s)]
*  something pretty major at some point. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=629.24s)]
*  Matt Moore at the action network, who's a, you know, does a pod on, on Denver [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=630.92s)]
*  has been talking about, it's not a secret of that. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=635.88s)]
*  No, all the Denver fans. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=638.64s)]
*  Internal tension. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=639.76s)]
*  They've been observing it, but really it's more than tension. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=640.6s)]
*  They didn't fucking talk. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=643.28s)]
*  I don't like it because that's on Cronkite. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=644.2s)]
*  That's on Josh Cronkite. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=646.72s)]
*  They're like, you, you, somebody needs to be the boss. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=648.6s)]
*  At least he owned it today. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=650.72s)]
*  The boss is the boss, right? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=651.64s)]
*  You, you see guys not getting along. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=653.48s)]
*  You need to sit in a room and reconcile whatever the differences are. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=655.76s)]
*  Because again, you have the best effing player on the planet, on your team, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=660.16s)]
*  playing at his absolute best. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=665.04s)]
*  So the thing to do is try and capitalize on that. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=667.6s)]
*  That would be my instinct. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=672.16s)]
*  So you don't think you didn't think of Zeke Nagy extension, Reggie Jackson, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=673.4s)]
*  Peyton Watson, who could be something eventually, maybe someday. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=679.1999999999999s)]
*  There's some really bad team building. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=683.6s)]
*  We knew there might be signs of trouble. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=685.8s)]
*  Kevin O'Connor, when he was writing for the ringer, did that big piece about [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=688.4s)]
*  the nuggets and their team building and Calvin Booth gave all these secrets in [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=691.52s)]
*  the piece, which is like GM 101. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=695.28s)]
*  Don't do that. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=698.12s)]
*  If you're doing stuff that's working, don't talk about it. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=698.92s)]
*  What is the upside? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=701.56s)]
*  What's the upside of, of here? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=702.96s)]
*  Let me tell this reporter. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=705.12s)]
*  All of these things we're doing that we think are cutting edge. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=707.04s)]
*  How are you winning with that? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=710.08s)]
*  Now you're just giving your secrets to the other 29 teams in the league. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=711.2s)]
*  Again. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=714.16s)]
*  And he does this whole link thing and it was just weird because it felt credit [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=714.56s)]
*  grabby and anytime something's credit grabby, you know, like, well, why is this [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=717.8399999999999s)]
*  guy doing it? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=723.4799999999999s)]
*  Obviously he had a thing with Malone and it was already there jacking. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=724.0799999999999s)]
*  Where's the boss. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=728.3599999999999s)]
*  When that story came out on the ringer, which is what 18 months ago, 16 months [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=729.68s)]
*  ago, remember he tried to disown it after he was like, I don't know. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=733.76s)]
*  I thought I was off the record. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=736.4399999999999s)]
*  And he was, oh right. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=737.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=738.9599999999999s)]
*  He's ludicrous. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=739.28s)]
*  It was fucking bullshit. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=740.1199999999999s)]
*  Cause KFC did a good job with that story. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=741.1199999999999s)]
*  Um, anyway, so that this thing was a problem all year. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=743.4399999999999s)]
*  I think it affected the team and then they finally acted. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=746.92s)]
*  I'm gonna throw this at you. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=750.3199999999999s)]
*  The great NBA asset wastes. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=752.4399999999999s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=755.8399999999999s)]
*  So remember when we were kids and Kareem was just on shitty teams for like seven [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=756.88s)]
*  years, he was on the bucks forever. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=760.76s)]
*  They had nobody like basically Bobby Dandridge and that was it. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=763.12s)]
*  Oscar was washed up. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=766.24s)]
*  Um, and they were, he was still great. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=768.0799999999999s)]
*  And then finally he's like, I'm going that way. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=769.8s)]
*  Goes to the Lakers, but they trade a lot to get him. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=771.8000000000001s)]
*  Then the Kermit Washington fight happens. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=775.08s)]
*  And it's just, it felt like there's seven years there. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=776.9200000000001s)]
*  It was like, Jesus, this cream, he's the best part in the league. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=779.7600000000001s)]
*  He's going to be on a really good team. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=782.24s)]
*  And then magic shows up and, um, the rest is history, but there's been [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=783.72s)]
*  some good ones over the years, like even LeBron in the mid two [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=787.5600000000001s)]
*  thousands on those Cleveland teams. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=790.12s)]
*  I was like, oh man, they're trading for Ben Wallace now. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=792.4000000000001s)]
*  Uh, oh, they're paying that much for Anton Jameson. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=795.8000000000001s)]
*  Kobe mid two thousands, partly his fault because it's your checkup. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=799.72s)]
*  TMAC for basically the entire two thousands. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=803.2s)]
*  That makes me sad. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=806.24s)]
*  That was a good one. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=807.0s)]
*  Moses, when we were kids on the Rockets, TMAC could have, but [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=807.76s)]
*  y'all broke down on them. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=811.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=813.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=813.24s)]
*  I broke down, but TMAC for all that Orlando run when Green Hill was hurt. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=813.44s)]
*  It makes me sad. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=817.28s)]
*  Um, yeah. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=818.08s)]
*  And I don't think this Yocach thing is as bad cause I, Gordon's obviously [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=819.04s)]
*  really good Christian Brown's been good. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=822.64s)]
*  Murray, when he's healthy is good. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=824.5600000000001s)]
*  Turned out to be good. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=826.04s)]
*  Uh, Porter's a good three point shooter. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=827.16s)]
*  It's not, it's not that bad, but at the same time, their entire, it does hurt. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=828.96s)]
*  Their entire fate is tied to Jamal Murray's health. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=832.6800000000001s)]
*  And we said this at the outset of the season. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=836.0400000000001s)]
*  I know, I'm not sure if I'm the only one, but I went under on them getting [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=838.24s)]
*  the 51 wins this, this season because you went over on the Sixers. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=843.0400000000001s)]
*  No, I'm just saying we're talking about the Denver Nuggets. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=848.08s)]
*  I didn't want you to applaud yourself because you did go. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=850.1600000000001s)]
*  No, by the way, I went, I went under on the Clippers and under on the Lakers. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=852.96s)]
*  Why are we going through this? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=857.9200000000001s)]
*  Nobody cares. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=859.1600000000001s)]
*  I only, the observation I'm making is that the concern at the outset of the [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=860.48s)]
*  season for me was Jamal Murray. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=865.08s)]
*  Do you trust that he's going to be able to play at the level that this team [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=866.76s)]
*  requires through the balance of the season for them to get into like the mid [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=869.96s)]
*  fifties and wins and I didn't trust it at any time that he's not, he has been [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=873.32s)]
*  excellent Jamal Murray for a good stretch and they were, they won eight [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=877.88s)]
*  games going into the All-Star. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=882.36s)]
*  I was like, welcome to the season Jamal Murray. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=883.72s)]
*  Yeah, but you know, it was like, okay, so Denver is legit. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=885.36s)]
*  So we love Denver at this level playing at that, that, you know, and then [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=888.48s)]
*  Gordon went out with, with some injuries and Michael Porter Jr has been doing [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=892.36s)]
*  Michael Porter Jr stuff and we have too much time and too many high leverage [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=895.6800000000001s)]
*  moments where the basketball finds its way into Russell Westbrook's hands. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=901.96s)]
*  Well, he just shouldn't play in crunch time. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=906.04s)]
*  That's true. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=907.6s)]
*  I must don't blame Russell Westbrook. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=908.08s)]
*  I don't either. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=909.04s)]
*  I don't blame him. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=910.28s)]
*  When my son leaves the pantry open and, and the dog, my, my, my beloved dog [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=911.04s)]
*  Murph is just like, cool, I'm going to eat all the potato chips. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=916.4399999999999s)]
*  Is that Murph's fault or is that Ben's fault? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=919.9599999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=921.76s)]
*  That's right. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=922.68s)]
*  Russ sometimes in crunch time, he's just going to eat all the potato chips. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=923.1999999999999s)]
*  And it's like, you left the pantry open. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=926.24s)]
*  He has to be on the floor doing that though, because they are trying to [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=927.8399999999999s)]
*  do this rotating rest thing with their guys. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=931.4s)]
*  I get it too. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=934.64s)]
*  They're just not good enough. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=935.28s)]
*  Here's, here's Russ's value. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=936.4399999999999s)]
*  We're giving everyone the night off. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=938.64s)]
*  Russ, can you do everything and try to keep us close for this game [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=940.16s)]
*  against Charlotte who's thinking anyway? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=943.8399999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=945.48s)]
*  Can we bring in conspiracy bill for a second? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=946.0s)]
*  I'm here. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=948.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm listening. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=948.76s)]
*  He's terribly, he turned his hat backwards. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=950.88s)]
*  It's like an over the top slice alarm conspiracy bill. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=954.04s)]
*  I wonder if Jamal Murray is healthy. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=958.92s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=961.36s)]
*  And if they feel like they're going, teams going the wrong way in the [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=963.28s)]
*  playoffs and Jamal Murray is not a hundred percent healthy and they lose. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=967.12s)]
*  And then that becomes the excuse for why they fell apart down the stretch. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=972.16s)]
*  And then it becomes harder to clean house and fire everybody. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=976.64s)]
*  And now you just do it now. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=981.44s)]
*  So there's no excuse. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=983.28s)]
*  You 50 50, maybe he's going to be where he was in December for the playoffs. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=985.48s)]
*  Maybe not, but either way, it's a queen. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=989.76s)]
*  It's a reset button either way. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=991.64s)]
*  It's just, listen, I'm not saying conspiracy bill. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=993.28s)]
*  Oh, I'm still conspiracy bill. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=996.28s)]
*  You're feels like I'm back. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=997.6s)]
*  I'm out. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=999.0s)]
*  That good. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=999.4399999999999s)]

*  I'm not saying he's always right. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1001.9599999999999s)]
*  Sometimes he's crazy, but something doesn't pass the sniff test [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1003.76s)]
*  about the timing with this. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1007.7199999999999s)]
*  I don't because it's ludicrous. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1009.0s)]
*  The timing is the timing is ludicrous. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1011.4399999999999s)]
*  There's nothing. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1013.12s)]
*  I mean, Josh Crocky said four times, we're going to see what we can squeeze. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1013.6s)]
*  Squeeze the juice. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1016.9599999999999s)]
*  We're going to see if we can squeeze some juice out of it. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1017.88s)]
*  There ain't no juice buddy. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1020.56s)]
*  Your team ain't good enough. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1021.9599999999999s)]
*  He's, he needs to squeeze the PD juice out of it. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1023.3199999999999s)]
*  He should be squeezing. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1026.04s)]
*  He's all the way around. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1027.0s)]
*  He needs to be squeezing the leadership juice. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1028.3999999999999s)]
*  He should have squeezed, squoze, you know, before the season started and sat down. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1030.6s)]
*  He needed, it needed to be squeezed before the season started. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1035.28s)]
*  They needed to come up with a game plan and not have this internal turmoil. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1038.0s)]
*  They got a best case scenario out of Christian Brown. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1043.76s)]
*  Does this, this season, they got a very good scenario. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1046.48s)]
*  Dodging the KCP bullet. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1049.8s)]
*  They got a very good scenario out of Jamal Murray. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1052.44s)]
*  Honestly. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1055.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1055.96s)]
*  It could mean considering his injury history, they pay, they have three max contract guys. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1056.28s)]
*  They can't keep all three. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1061.8400000000001s)]
*  They can't keep Aaron Gordon and Michael Porter Jr. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1062.88s)]
*  And Jamal Murray and stay, you know, where they want to be. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1065.72s)]
*  Like Porter Jr. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbciK6bxTIY&t=1068.56s)]
