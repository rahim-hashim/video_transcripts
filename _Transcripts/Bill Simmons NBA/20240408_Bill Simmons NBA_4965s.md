# The 2024 Made-Up NBA Awards | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=0.0s)]
*  We created a bunch of awards. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=0.4s)]
*  They're really fun. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=5.0200000000000005s)]
*  I'm really excited for some of your answers. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=7.16s)]
*  We're going to start with the unicorn of the year in a word that I didn't even [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=10.6s)]
*  tell you about. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=13.88s)]
*  I'm going to give you not, by the way, I'm just sitting here going, Oh, we're [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  off to a good start. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=18.88s)]
*  You didn't send me that one. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=19.92s)]
*  Well, I'm going to give you, I'm going to give you the nominees and you can blind [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  check unicorn of the year. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=24.2s)]
*  I think this is pretty easy, but our nominees, Victor Wemba Nyama. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=25.68s)]
*  Zion Williamson, Christophe Porzingis and Giannis Antetokounmpo. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=30.8s)]
*  Who is your unicorn of the year? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=37.44s)]
*  It's Wemba Nyama. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=40.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=41.72s)]
*  That's why I didn't prep you on that one. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=42.2s)]
*  Remember, I remember writing a column for the ringer, I think 17, when we [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=45.08s)]
*  were in like full unicorn frenzy, it was like Porzingis and Bede, Giannis. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=48.72s)]
*  We were all of a sudden, we had all these guys coming to the league at the same time. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=53.32s)]
*  We were like, I've never seen that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=56.32s)]
*  I've never seen anything like that before. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=57.84s)]
*  And there was just a bunch of them and it was super fun. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=59.36s)]
*  That's what Wemba has been like this year. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=61.88s)]
*  We're going to keep talking about him because the next award, which I did prep [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=63.4s)]
*  you for, it's the 2011 Blake Griffin award for most unexpected delight. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=67.84s)]
*  This is you head into the season. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=75.6s)]
*  You don't know this awesome thing is going to happen over the course of the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=78.08s)]
*  season and then it's happening. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=80.76s)]
*  You're like, wow, what a bonus. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=82.6s)]
*  I didn't realize, I didn't realize this was going to be part of my NBA fandom [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=84.64s)]
*  this year, so our nominees are basically Wemba's last six weeks, Anthony Edwards [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=88.6s)]
*  becoming a throwback eighties, nineties superstar or the in-season tournament, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=95.91999999999999s)]
*  which I think all of us were down on and turned out to be really fun. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=103.6s)]
*  We all watched it, enjoyed it, got content out of it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=108.08s)]
*  So your pick, Wemba, Ant or the in-season tournament? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=110.44s)]
*  In-season tournament, because once I understood it and that it wasn't really [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=114.56s)]
*  going to disrupt the schedule at all, and then you figure out that the NBA is trying [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=117.4s)]
*  to have more event driven revenue, you know, one of their products, whether it [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=120.76s)]
*  was the playing game, whether it was the in-season tournament, and now that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=125.2s)]
*  everybody's been through it for a year and they'll understand what the pods mean. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=128.04000000000002s)]
*  And then once we understood the score differential and getting to go see it [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=132.52s)]
*  and how intense those games were, other than the Zion game, which was like his [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  low point, that was the second. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  Necessary like in a weird way, it was his Rocky three getting yelled at by [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=144.04s)]
*  injured on the beach moment, like he had to get a shit together. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=148.28s)]
*  So if, if I can be allowed to not like, if those are the nominees, because I had a [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=151.64s)]
*  different one. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=156.88s)]
*  Oh God. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=157.95999999999998s)]
*  I was going to say. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=158.28s)]
*  Well, if there's an extra nominee, by all means throw it in. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=158.56s)]
*  Cause it's unexpected delight and it's Kyrie like, Oh, Hey, when you just play [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  basketball and it's, and it's just, it's just about the basketball and your [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  basketball happy. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=171.6s)]
*  I mean, this is awesome. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=173.88s)]
*  What he's doing. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=174.84s)]
*  It's, it's a reminder of why I think so many people have been frustrated. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=175.48s)]
*  And look, the frustration for him is well deserved, but when it's just [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=179.48s)]
*  basketball, it's, it's awesome. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  I had this coming up in a later award, but I'm delighted to do this now. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=189.68s)]
*  I couldn't agree more. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=193.79999999999998s)]
*  He was so much fun today. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=195.2s)]
*  I've enjoyed watching his whole season. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=196.4s)]
*  I think, you know, especially when we do this for a living and it's easy, you [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=198.2s)]
*  know, everything has to be, you're either for somebody or against somebody. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=203.76s)]
*  It's positive or negative. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=207.23999999999998s)]
*  And every fan base, you hate my guy or you, you know, Oh, he likes our guy. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=208.67999999999998s)]
*  So he's good. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=212.92s)]
*  We were frustrated with Kyrie for all those years, cause he's such a unique [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  talent. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=218.2s)]
*  It's like, get your shit together. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=219.56s)]
*  We want to just watch you play basketball and, and just be part of a winning team. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=220.64s)]
*  And we don't want any of the baggage. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=224.67999999999998s)]
*  Just be fun to watch, which is selfish. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=226.04s)]
*  Cause we're fans, but I think that's where all the frustration came from. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=228.08s)]
*  Like when he played for the Celtics, that first 16, 17 games, when they had the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=232.08s)]
*  streak, he was incredibly fun to watch. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  Like we were all like, couldn't have been happier to have them on the team. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=238.84s)]
*  Then the next year it was the opposite. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=242.12s)]
*  And I think there's been such swings with him, but just fundamentally the guy can do [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=243.68s)]
*  shit that no guard in the history league has been able to do. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  He is to me, the most coordinated left-handed, right-handed. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=250.56s)]
*  Just, I don't even know what his dominant side is kind of a guy out of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=255.24s)]
*  any buddy I've ever watched. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=259.84s)]
*  If there's no shot he can't make, there's no direction he can't go. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=261.52s)]
*  I think he would be impossible to guard. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=265.8s)]
*  And you can see why the other players really respect them. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=267.28s)]
*  And I think what he's doing this year is what we always wanted to see, but I'd [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=269.8s)]
*  given up on it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=273.56s)]
*  Like hadn't you, I never, I never in a million years thought this was happening [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=274.36s)]
*  again with him. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=278.12s)]
*  No, because when he was a free agent, I mean, think about how bad the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=279.56s)]
*  market was for him. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=282.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=283.76s)]
*  There was no market. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=284.68s)]
*  I can't get into business with him, but if you're Dallas, you do with a lot of [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=285.48s)]
*  teams, you're going, I guess we'll just do the extension. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=289.16s)]
*  And the part of it was like, why is it that number? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=291.12s)]
*  And it's like, well, if you bring them in at a lower number based on what the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=292.76s)]
*  demand is for him, then you may have a problem. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=295.2s)]
*  Like he actually got paid as insurance against like him bailing on a team again. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=297.56s)]
*  So, there's, there's no part of me that's like, I don't like when this happens, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=303.44s)]
*  when a guy plays well, then all of a sudden it's like, you know, guys really [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=309.84s)]
*  overreacted. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=312.52s)]
*  Like, no, he didn't. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=313.72s)]
*  Yeah, it didn't. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=314.88s)]
*  It was, it was a consistent mess for a ton of years. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=315.68s)]
*  And then get to see it today. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=319.12s)]
*  Six, six straight years where something was funky or off or really horrible. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=320.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=326.52s)]
*  So you see today and granted, it was a couple of things that happened in the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=326.92s)]
*  game against Houston, which was a lot of fun. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=329.96000000000004s)]
*  Thompson gets thrown out of the game for chucking an elbow at Maxie's throat. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=332.8s)]
*  So now you're down to defender, Jane Lee green, you got in the foul trouble. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=337.64s)]
*  So they ended up with Van Vliet on them and then Houston matched Dallas by going [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=340.64s)]
*  small. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=344.08s)]
*  So it was a free for all Lucas exhausted. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=345.0s)]
*  And then I think he was actually limping a bit there towards the end of the game, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=348.84s)]
*  but it was all on Kyrie where based on the lack of size and the defensive [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=351.92s)]
*  matchups and the lack of just, everybody was exhausted because what kind of grind [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=357.12s)]
*  this game was to see him just be like, Hey, Kyrie, you're going to have to like [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=361.76s)]
*  solve every possession. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=365.24s)]
*  And he basically did. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=366.68s)]
*  And it was just fun. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=368.6s)]
*  Like, if you like basketball, you're just going, okay, this is, I don't care. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=369.44s)]
*  Like what I think about him. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=371.96s)]
*  I don't know that I want to give him a three year extension over a hundred [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=373.0s)]
*  million bucks, but today, and for so many games now with Dallas on this run, it's [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=375.04s)]
*  just been a fun reminder to be like, this is actually why we've talked about you [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=379.24s)]
*  so much because there's been frustration. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=382.28s)]
*  Cause you know how good you are. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=383.88s)]
*  I wonder if like just Katie passing through his life was this thing that just [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=386.03999999999996s)]
*  sent him sideways for, you know, even you think that last Celtics year when it [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=392.0s)]
*  was pretty obvious, those guys were designing to play together and that kind [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=395.44s)]
*  of screwed up. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=398.52s)]
*  That was one of the things that screwed up the last Celtics year, then the [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=399.03999999999996s)]
*  Brooklyn COVID, the vaccine, James Harden, all the things that happened. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=401.4s)]
*  Well, the suspension is the one too, where you're just like, all right, you [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=406.4s)]
*  know, go ahead. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=409.56s)]
*  He's not, he's only allowed to play home games. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=410.56s)]
*  We're just, we're going, we're going, we're going away games. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=413.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=416.71999999999997s)]
*  Um, but it's just like now that the Rance moved on, Kyrie moved on and when he's [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=417.2s)]
*  playing next to an awesome player, it seems like it brings the best out of them. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=423.15999999999997s)]
*  It's just the way. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=426.88s)]
*  I don't know if he could be the focal point, the number one guy on a really good [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=427.48s)]
*  team, but when he's like the kind of the Robin who can come in and beat up some [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=431.36s)]
*  bad guys every once in a while, it seems like that's, that's where we've seen him [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=435.36s)]
*  thrive the most, but I'm with you. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=438.32s)]
*  It's been really fun to watch him play basketball. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=440.20000000000005s)]
*  I'm just like, I like watching basketball. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=442.6s)]
*  I like watching talented players. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=444.64000000000004s)]
*  So if you're going to do well, great. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=446.20000000000005s)]
*  More talented players for us. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=448.20000000000005s)]
*  Um, I'm voting for Wembe's last month for that award, by the way. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=450.20000000000005s)]
*  Hard to argue. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=456.36s)]
*  It's like that Knicks game. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=456.76s)]
*  I mean that, that like sent me to a whole other level with that. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=460.96s)]
*  Cause I was actively just trying not to watch too much spurs. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=464.12s)]
*  Cause they made me so mad. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=466.96s)]
*  And that was the game that I was just like, all right, he's just going on one of [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=468.64s)]
*  the TVs for the rest of the year when he's playing, I'm just, that's it. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=471.48s)]
*  I just want to experience it live versus on social. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=474.68s)]
*  Uh, a cousin of this award, which I had a million years ago, the Julius [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=478.44s)]
*  Irving award I had for the most exciting player of the year. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=483.59999999999997s)]
*  And I wrote that we'll call this one the doc with the trophy looking like [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=486.40000000000003s)]
*  his Tomahawk slam against the Lakers in 1983. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=490.0s)]
*  Don't you wish we'd had this award the past four decades? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=493.56s)]
*  I could totally see check in the list and getting retroactively riled up [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=496.2s)]
*  that Dominique only won one doc award. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=499.72s)]
*  I like the idea of a doc award. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=502.36s)]
*  Who, and you know, Dr. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=504.68s)]
*  J doc, um, who would you give that? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=506.36s)]
*  Would that be not doc rivers? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=509.44s)]
*  No, not doc rivers. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=510.84000000000003s)]
*  Would you give it to ant? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=511.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=513.4s)]
*  For the Utah duck. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=513.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=514.76s)]
*  I didn't even know what's even close. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=515.0s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=517.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=518.48s)]
*  Next award. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=518.68s)]
*  This is the 1986 bill Walton award for biggest impact under 20 minutes of game. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=520.4s)]
*  Bill Walton has played 18 minutes a game on the 86 Celtics. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=526.6s)]
*  Just crushing it. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=530.48s)]
*  Our nominees, Andre Drummond leading the league in rebounds per 36 minutes, 19 a [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=531.48s)]
*  game, TJ McConnell, 10 point in assists per 36 this year, second in the league. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=537.68s)]
*  Your guys Sam Merrill 4.8 threes per 36 second. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=545.04s)]
*  And then, uh, microwave bill Russell himself, Jonathan Isaac, who just comes [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=551.56s)]
*  in for two, seven minutes stretches each game and can guard anyone in the league [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=557.04s)]
*  as well as they can be guarded. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=561.52s)]
*  Um, I am voting for Jonathan Isaac who we've discussed many times, but I think [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=563.44s)]
*  he's a runaway winner of this award. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=567.68s)]
*  Who do you have? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=569.28s)]
*  Well, I didn't get the nominees just so the audience understands ahead of time. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=571.56s)]
*  Because I wrote all this stuff down this morning. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=575.0s)]
*  And who else did you have? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=577.56s)]
*  Well, believe it or not. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=579.4s)]
*  And you're going to think I did it because of today's game, but it's not. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=580.48s)]
*  It's Dante Exum. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=583.04s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=584.32s)]
*  Comes in right underneath the qualifier, 19.7 minutes a game. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=585.96s)]
*  And we're not just talking about, Hey, he's been good in his role. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=589.6s)]
*  He was out of the league for basically three years. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=593.48s)]
*  Where was he on partisan? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=597.12s)]
*  It was someone that was here. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=599.44s)]
*  You're a big teams. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=600.44s)]
*  You see, you know, here's the thing. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=602.88s)]
*  It's like the last few years he was in the NBA. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=604.88s)]
*  He wasn't really doing anything either. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=607.52s)]
*  So you could make an argument that Exum was like off the NBA radar, like, Oh, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=608.92s)]
*  he's still in the league for six years. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=612.68s)]
*  And the other three years he wasn't even in it. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=614.92s)]
*  And so he comes in, he plays a really crucial role. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=616.68s)]
*  He missed basically most of January, February. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=620.52s)]
*  So you were kind of like, Oh, that was kind of a fun Exum story. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=622.68s)]
*  Then he shoots 59% from three in the month of March. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=625.36s)]
*  He had the shoot huge shot against Sacramento. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=628.0s)]
*  He had the huge three today. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=630.28s)]
*  And he didn't just have the history today. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=632.16s)]
*  He was, you know, they're trapping people and he's just making these. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=634.56s)]
*  Really smart, like drive decisions where he's either going to the [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=639.28s)]
*  basket or kicking it back out. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=642.3199999999999s)]
*  It was like, I thought pretty high level. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=643.76s)]
*  I was kind of shocked. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=645.3599999999999s)]
*  I he's never shot the ball. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=649.0799999999999s)]
*  He's never like, that was the thing. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=651.0799999999999s)]
*  Even when we all loved him as a prospect. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=652.3599999999999s)]
*  Cause you go, okay, if this guy ever figures it out, but even if he doesn't [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=654.0s)]
*  shoot, he's so athletic, he's big. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=656.52s)]
*  He can defend, he can drive. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=658.16s)]
*  Like I remember guys talking about him. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=659.8s)]
*  I think it was the hoop summit. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=661.1199999999999s)]
*  They're like, this guy's serious. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=662.2399999999999s)]
*  And then he's immediately hurt. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=664.16s)]
*  And you know, he played a decent amount, I think the first two years, but then [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=666.3199999999999s)]
*  if you go through his, his baseball card, you're like, man, he wasn't like, okay. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=670.92s)]
*  He played in the NBA that year, but he played like 20 games. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=674.88s)]
*  And then that year, I think he started four games. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=677.52s)]
*  So basically out of the league for three and then comes back and plays a major [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=679.12s)]
*  role for a team trying to contend in the West. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=682.6s)]
*  Who's your pick? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=685.1999999999999s)]
*  That's a really good pick. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=687.56s)]
*  It's Isaac. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=688.92s)]
*  So I'm picking Isaac, but I think what Exum is doing in a way is more [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=689.84s)]
*  interesting for the playoffs because. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=695.8800000000001s)]
*  And now if you look at his stats, he's averaging like five points [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=698.44s)]
*  a game in the last two months. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=700.9200000000001s)]
*  So it's not like he's been amazing, but, um, I love the Isaac pick. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=701.8800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=706.12s)]
*  Well, that, but with Exum, they've been able to play roulette with those wings [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=706.44s)]
*  and every game kind of somebody plays well. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=709.8000000000001s)]
*  And I don't know how sustainable that is for a playoff series, but [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=713.08s)]
*  they've been doing it for a while. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=716.0s)]
*  At least with Exum, he can defend, you know, if he's not helping them [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=717.92s)]
*  offensively, he can always guard people, but it's an amazing story. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=720.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=724.16s)]
*  And off of the traps for Luca, and then you're worried about Kyrie. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=724.44s)]
*  So you can try to get real trap heavy and teams are going to try something [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=727.92s)]
*  with Luca at different moments in a playoff series, there's like, let's [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=732.08s)]
*  just force the ball out of his hands and hope we have enough size to stay in [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=734.5600000000001s)]
*  front of Kyrie, good luck, but then the rest of those guys, it should be easy. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=736.92s)]
*  Living for Dante. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=741.32s)]
*  I mean, a lot of these shots are wide open, but even PJ in the corner, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=742.96s)]
*  like if PJ is just some kind of threat in the corner. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=745.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=748.5999999999999s)]
*  They were leaving him alone in the game today, but he made him. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=748.7199999999999s)]
*  Cause you kind of, well, you had to with the lack of size, cause they went small. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=751.24s)]
*  They had the foul trouble again, the vertical. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=754.3599999999999s)]
*  Dante has been around for so long that when we were at Grantland, Danny Chow [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=757.16s)]
*  kind of adopted him and I think wrote a big piece, maybe that draft and was [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=762.4s)]
*  kind of like the, I mean, there was, when there was, when I said nobody was on [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=768.24s)]
*  Dante, XM Island, it was him by himself. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=772.0s)]
*  It was like the guy who's living in the lighthouse at like the end of Maine. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=775.76s)]
*  And there's like nobody else in the town in Maine, but, but them, and he's [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=778.84s)]
*  just hitting the light every day. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=781.84s)]
*  So I'm happy for Danny. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=783.2s)]
*  The Vinny Del Nigger award for worst coach of the year. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=785.6s)]
*  The nominees are Monte Williams, who we've discussed multiple times in this pod. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=790.0400000000001s)]
*  Greg Popovich. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=794.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm just throwing in there because the, the thinking you didn't need a point [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=795.6s)]
*  card with one B continues to infuriate me West on cell junior. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=799.4s)]
*  And, uh, my pick is Adrian Griffin. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=802.96s)]
*  I don't know if he had any more nominees. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=805.6s)]
*  I have money. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=809.04s)]
*  I didn't need any others. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=810.16s)]
*  I don't know what he did. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=812.88s)]
*  I don't know what he did to prep to coach his team this year, but like when he had [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=813.84s)]
*  that moment a few months ago, it was like, is Jayden Ivey really locked? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=818.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=823.52s)]
*  Cause I was watching so many of their games at the beginning of the year. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=823.8000000000001s)]
*  Cause I wanted to see if Kate would respond. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=825.96s)]
*  And I think that part of it's good. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=827.76s)]
*  We've already covered, like they just shouldn't have the record that these other [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=829.5600000000001s)]
*  awful teams have, even though they're young, they're more talented than some [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=832.96s)]
*  of these other teams, like Charlotte's talented guys don't even play. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=837.52s)]
*  So there's that part of it. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=840.8000000000001s)]
*  Washington has no one on the roster. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=841.84s)]
*  You're really excited about, unless I can offer you in some heady, Danny [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=843.5600000000001s)]
*  Aviya play or some kisspert makes, um, like both of them, maybe the, the big [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=847.2s)]
*  Euro who Draymond will probably punch next year, um, he's, he's been all right. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=853.36s)]
*  So, uh, look, I just, I couldn't believe, I know they weren't going to be good, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=859.6s)]
*  but I, I couldn't believe some of the closing rotations that he had with that [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=866.8000000000001s)]
*  team. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=870.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=871.4s)]
*  And you look at what Taylor Jenkins had to work with in Memphis and that team [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=871.64s)]
*  has had some nice wins and has developed young guys and seems organizationally [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=875.36s)]
*  to at least be like moving forward. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=881.16s)]
*  You would not say the same about Detroit. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=882.6s)]
*  One more award before we go to a break. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=884.76s)]
*  The Freeman Williams award for biggest black hole. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=887.08s)]
*  Freeman Williams has one of my favorite basketball reference pages on the [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=890.52s)]
*  1980, 81 Clippers. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=894.48s)]
*  He played 24.1 minutes a game. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=897.28s)]
*  He averaged 19.3 points a game and took 16.8 field goals, 16.8 field [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=900.36s)]
*  goals and 24.1 minutes, which if you do the per 36 projects to like 25 shots a [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=906.76s)]
*  game and he was like the seventh man on the Clippers. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=914.48s)]
*  So I was debating whether to, to name it after him or John Drew, but his, he was [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=917.6800000000001s)]
*  just, uh, way more black hole. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=921.84s)]
*  Super John Williamson could have been a good one too. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=924.44s)]
*  This, I mean, this is camp Thomas's award to lose. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=927.08s)]
*  I don't even know who, who else I would throw in there. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=931.52s)]
*  Like you look at Colin Sexton and the field goal attempts per minute are pretty [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=934.08s)]
*  high, but at least he passes a little bit to me. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=937.72s)]
*  This is a camp Thomas's award to lose. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=940.12s)]
*  You have any other nominees? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=942.28s)]
*  Camp Thomas was my first thought, but to be fair to camp Thomas, he's jumped [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=944.0s)]
*  dramatically in his assist ratio. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=948.2s)]
*  So if you go per 100 possessions, he was, whenever you're in the single digits, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=949.96s)]
*  it's like really scary where you almost feel like you want to bring the guy to [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=953.92s)]
*  like counseling and go, you know, you can actually pass this thing once you have it. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=958.04s)]
*  Um, but it's jumped up to like 16% and the assist numbers, like it's at least. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=961.64s)]
*  I don't always love some of the cam Thomas games. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=967.2s)]
*  And I think there's a bigger nets discussion where you go, how is this team [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=969.8s)]
*  almost like, you know, I would say average at best and then falls off a cliff. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=973.68s)]
*  Like, is it because of Spencer Dinwiddie? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=980.76s)]
*  That doesn't seem to make any sense. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=983.8s)]
*  So I don't think cam should win it. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=985.8s)]
*  I started looking at what did you have for Williamson on his shot attempts [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=988.56s)]
*  per 36 that year, do you still have it? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=994.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=998.04s)]
*  It wasn't as good as Freeman. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=999.08s)]
*  He had a couple of good ones though. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1001.0400000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1002.9200000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1003.36s)]
*  So, cause Brandon Boston is not afraid. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1003.6800000000001s)]
*  Oh, his, he takes for his career. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1007.44s)]
*  He's 22 shots per 100 possessions. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1011.5600000000001s)]
*  So it's like every fifth time he's coming down. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1015.2800000000001s)]
*  And if you remember too, it was, oh, you know, he, he didn't shoot it well in [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1018.2s)]
*  college because his hand was hurt. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1023.76s)]
*  And he hit, remember he had those stretches where he just went off for a little while. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1025.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1028.72s)]
*  I was like, man, this guy's like really, really talented. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1028.96s)]
*  I went to one of the, one of the games of the Quippers when he came off the bench [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1030.76s)]
*  and I think he had like 30 and it was like, oh my God, it's like, he's like a [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1034.1200000000001s)]
*  lottery pick, they stole him and then he was never seen again. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1037.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1040.96s)]
*  He's under 40%. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1041.2s)]
*  It was just under 40% from his career for the floor. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1042.16s)]
*  I'm going to give it to Michael Porter Jr. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1044.2s)]
*  His assist ratio is 6.3% for his career, 6.7 for this season. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1046.16s)]
*  He's a heck of a player, but I think even the most hardcore [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1052.52s)]
*  nuggets fan would tell you like, I don't know if that level is, if it's ever [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1057.2s)]
*  going to get there, cause I think you could even argue, you saw it with [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1063.1200000000001s)]
*  Jaylen Brown and Tatum for a really long time, where it's like, you guys are [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1065.5600000000002s)]
*  great individually, but at some point to be on a good team, they have to understand [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1068.92s)]
*  that there's still maybe another option other than you taking the shot. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1074.52s)]
*  And I think that would be like the next ceiling of what the nuggets could be. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1078.92s)]
*  But when, like I said, when you're in the single digits with that number, it's [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1082.76s)]
*  a pretty scary, it basically, every time you watch a certain guy, you'll go like, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1085.92s)]
*  I wonder if he ever passes the ball. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1089.5600000000002s)]
*  You're like, oh my God, 5% of sister rate. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1091.16s)]
*  Like even to bad guys are like a 14%. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1093.68s)]
*  It's a great choice. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1096.3600000000001s)]
*  I just feel like the first half of the season, camp Thomas, he built such a lead. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1097.28s)]
*  It was almost became insurmountable. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1102.0s)]
*  People stopped showing up to the ballot, like to drop off a ballot. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1105.24s)]
*  They're like, Hey, the projections are no one else's. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1108.16s)]
*  You mean, yeah, you have to judge this by with the, how the guys on the other [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1110.48s)]
*  team are reacting to the guy where it's like the ball goes after half court and [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1114.72s)]
*  he gets in guys just stop moving. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1119.76s)]
*  They're like, he's going to fucking shoot. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1121.2s)]
*  I'm not even going to like pretend I'm to cut or go in the corner. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1123.0s)]
*  Like I just, I know he's launching this and I think he had the most of those. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1125.92s)]
*  Uh, I would not even allowed another name two months ago, three months ago. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1131.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, you know, it's funny. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1135.76s)]
*  Jalen green played himself out of the nominees. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1136.84s)]

*  I'm not going to give up on that yet, but it's not looking great. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1201.72s)]
*  Uh, perk saying on Wednesday night's NBA countdown that Milwaukee is the [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1204.96s)]
*  best big three in the league as Brian Winhorse kind of sat next to him, like [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1208.3600000000001s)]
*  unsure what to do and then, uh, percating the poor Zyngus trade and saying Marcus [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1213.64s)]
*  smart was the heart and soul of the Celtics. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1219.5600000000002s)]
*  That was my favorite. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1221.92s)]
*  The heart and soul of the Celtics was, was always a good one coming out of the [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1222.64s)]
*  market, a lot of, a lot of multiple people had that what other nominees do you have [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1225.44s)]
*  for this the Marcus smart stuff you've literally not heard since the season [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1229.24s)]
*  started, which is funny because a lot of people went with that. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1234.32s)]
*  I always felt like smart. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1237.24s)]
*  How you felt about smart was like a really good test for how you saw his, like [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1239.2s)]
*  people can have different opinions on players, but I never felt like, uh, oh, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1244.44s)]
*  what are they going to do? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1248.88s)]
*  They don't have Marcus smart. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1250.24s)]
*  I never felt that once. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1251.96s)]
*  And I probably didn't like him as much as other people did anyway. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1253.32s)]
*  Um, look perk is been on a run here. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1255.76s)]
*  We were first introduced to his thoughts in 2019. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1258.52s)]
*  I believe he tweeted out Trey Young's better than Steph in his first two years [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1262.7199999999998s)]
*  easily, and it's not even a debate where I would argue that they had potentially [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1266.28s)]
*  slightly different roles, uh, the first couple of years coming in when guy was [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1270.56s)]
*  allowed to do whatever he wanted. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1275.76s)]
*  Uh, I didn't understand why that would even be argued, but I think we got to go [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1277.1999999999998s)]
*  with the new man on the scene and that's Gilbert Arenas. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1282.12s)]
*  Oh, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1285.8s)]
*  who just cannot stop. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1286.62s)]
*  He called Yokech the worst MVP in the last 40 years. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1289.78s)]
*  Yeah, that was tough. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1294.74s)]
*  Um, he's basically destroyed everybody as of late. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1295.5s)]
*  He said that the NBA basically wanted euros in to promote the game, but now [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1301.62s)]
*  the game is soft, even though if you look at the top five players in the league, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1308.4199999999998s)]
*  they're all international guys. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1313.58s)]
*  So like, I think there might be some American pride in that where it's, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1315.74s)]
*  Hey, what's going on? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1320.46s)]
*  Uh, I don't know where I, and you know, like, look, once he becomes [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1322.3s)]
*  aware of Cooper flag, somebody just better tell him he was born in the [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1325.1s)]
*  States, cause then he would destroy him too. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1328.1399999999999s)]
*  Um, because he said after the Draymond hit with Nurkic, he said, quote, taking [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1330.54s)]
*  care of the euros one at a time. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1335.1799999999998s)]
*  So I didn't know if Gilbert Arenas was eligible or not. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1339.54s)]
*  Cause I can't tell if he's doing a bit. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1342.7s)]
*  Is he doing a bit? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1346.02s)]
*  Cause every time he says one of these things, it becomes a video and it goes [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1347.1799999999998s)]
*  online for a day, which seems like a win for him. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1350.7s)]
*  It is a crazy thing he can say. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1353.6599999999999s)]
*  Then the podcast is being discussed. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1357.46s)]
*  Whereas like perks, like on NBA countdown sometimes, you know, and he's saying [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1361.3s)]
*  Milwaukee is the best big three in the league and it's, I just don't know how [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1367.1s)]
*  to react to that. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1370.62s)]
*  I'm going to give it to us though, for thinking Charlotte fucked up taking [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1371.42s)]
*  Brandon Miller over scoot, cause Brandon Miller is awesome. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1375.98s)]
*  And I just think we, we should get an award at some point. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1378.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1382.42s)]
*  Miller's awesome. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1382.7800000000002s)]
*  And scoot was had a minus 58 and a minus 57 this year. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1383.8200000000002s)]
*  I'm not giving up on scoop, but we were pretty adamant that this was an [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1387.7800000000002s)]
*  apocalyptic disaster and so far we've been dead wrong. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1391.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1396.94s)]
*  But you sharpened will be a bit on this one. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1397.2600000000002s)]
*  Like I loved scoot and then you took it to a level where you were the one who said, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1398.82s)]
*  I know we both love scoot. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1402.54s)]
*  We shared custody of the love. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1404.6599999999999s)]
*  That's not what I'm fucking saying. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1406.1799999999998s)]
*  I'm not saying that I'm obviously loved scoot, but then you turned it into you're [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1407.54s)]
*  an idiot for taking, not taking scoop because of the mellow ball, which I didn't [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1413.1s)]
*  say that. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1417.8999999999999s)]
*  And that's the one that makes it look even worse. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1418.86s)]
*  Cause so, so I, so when it's in the pictures, it's like, I'm like, I'm [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1421.86s)]
*  so I, so when it's in the pictures, I'm in the montage first and then you're after [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1426.42s)]
*  me. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1431.18s)]
*  Here's what happens is I like a prospect and then you dump gasoline all over the [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1432.06s)]
*  way. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1437.34s)]
*  I'm like into the guy. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1437.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1439.3799999999999s)]
*  And then it becomes this inferno. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1439.62s)]
*  That's uncontrollable. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1441.22s)]
*  We are wrong about Brandon Miller versus scoop. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1441.9s)]
*  We are screwed this up. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1444.78s)]
*  All right. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1446.14s)]
*  All right. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1446.62s)]
*  But I'm not giving up on scoop, not out of stubbornness, but because I'm not [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1446.98s)]
*  giving up on somebody this young that was just thrown out there to play point [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1454.26s)]
*  guard, which I think he has to take his lumps. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1458.26s)]
*  And by the way, I don't know. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1459.98s)]
*  I know he got off to a bad start in the Boston game, but he's actually played [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1461.02s)]
*  better the last couple of weeks. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1465.1s)]
*  Like there's a couple of good ones signs. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1466.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1467.94s)]
*  Where I know people want us to just like, what do you, what's the goal? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1468.58s)]
*  Do you want me to say, yep, he sucks and he's going to suck forever. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1473.06s)]
*  I would never do that with a player I liked or a player I hated the first year [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1475.26s)]
*  in at this young. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1479.94s)]
*  I'm just saying we're losing the take so far. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1481.62s)]
*  Yes, absolutely agree. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1484.66s)]
*  Brandon Miller is really good. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1487.54s)]
*  Big win for KSC. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1488.58s)]

*  It's not what happened. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1546.66s)]
*  They'd scored 700 points in the all-star game and literally nobody ran back. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1547.78s)]
*  It's definitely not silver's fault though. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1553.42s)]
*  And I, I would pick the all-star one because after it, it turns into all these [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1555.6200000000001s)]

*  They're not going to fix it. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1566.26s)]

*  He said he was on that Charles Barkley, Gale King show. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1573.06s)]

*  The all-star game might be like going. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1592.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1595.42s)]

*  Remember when it was like, Oh, they're going to draft the teams. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1607.22s)]
*  That's going to be amazing. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1610.5s)]

*  Like it might be something we talk about, but then the only positive is they get [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1619.1000000000001s)]
*  all this how to fix it content. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1623.22s)]

*  being blamed for players that don't want to play in the game, it's not silver's [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1628.3s)]
*  fault. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1632.7s)]

*  You can't crimson tide this thing. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1637.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1639.46s)]

*  The McKeskey award for the best American white guy. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1643.9s)]
*  They've given this one out since, uh, I had my column in the mid two thousands [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1647.78s)]
*  are nominees. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1651.8600000000001s)]
*  Unless I miss somebody Tyler hero. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1652.8200000000002s)]
*  He's only played half the season. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1656.2600000000002s)]
*  Sam Hauser just turned into an incredible three point shooter, Walker Kessler, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1657.7800000000002s)]
*  or my pick, Chet Holmgren, who's been really good. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1664.46s)]
*  And I think he's almost a runaway winner unless you can come up with another [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1669.6200000000001s)]
*  name that you like. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1673.3000000000002s)]
*  Well, we can't nominate Isaiah Hartenstein again. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1674.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1677.74s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1678.22s)]
*  Well, we had, yeah, he did a. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1679.22s)]
*  He did a podcast. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1681.42s)]
*  He said he's biracial, so he's out, but he would have been a nominee. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1682.42s)]
*  I didn't know his dad. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1686.2600000000002s)]
*  And now I'm more familiar with his game. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1687.5400000000002s)]
*  So Chet's the pick. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1689.7s)]
*  Chet's the pick. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1691.8600000000001s)]
*  And there were some Kevin love years where it was like he's, he had the award [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1692.7800000000002s)]
*  the second day of the season. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1698.46s)]
*  This, you know, I think hero looked pretty good at the start of the year. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1700.18s)]
*  And it was like, at least could have been a debate, but he just hasn't played [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1705.3000000000002s)]
*  enough. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1708.0600000000002s)]
*  Uh, I didn't tell you we're doing this award. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1709.22s)]
*  Because it's pretty obvious who the winner is, but the Dennis Rodman award [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1711.38s)]
*  for the biggest ongoing distraction of the season, um, Draymond Green. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1714.5s)]
*  I don't see how anybody else would be in contention for that one. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1721.3400000000001s)]
*  And it's, it's not quiet with him. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1725.8200000000002s)]
*  It's, it's not quiet with Draymond for 10 straight days. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1728.98s)]
*  Nope. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1734.74s)]
*  It's just not. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1737.0600000000002s)]
*  Be like, man, the words are doing good. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1737.66s)]
*  They won six and around. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1739.22s)]
*  Oh, here comes something. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1740.1000000000001s)]
*  The, I did this one for you, the Jim Coughlin award for you. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1743.98s)]
*  Think you better than me. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1749.9s)]
*  Which I think we have to hand the JJ LeBron podcast. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1755.0600000000002s)]
*  I'm glad they're doing it, but they're the first 15 minutes of the pod when they [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1758.18s)]
*  were lecturing everybody that the basketball discourse is so big. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1761.8200000000002s)]
*  So they're here to save the day. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1765.26s)]
*  I was personally offended. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1766.46s)]
*  It's like, Hey man, we're, we're trying. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1768.82s)]
*  We're trying to have basketball conversations. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1770.46s)]
*  What was that day like for you? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1772.58s)]

*  Congrats. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1778.06s)]
*  There's, there's a lot of, a lot of people trying to have smart [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1779.02s)]
*  conversations about basketball. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1781.58s)]
*  We've been trying to do that for the last 15, 20 years on podcasts. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1782.94s)]
*  So I was going to, I was going to go to like Grant Williams was, was a potential [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1788.42s)]
*  winner of a bunch of these for me, but I think Grant Williams is a very good, like [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1791.94s)]
*  if you think about the core of gems beliefs, like what you think it's me, you think it's me. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1796.3400000000001s)]
*  Oh, that's interesting. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1804.42s)]
*  So, so you twisted it a different way. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1805.38s)]
*  I like this. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1807.5400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1808.98s)]
*  Wait, you think it's, you think like, Hey man, last Friday we went out, like two [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1810.26s)]
*  guys get arrested and the guy got his eye socket broken and gems like, oh, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1815.38s)]
*  that's a good one. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1819.5s)]
*  Next award is the Andre Blatch Jordan pool award. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1821.9s)]
*  I couldn't, I couldn't name it on, I was going to name it the Andre Blatch award, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1825.18s)]
*  but I just think that's disrespectful to Jordan pool for most immediately [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1828.98s)]
*  regrettable extension. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1832.7s)]
*  There's two types of extension. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1834.3s)]
*  One is the extension you gave and like two years later, you're like, Ooh, man, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1835.54s)]
*  wish we hadn't done that. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1841.74s)]
*  I mean, I think it's, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1842.66s)]
*  Ooh, man, wish we hadn't done that. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1846.58s)]
*  Then there's like the Andre Blatch, which this will never be topped. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1849.54s)]
*  They gave him the extension and the amnesty clause was kicking in the next [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1852.94s)]
*  year when the extension was kicking in and they use the amnesty to on the [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1857.7s)]
*  extension, which will never happen again. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1861.66s)]
*  It's it remained all kinds of history. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1863.6200000000001s)]
*  Um, this year's nominees, Zach Collins, who got the two years for 34 add to his [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1866.18s)]

*  I know they had, well, they, the team that won this had to do it too. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1888.5800000000002s)]

*  I'm in that AO keeper auction, the league of dorks and somebody spent [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1912.8200000000002s)]
*  $26 on Shane Bieber and he blew out his elbow three days later. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1916.42s)]
*  Like pitchers, there's no sport like baseball where you just, you know, I [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1920.3400000000001s)]

*  This just happened. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1927.5400000000002s)]
*  50% of the starters. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1928.46s)]
*  They're going to run out of pitchers. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1931.0200000000002s)]
*  There's going to be guys pitching. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1932.66s)]
*  Like you think Toronto's rosters get weird certain nights, right? [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1933.8200000000002s)]
*  There's going to be guys pitching in a game. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1937.0600000000002s)]
*  You're like, who is this guy? [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1938.38s)]
*  And they'd be like, Oh, Disney's already making a movie about him. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1940.3000000000002s)]
*  Like, he's going to be the second one. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1942.46s)]
*  That's the whole series. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1943.5400000000002s)]
*  Jordan pool still has three years, 96 million left. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1945.66s)]
*  His wind share is actually his wind shares per 48 is negative. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1948.18s)]
*  You don't see that very often. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1951.38s)]
*  It's hard to be below zero and he's below zero. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1952.5800000000002s)]
*  And I have no idea what happened. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1955.78s)]
*  You're saying he's going back to back two straight years. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1957.5s)]
*  He wins this award. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1960.5s)]
*  Cause there's not that many bad contracts. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1961.3s)]
*  They're just aren't like for this award. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1963.1s)]
*  I went through and kind of, you know, did all the stuff that we normally do. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1965.1399999999999s)]
*  You try to stay on top of it and you're looking through it and you go, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1968.26s)]
*  there's just not that many bad ones. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1971.18s)]
*  Now I do think that this off season could have the first run of contracts where [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1972.46s)]
*  you go, what the hell was going on there? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1977.02s)]
*  Because it's a lot of teams that have a lot of cap space that aren't very good. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1979.86s)]
*  And whether it's LeBron getting his number, which I would still [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1984.18s)]
*  imagine is with the Lakers. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1987.74s)]
*  I don't know what you do with Harden's number. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1989.06s)]
*  If you're the Clippers, like that feels like it could fluctuate series to series. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1990.86s)]
*  If they have an early exit on all of this, they've already extended [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1994.86s)]
*  Kawhi where it's 150 million for him. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=1998.1399999999999s)]
*  Years 33, 34 and 35 seasons. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2000.42s)]
*  OG and an OB as good as he is. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2003.82s)]
*  And he's, he's good. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2006.46s)]
*  I don't think he's like amazing. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2007.7s)]
*  It's pretty good. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2009.78s)]
*  He doesn't play enough. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2010.34s)]
*  And then Tobias, like you just know Tobias Harris has a hundred million [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2012.66s)]
*  rent on him for some teams. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2016.1399999999999s)]
*  And he's just like, all right, I'll just, I'll take their money. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2017.5s)]
*  Like if I say over under 90 million for Tobias Harris this summer, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2020.7s)]
*  what do you think it is? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2024.3s)]
*  I think it's under, I think it's under the way he played without indeed. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2025.22s)]
*  I think he's looking at like a Bruce Brown type of two for 50 type of thing. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2030.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2035.02s)]
*  The option. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2035.26s)]
*  I think, I think the van Vliet Bruce Brown type contracts are going to be [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2035.98s)]
*  where we go with the teams that use these cap space where it's like, well, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2039.58s)]
*  overpriced, overpriced, overpriced, overpriced, overpriced, overpriced. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2042.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2046.5s)]
*  I think that's the, that's the point of the, of the, of the, of the, of the, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2046.62s)]
*  of the cap space where it's like, we'll overpay you a little, let us use our cap [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2051.66s)]
*  space and you know, you'll make more in two years than you would in three, but [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2056.1s)]
*  this helps us. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2062.9s)]
*  I'd feel like that's how it goes. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2063.82s)]
*  Do you agree though? [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2065.54s)]
*  There's, there's not, this is not the same. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2066.5s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2068.5s)]
*  You guys did the worst punch up horse contract podcast recently. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2069.1s)]
*  There's just not, it used to be hilarious. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2072.78s)]
*  I think the end and OB contracts terrifying. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2075.18s)]
*  I have a lot of Nick's fans, friends of my life, and none of them feel great [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2077.2599999999998s)]
*  about paying him five years, 200 million or whatever it is when the guy can't [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2080.1s)]
*  seemingly stay in the court because those are the contracts you can't escape. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2085.1s)]
*  But I mean, we thought Kyrie three for one 20 seemed crazy last year and that [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2090.3799999999997s)]
*  one worked out. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2094.5s)]
*  So, you know, it's a 30 team league. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2095.22s)]
*  You got to pay three guys. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2099.3399999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2102.7s)]
*  Without high the salary cap is you have to pay 130 million dollars for a year [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2103.1s)]
*  for three guys, basically to be, have a good team. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2108.8199999999997s)]
*  So there's going to be mistakes. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2111.02s)]
*  The Ewing theory award for the star most likely to be Ewing theory, hypothetical, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2114.14s)]
*  which means the person gets hurt in the team for whatever reason starts playing [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2124.8199999999997s)]
*  better when he's not there. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2131.5s)]
*  And by the way, this might not happen and we might not even happen until next year, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2133.7799999999997s)]
*  but our nominees are Julius Randall, Carl Anthony towns, Donovan Mitchell, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2138.02s)]
*  Kawhi Leonard. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2147.5s)]
*  Anybody else you have for this? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2151.02s)]
*  Nope. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2153.2599999999998s)]
*  What's your answer? [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2154.9s)]
*  It's not Kawhi. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2156.14s)]
*  It's not Mitchell. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2156.7799999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2158.38s)]
*  There's just no way that the Clippers are actually better. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2160.02s)]
*  Without Kawhi. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2164.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2165.7799999999997s)]
*  And Kawhi is technically not eligible because he already won the title. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2165.98s)]
*  I'm shocked that this would even be, he would be nominated for this. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2169.22s)]
*  Listen, I'm just reading the nominations. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2173.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't, this is what the committee came up with. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2175.06s)]
*  The problem is there's no perfect, there's no Patrick Ewing for the [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2177.9s)]
*  Ewing theory this year. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2183.74s)]
*  I mean, it's, there's a reason why it's named after him. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2185.3399999999997s)]
*  Towns is probably the closest cause towns is making 60 million a year. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2187.74s)]
*  And it would be funny if he had some sort of setback and they just [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2192.1s)]
*  kept winning without him. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2195.54s)]
*  I think he fits the premise the best. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2196.5s)]
*  The Lou Brown award for the out of nowhere team that surprised you the [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2201.7s)]
*  most are nominees are Indiana Orlando and OKC. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2205.7400000000002s)]
*  What was the biggest surprise for you out of those three? [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2210.02s)]
*  I liked Orlando a lot, you know, based on like the way I like the [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2214.18s)]
*  talent of Detroit's roster. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2218.26s)]
*  But again, I didn't think Orlando was going to go 13 at 65. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2220.14s)]
*  Cause if you watched them last year, you were like, wait, this team's [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2223.02s)]
*  kind of in some of this stuff. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2226.98s)]
*  You know, they, they felt like, like, you know, you better show up when [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2228.66s)]
*  you're playing the magic or whatever reason, this is a tough team. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2232.66s)]
*  If the magic ended up with a three seed and part of that's the way Miami [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2236.42s)]
*  treats the regular season, the Embiid injury, you know, Atlanta constantly [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2239.86s)]
*  be disappointing, Chicago just being kind of meh, like to be the three or [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2243.34s)]
*  the two seed. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2247.1s)]
*  I think it's them. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2248.94s)]
*  Cause I, I always thought that the line that we have 10, one through 10 in [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2249.7s)]
*  the West and then 11 through 15 is basically what you thought, especially [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2253.7s)]
*  with Memphis's injuries. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2257.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2260.38s)]
*  The instinct would be, well, why isn't OKC? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2260.62s)]
*  They have a chance to get the one seed, but a lot of people were on OKC [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2262.94s)]
*  before the year, including me. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2266.3399999999997s)]
*  I was, that was probably the thing I was the most passionate about. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2267.5s)]
*  I remember when we did, so these are all three teams that we all went over [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2270.06s)]
*  when we did the over under pod with house, which we did really well on. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2273.18s)]
*  And we all loved Indiana to go over. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2276.7000000000003s)]
*  I think there over was like 38 and we got to Orlando and we talked it out. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2278.5s)]
*  We were like, I kind of like it, but not really in the over. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2283.6600000000003s)]
*  It was like 37. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2286.38s)]
*  And then we kind of all collected. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2287.6600000000003s)]
*  We were like, that's Saruti's here. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2288.9s)]
*  Let's, let's do it for Saruti. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2290.5s)]
*  And we did, we took the over cause it was like, ah, it'd be fun. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2292.02s)]
*  I don't think any of us were thinking three seed, not any point of that [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2295.38s)]
*  combo, so I think they have to be the winner. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2299.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2301.94s)]
*  It's not like I thought they'd suck, but they're still in play for the two seed [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2302.1s)]
*  and they're most likely going to be the three seed. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2306.3399999999997s)]
*  So I just think it's a really nice leap where if they didn't have, they were [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2308.9s)]
*  in the play and they get bounced. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2313.66s)]
*  They're not really in the playoffs. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2314.94s)]
*  You go, okay, you know, 24, 25, this is the year. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2316.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2319.7s)]
*  And it's nice. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2319.94s)]
*  It's nice that whatever, and they certainly have their problems offensively [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2321.02s)]
*  late and that kind of stuff, but they didn't have another linger year where [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2324.74s)]
*  they don't do anything and you're going, man, I like some of the guys, but are [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2328.42s)]
*  they ever going to put this together? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2331.7s)]
*  And I think based on who they are, this is a really impressive season. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2333.2599999999998s)]
*  What's weird to me is I don't feel like Franz has played that well. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2338.3799999999997s)]
*  He has it because he has it. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2342.7799999999997s)]
*  His shooting numbers are bad. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2344.1s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2346.22s)]
*  He like teams are playing off him now. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2346.8199999999997s)]
*  Lee, I think it's one of the problems they have laying games is teams are [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2349.2599999999998s)]
*  treating them not like full Draymond, but I think teams are like fine if he [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2352.02s)]
*  wants to shoot a 24 footer. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2356.4199999999996s)]
*  And I always felt like that was going to become this key part of his game. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2357.8999999999996s)]
*  And he kind of went backwards on it. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2361.58s)]
*  So the fact that they're going to be a potential two or three seed without [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2362.86s)]
*  him really taking a leap, I thought was really surprising. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2366.58s)]
*  Um, the Zaza peculiar were peculiar, peculiar, peculiar, peculiar, peculiar, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2369.7799999999997s)]
*  peculiar, got it. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2378.38s)]
*  The Zaza peculiar word for the rule that absolutely needs to be changed. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2382.38s)]
*  Our nominees, the 65 game rule for awards, positionless ballots, or [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2389.4199999999996s)]
*  being able to review a block charge. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2398.7799999999997s)]
*  And I know you probably have more nominees, but my winner and one of my [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2402.22s)]
*  passions now in life is for us not to review block charges anymore. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2406.18s)]
*  Take them out of the game. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2410.46s)]
*  Just let the ref call it and let's move on. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2411.8199999999997s)]
*  Please for the love of God. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2414.4199999999996s)]
*  Of the nominees, I would go with that. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2419.22s)]
*  No one cares about our ballots and the 65 game thing. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2420.66s)]
*  I think the NBA had to do something to make their partners and television [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2424.3399999999997s)]
*  feel better about it. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2427.18s)]
*  And for the most part, it's going to work out. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2428.06s)]
*  Like we had some really lean years there. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2429.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2431.7799999999997s)]
*  If you looked at some of the top scoring players, you're like, Hey, these guys [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2431.9399999999996s)]
*  are missing a huge trunk of the season collectively. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2434.2999999999997s)]
*  So they've corrected that. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2437.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2439.06s)]
*  And you knew no matter what, like if the principal announces some rule change [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2439.8599999999997s)]
*  and everybody decides they don't like it. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2443.1s)]
*  So then it becomes a players association ownership league thing where it's like, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2444.58s)]
*  how come they come up with 65? [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2447.82s)]
*  Like Halliburton came back early and played when he was hurt because he was [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2449.5800000000004s)]
*  worried about the extension and the bonus and all that kind of stuff. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2452.6600000000003s)]
*  And you're like, all right, well, that's, that sucks for him. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2454.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2457.6600000000003s)]
*  But I think in the general sense, it was something that the players [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2458.5s)]
*  have clearly responded to. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2465.54s)]
*  Um, and if you look at the history of the guys making all NBA and the MVP, it's [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2467.46s)]
*  not like it was this absurd number that hasn't been reached before it just was, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2473.3s)]
*  oh, they get people in charge made this announcement. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2477.3s)]
*  So now we're going to push back from the whole thing. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2479.1000000000004s)]
*  So, uh, I'm with the on the block charge thing, but I am so happy about the [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2480.38s)]
*  officiating since the midway point. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2484.3s)]
*  And if you look at the best players, it's not like they're all scoring 18 a game [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2488.26s)]
*  now because the game is more physical. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2491.6600000000003s)]
*  There's less tricking, which was my entire point. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2493.54s)]
*  So, um, it's never going to be perfect, but I just think it's so much better now, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2497.02s)]
*  even if there's going to be times where a guy ends up in the stanchion and [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2501.98s)]
*  didn't get a call. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2505.78s)]
*  So, because I'd rather be this way than what we had in the beginning of the year. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2507.6600000000003s)]
*  We need to get through one more week where there's not a giant fight. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2511.46s)]
*  Cause the only thing that could ruin this is a giant fight. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2514.7400000000002s)]
*  And there's been some games that share words it's edge that way, but it didn't [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2517.42s)]
*  happen. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2521.38s)]
*  That would be my fears. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2522.38s)]
*  The games are so physical now that I just think I'm not like our test [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2523.38s)]
*  melee level, but we haven't had a full like guys just throwing haymakers at each [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2528.82s)]
*  other. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2532.78s)]
*  And it's, it's in, it's, it's kind of inching toward that because some of the [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2533.02s)]
*  shit is just super physical, super about it's been amazing. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2539.58s)]
*  Uh, for some of the players who love to play that way, but if you're like staff, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2543.42s)]
*  not awesome, like, cool. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2548.06s)]
*  I'm just getting crushed. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2550.86s)]
*  Look at the best players. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2552.9s)]
*  And there's a couple of people on the free throw rate stuff. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2554.42s)]
*  We're like, I looked at it with Brunson where you're like, okay, that's dropped [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2556.5s)]
*  off. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2559.42s)]
*  Damien Lillard was between seven to nine free throw attempts per game. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2559.74s)]
*  And it looks like the last couple months he's in the four range. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2563.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2566.4199999999996s)]
*  So you're like, Whoa. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2566.8999999999996s)]
*  And I, you know, I don't know that that's the main reason Milwaukee's struggled [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2568.18s)]
*  again here. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2572.14s)]
*  I think they're still trying to find themselves and granted we already covered [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2572.62s)]
*  the guys in the play during that awful three game stretch there. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2575.54s)]
*  But if you look at the overall scores, it's, it's, they're still such great [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2578.06s)]
*  players. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2582.62s)]
*  They're still going to find a way to score, but what you're seeing less of is [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2583.8599999999997s)]
*  let me use this possession to try to trick the officials into something, which [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2587.94s)]
*  is a win for all of us. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2591.98s)]
*  We're going to take a break. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2595.7000000000003s)]
*  And then one of my favorite awards is coming up next. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2597.26s)]
*  All right. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2601.1s)]
*  We're on a good pace. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2601.34s)]
*  Coming back. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2604.14s)]
*  Set three breaks, Kyle. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2606.98s)]
*  So we can rip through this now. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2610.34s)]
*  Okay. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2613.58s)]
*  All right. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2615.6600000000003s)]
*  We're still low. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2615.86s)]
*  This is a big one. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2616.38s)]
*  This award is called the ML car trying to trade for a retired MJ award for [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2617.98s)]
*  goofiest. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2623.78s)]
*  Can you repeat that story though? [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2625.06s)]
*  Also, before I interrupt your title of the award, but I need, I need to hear [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2627.14s)]
*  this again too, so just keep going. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2630.98s)]
*  And, but tell us the backstory of what this award is inspired by. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2632.5s)]
*  It was the year Jordan was retired. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2636.1800000000003s)]
*  ML car, I think had gotten some sort of position of power and made a big deal [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2640.46s)]
*  about how he was going to try to trade with the bulls to get the rights to [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2645.22s)]
*  Michael Jordan. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2650.02s)]
*  If he came out of baseball and this became a two day news story for some [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2651.4599999999996s)]
*  reason, I'm pretty sure the bulls, um, weren't like, yeah, you know, let's, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2654.98s)]
*  let's trade some, let's trade some ideas. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2660.8199999999997s)]
*  ML. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2663.7s)]
*  Uh, anyway, this is Kevin gamble sign. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2665.7799999999997s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2670.7799999999997s)]
*  You just signed D Brown, right? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2672.18s)]
*  Would you trade him? [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2673.74s)]
*  Um, the ML car trying to trade for a retired MJ award for goofiest, but real [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2675.06s)]
*  off season subplot because the, the, the, he really did try to trade for Jordan. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2681.22s)]
*  It wasn't a fake story. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2685.94s)]
*  Will a team draft Bronte James to go after Lebron? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2688.82s)]
*  This was the subject of a lot of texts this week. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2694.9s)]
*  Bronte did not have a good freshman season. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2697.18s)]
*  That is an understatement. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2699.66s)]
*  He was not one of the closing five guys on a USC team that I think finished [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2700.7s)]
*  under 500 and was in a bad conference and was just not a good basketball team. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2705.7799999999997s)]
*  And it's hard to fathom that he would be one of the 58 players drafted because [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2710.7799999999997s)]
*  first of all, two people forfeited their picks, so there's only 58 available. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2716.8999999999996s)]
*  And yet I do wonder, will somebody, I really do wonder if somebody in that [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2721.3799999999997s)]
*  38 to 58 range will draft him as a way to get Lebron to sign for like a free agent, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2729.58s)]
*  mid-level exception, something like that. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2737.06s)]
*  Thinking like these picks after like pick 35, it's a fucking crap shoot. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2739.42s)]
*  Anyway, let's just spend one here and maybe Lebron don't want to play with the sun. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2745.34s)]
*  Maybe we can pull them in and I think it would have to be a contender. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2749.7799999999997s)]
*  So some possible spots and this is, I read this on tankathon. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2753.1s)]
*  So these orders might switch, but the Knicks right now have the 38th pick. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2756.86s)]
*  Philly has 41, Miami is 44, the Clippers have 45, Boston has 53, Golden State, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2761.6600000000003s)]
*  54, Denver 57, and Dallas has 58. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2767.82s)]
*  I think he's going to get drafted even if he is not one of the [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2772.7400000000002s)]
*  best 58 guys in the draft. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2775.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2779.42s)]
*  The real conversation is how high can a team select him without assurances? [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2779.6600000000003s)]
*  And I still don't think he wants to leave LA. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2786.42s)]
*  I think the next chapter for Lebron is that he still would need to be in LA, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2788.98s)]
*  which is a motivation for him to come out here in the first place. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2793.66s)]
*  So that's something he's got to factor into the decision. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2796.5s)]
*  If you're telling me, Hey, would a second round team not know and say, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2802.2599999999998s)]
*  you want to just give it a shot? [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2806.38s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2807.42s)]
*  I think he could get drafted, especially with teams that have multiple second round [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2808.66s)]
*  picks going like, all right, you know what we normally do is like, we don't want a [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2812.22s)]
*  third, second round guy in here. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2814.86s)]
*  So let's trade this second for a future second with protections and maybe it [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2816.3s)]
*  expires, whatever. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2819.58s)]
*  I don't think Lebron would ever play in Boston. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2820.94s)]
*  So that would be a waste of time for them. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2823.94s)]
*  And they wouldn't have the cap space on top of everything else. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2825.26s)]
*  Well, flip it the other way. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2827.82s)]
*  Kind of a brilliant move by Boston. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2828.98s)]
*  Why? [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2832.1800000000003s)]
*  They draft Ronnie. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2833.1400000000003s)]
*  It's like, Hey, go and play with them. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2834.1400000000003s)]
*  We know you hate Boston, but you're gonna have to come. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2835.9s)]
*  You probably just call it one year for two billion. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2839.82s)]
*  He would just call his kid and be like, Hey, we're going to demand a trade after. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2842.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2845.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2846.62s)]
*  This is welcome to the league. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2846.9s)]
*  You're demanding a trade. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2848.78s)]
*  I think, uh, the second round, I think it's alive. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2849.98s)]
*  I do think it's alive in the second round because teams just got whatever. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2852.78s)]
*  So I went through, I went through the last seven years because I do think there's a [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2856.7400000000002s)]
*  cutoff point with the second round where it becomes a five to 10% chance that [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2860.78s)]
*  you're even getting a rotation player. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2865.02s)]
*  23 at these are after pick 40, Gigi Jackson 40. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2867.06s)]
*  Camaro is 52 and Jackson Davis was 57. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2871.5s)]
*  So Jackson Davis is your best case scenario for. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2874.42s)]
*  End of the second round, um, 2022 Vince Williams was 47. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2877.3s)]
*  2021 Aaron Wiggins was 55. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2882.66s)]
*  2020 there was a bunch of dudes, but that was the black swine yard. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2886.18s)]
*  I don't think anyone knew what the hell the draft was going on. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2889.34s)]
*  Trey Jones, Nick Richards, Newora, Isaiah Joe, KJ Bart and Paul Reed all after 40. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2892.1s)]
*  Uh, 2019 Horton Tucker, Fortnum and Mason. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2898.1s)]
*  46 Terrence man 48 2018 Vanderbilt 41 Bruce Brown, 42 D Anthony Melton, 46 2017 [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2901.5s)]
*  Thomas Brian, 42 Hartenstein, 43 Dylan Brooks, 45 Monte Morris, 51. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2910.7s)]
*  That's pretty good for guys who are rotation guys and maybe even a little bit better. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2915.82s)]
*  I just feel like if it's a 10% chance you're landing, somebody who might make [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2921.34s)]
*  a rotation and you're a contender, why not take him and hope that LeBron's dream [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2924.62s)]
*  would be, I just want to play with my son. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2930.98s)]
*  I won four titles. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2932.42s)]
*  I've made a kajillion dollars. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2933.38s)]
*  If I have a chance to go to a contender. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2934.9s)]
*  And I think Philly is the most interesting one out of all that seems [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2936.62s)]
*  because they have calf space too. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2939.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2940.78s)]
*  So they took Bronte like 40 or 41. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2940.98s)]
*  Then they're like, Hey LeBron, you know, come on and bead maxing. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2943.9s)]
*  Like, let's go. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2948.62s)]
*  You play with your son kind of enticing. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2949.46s)]
*  I think it's realistic. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2952.26s)]
*  Second round. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2955.38s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2955.94s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2957.06s)]
*  Because weird stuff happens in this league. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2957.9s)]
*  So despite what you think, even if you're the most anti him as an NBA prospect, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2959.62s)]
*  and he didn't really give us a ton this year to go, okay. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2963.94s)]
*  You know, like ESPN, ESPN had him as the 10th pick, the first [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2967.14s)]
*  mock before the season started, which I do think might've been motivated by like, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2970.98s)]
*  Hey LeBron, if his kid is in your lottery preview, you know, probably not going to [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2974.98s)]
*  be a terrible idea to get people to pay attention to it. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2980.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2984.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2986.02s)]
*  So, but if you start talking about picks in the forties and fifties, teams would [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2986.38s)]
*  definitely do it, but they have to be smart about, all right, is this even a 1% [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2991.82s)]
*  possibility because of it isn't then, then we're wasting it unless we really [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=2998.7400000000002s)]
*  like the players at top 50 a guy, which I don't know how many teams do. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3003.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3008.26s)]
*  And if you want to get cynical, you could say he could wink, wink to one of the [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3008.42s)]
*  teams, just trying to get his kid drafted and then an upstaying in the way. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3012.1000000000004s)]
*  Oh, and the Lakers offered me 150 million. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3015.26s)]
*  I didn't realize, but this would be good leverage for him with the Lakers because [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3017.6600000000003s)]
*  he doesn't really have a ton of leverage right now. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3020.5400000000004s)]
*  Phil, he's got, he's not going to go to a bad team. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3022.5800000000004s)]
*  He's got to go to a contender if he was going to leave LA for whatever reason. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3025.0200000000004s)]
*  So that's basically Philadelphia. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3027.98s)]
*  They have cap space. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3030.26s)]
*  It's really nobody else. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3032.82s)]
*  Nobody else who he'd want to play for has, it would have to be some sort of sign [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3033.7400000000002s)]
*  and trade if you're the Lakers, why am I doing a sign and trade and taking on your [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3036.82s)]
*  bad contract? [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3040.42s)]
*  Like, let's say he wanted to go, let's say he decided this summer only to Dallas. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3041.26s)]
*  And, and Dallas is like, cool. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3045.7000000000003s)]
*  We'll trade Tim Hardaway the last year, his deal, and you can get Dwight [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3047.42s)]
*  Powell, like whatever bad contracts they have. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3051.98s)]
*  And the Lakers be like, no, we're not doing that. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3053.78s)]
*  Fuck off. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3056.42s)]
*  If you want to sign them, you can sign them for your mid level. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3057.38s)]
*  So I do feel like this gives him a little bit of leverage, but I mean, if [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3059.98s)]
*  Bronnie wants to actually like have an MBA career, he should stay in college for a [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3065.0600000000004s)]
*  year and try to have a really good college year, right? [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3070.0200000000004s)]
*  Like this was this last college year he had was about as bad as it could have [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3072.66s)]
*  gone, starting with like he had the cardiac arrest, um, the fact that he ended [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3076.5s)]
*  up on a terrible team, the coach left right after the season, they didn't even [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3081.2999999999997s)]
*  make the, you know, I'm sure they would have gotten invited to the NIT, but, um, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3084.46s)]
*  but I, I would want to try to run that back and have a good college season [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3089.8599999999997s)]
*  before I entered the draft. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3093.94s)]
*  But if you're LeBron, you're like, I don't know if I have one year left, two [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3095.18s)]
*  years left, I want to play with my son. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3098.02s)]
*  You can talk yourself into it, right? [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3099.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3102.34s)]
*  And if a team wants to do that for him, they'll do it for him. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3102.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3105.74s)]
*  Like they will, but I would have to, like, is he going to go somewhere where [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3105.98s)]
*  it gives him a less of a chance of winning just to play with his son? [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3113.5s)]
*  Because it might be more important to him. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3117.94s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3119.22s)]
*  Yeah, maybe he's, he's won a bunch of MVPs and a bunch of titles and he is [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3120.14s)]
*  the most points of all time. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3123.74s)]
*  He's checked probably every box, everyone had check in his career, and [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3124.82s)]
*  this is the last box. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3127.62s)]
*  So my guess is that he's going to, if, if the kid ends up being in the draft, [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3128.54s)]
*  he's going to want to play with them and that will trump any other desire [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3134.06s)]
*  he has as a basketball player. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3137.18s)]
*  It'd be fucking amazing to play with your kid. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3139.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3141.98s)]
*  But I bet that he's like, okay, I'm not worried about it for 24, 25. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3142.14s)]
*  This off season, it's getting the most money I can, hopefully out of the Lakers. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3146.02s)]
*  They take care of me the way they took care of Kobe. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3149.86s)]
*  Maybe there's some sort of option thing on the third year. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3152.2599999999998s)]
*  Or second year. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3154.7s)]
*  Yeah, maybe they're going to be like, oh, I'm going to be like, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3155.38s)]
*  second year. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3157.42s)]
*  Maybe it's like a hundred million for two years, but he's got an opt out after [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3158.42s)]
*  the first year and so rig it that way. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3161.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3165.14s)]
*  And okay. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3165.38s)]
*  Maybe they have a nice little run in the West and there's a tweak here because [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3165.9s)]
*  they have more picks they can trade. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3169.66s)]
*  Like I still would think there's a big part of them who's going like, all right, [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3171.3s)]
*  I've got to make sure I'm positioned the best way I can, but then the default way [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3174.38s)]
*  of explaining it would be if those things don't work out, then he could say, [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3178.78s)]
*  well, this was always more important anyway. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3182.38s)]
*  And it's like, okay, was this more important or was this just an easier [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3184.2200000000003s)]
*  option for me to get the pick out? [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3187.06s)]
*  And then the second year, I think, I think it's a little bit more important [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3188.7s)]
*  because I think it's a little bit more important for me to get the pick out [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3191.7s)]
*  because the other options weren't put together as well. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3195.14s)]
*  I just am looking forward to it because if they are on the same team and they do [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3197.98s)]
*  play together next year, it will be the first time you've had the country [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3201.74s)]
*  just cheer on nepotism. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3204.34s)]
*  We'll see how it goes. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3212.62s)]
*  I'll tell you that Joe House was rooting for the wizards to take him with [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3213.9s)]
*  the best, best, best, best, best, best, best. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3217.1s)]
*  Next award is the Ben Simmons Award for the best Ben Simmons moment. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3219.66s)]
*  I didn't tell you we were doing this. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3224.2999999999997s)]
*  Our nominees. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3225.2999999999997s)]
*  Uh, Ben Simmons is quoted in October. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3227.66s)]
*  I think being a leader is one of those things you can lead in many different ways. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3230.34s)]
*  For me, I try to lead by example. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3233.94s)]
*  I've been blessed with the opportunity. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3236.2999999999997s)]
*  I think I've done it been a great leader so far. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3237.86s)]
*  There's one, um, Ben's agent, Bernie Lee blaming himself for Ben, not [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3239.74s)]
*  being ready to play this year. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3244.7s)]
*  He's going six for 15 free throws and zero for zero from the three point line. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3247.14s)]
*  So for the critics who say he wasn't working on his game, uh, and he's played [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3254.38s)]
*  57 games since the 2021 playoffs. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3260.54s)]
*  What is your pick for the Ben Simmons moment of the year? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3263.54s)]
*  His podcast is JJ Reddick where, you know, John Steinbeck said, if you know a [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3267.2999999999997s)]
*  man, you can't hate a man. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3273.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3275.42s)]
*  And I've thought about that quote. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3276.5800000000004s)]
*  I read a piece of his, his work the other day and I thought like, Oh, you [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3278.6600000000003s)]
*  know, there's some real truth to that. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3282.5400000000004s)]
*  Like we can watch each other on TV. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3283.78s)]
*  We can hear each other on podcasts, but they're all like detached because [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3286.3s)]
*  you don't really know the person. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3291.1800000000003s)]
*  So it's easier to actually hate that person. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3292.26s)]
*  And then it's funny once you get to know someone, even if you disagree on [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3294.5400000000004s)]
*  certain parts of the conversation that's swirling around, you're like, okay, I [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3297.6200000000003s)]
*  disagree with you, but I still like you because I know you, right? [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3301.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3304.94s)]
*  You have a window in their soul. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3306.1800000000003s)]
*  Ben Simmons explained his side of the story and I felt even worse about his [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3308.0600000000004s)]
*  prospects that doesn't happen very often. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3312.0600000000004s)]
*  The key opened up. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3315.7400000000002s)]
*  The interview was incredible. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3316.7000000000003s)]
*  JJ was great with them. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3318.1800000000003s)]
*  And then after I listened, I was like, Oh no, right. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3319.34s)]
*  This is, this is nuts. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3322.7400000000002s)]
*  Outrageable. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3324.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3325.98s)]
*  The it's everybody else's fault is always tough as a strategy. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3326.98s)]
*  Hey, the, uh, 2010 Baron Davis award for best mail-in. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3331.46s)]
*  I'll give you December Zion before he got in shape. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3336.38s)]
*  It's very good. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3340.2200000000003s)]
*  That's a very, cause I, it's hard to find the full season, but that was pretty good. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3341.1400000000003s)]
*  December Zion's in there. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3345.02s)]
*  Um, Joe angles who I really love and respect because he reminds me of myself [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3347.3s)]
*  playing pickup hoops, just running from three point line to three point line. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3351.78s)]
*  Basically, uh, you know, hanging on. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3355.02s)]
*  And then, uh, my winner is Sam Prestes trade deadline, which I think they mailed [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3358.38s)]
*  in and I still don't understand it. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3362.6200000000003s)]
*  And I still don't understand it. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3364.14s)]
*  And we've talked about it seven times and I'm not going to do it again. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3365.38s)]
*  And I know you think that made the Hayward trade to save some money down the road. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3367.74s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3370.86s)]
*  But they have a chance to make the finals and they did nothing at the trade [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3371.38s)]
*  deadline and they have 29 fucking first round picks do something. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3374.9s)]
*  I don't need to add to that. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3381.74s)]
*  Um, I'm not going to go with that. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3383.06s)]
*  That Baron Davis year is really like, it's almost insulting to how great that [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3386.14s)]
*  year is to then dominate someone for it. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3391.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3395.46s)]
*  It is. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3395.74s)]
*  Uh, Jimmy Butler for your consideration. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3396.3399999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3400.4199999999996s)]
*  Let's hear it. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3400.74s)]
*  He's really good. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3402.62s)]
*  And we know there's playoff Jimmy regular season, Jimmy, but there's some traditional [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3403.2599999999998s)]
*  stats to tell you like, no, no, he's still awesome. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3408.46s)]
*  And the shooting percentage, we look at those like, yeah, and he hits threes. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3411.06s)]
*  He doesn't take a lot. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3414.14s)]
*  So it's not like as much of a weapon. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3414.8999999999996s)]
*  It's kind of like when Mobley they're like, oh, he's starting to hit some threes. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3416.3799999999997s)]
*  And you go, okay. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3418.98s)]
*  But the other part is you have to take them 40% to mean something. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3419.42s)]
*  You're going to be taken four or five of these a game. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3424.34s)]
*  So I have watched a lot of Miami games and I still feel like he coasts way too [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3426.18s)]
*  much and I don't know that I'll ever understand him. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3434.38s)]
*  I talked about him on my pod on Thursday about the explosiveness as a score does [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3440.94s)]
*  not seem to be on the same level that it was last year. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3445.78s)]
*  I don't know whether he's playing, but we've learned to not trust anything we [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3448.18s)]
*  see from Miami in the regular season, but he just, it seems like it's harder [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3451.18s)]
*  for him to score this year. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3454.66s)]
*  And he doesn't get free throws. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3456.74s)]
*  And look, he was terrific today against the Pacers, but he took 12 free throws [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3458.34s)]
*  and hit all of them. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3461.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3461.9s)]
*  But he's, he's, he gives you the extra up fake that you're not expecting. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3462.1s)]
*  And if you're prepared for it, like if you're playing Miami in the playoffs, [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3465.14s)]
*  you were just constantly on your guys. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3468.54s)]
*  Stay on your feet with Jimmy in traffic. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3471.98s)]
*  Stay on your feet, stay on your feet, stay on your feet. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3474.46s)]
*  And just when you think he's done up faking, he's going to throw you one more. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3476.46s)]
*  And he, he lives that way offensively a lot in games because guys can help [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3480.54s)]
*  themselves. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3484.46s)]
*  I didn't have a winner for this award. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3486.2200000000003s)]
*  It's the shame bad day award for Sloan conference stat nerd, darling du jour. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3487.7s)]
*  We didn't really have one this year unless people want to talk to themselves [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3491.82s)]
*  in a Wemby, some of the Wemby stats, like Derek white. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3494.3s)]
*  What is it though? [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3498.78s)]
*  Is it, is this guy's really good because the slice Sloan, somebody does a slide [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3499.54s)]
*  that there was like a two year shame bad day run where it was like, you don't [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3505.1400000000003s)]
*  understand. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3508.1s)]
*  This is like the 21st best guy in the league because of all these weird stats [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3508.7000000000003s)]
*  that nobody understands. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3512.26s)]
*  And they were kind of right. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3513.7400000000002s)]
*  It's like, look at his on off stuff. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3515.3s)]
*  And, um, yeah, except then you could be like, Hey, I don't think Shane baddie is [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3517.02s)]
*  as good as like these other 10 guys. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3520.6600000000003s)]
*  Well, then it, then it flipped. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3522.26s)]
*  I think Sloan is dangerous. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3523.94s)]
*  It's like doing a speed ball. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3530.1s)]
*  I would probably give it to Wemby, but I didn't really come up with a good one. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3531.86s)]
*  Uh, the David Kahn award for worst GM performance, Trey Weaver, the Detroit [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3536.1800000000003s)]
*  pistons, San Antonio's year one plan for building around Wemby, which just two [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3542.1000000000004s)]
*  big giant thumbs down, uh, Brooklyn. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3548.5800000000004s)]
*  Just being in no man's land and just super confusing. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3553.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't know what their strategy is. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3557.1400000000003s)]
*  And then, uh, Jimmy Pitaro and Burke Magnus now protecting themselves against [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3558.86s)]
*  doc rivers, possibly leaving to go back to coaching. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3563.46s)]
*  Those are our four nominees. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3566.46s)]
*  I was not expecting that. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3570.78s)]
*  That's that's the transaction. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3574.38s)]
*  Maybe see that one coming. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3578.0600000000004s)]
*  He was interviewing for the Phoenix job in like mid July. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3579.2200000000003s)]
*  What about Karna Showers in Chicago? [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3583.9s)]
*  Did you know? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3587.1800000000003s)]
*  Oh, that's a good one. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3588.6200000000003s)]
*  Well, he hasn't made a trade involving players since August of 21. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3592.02s)]
*  What? [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3596.9s)]
*  Look it up. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3598.5800000000004s)]
*  There's some second round rights thing to a player that was transactional, but [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3600.42s)]
*  player traded for another player. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3605.38s)]
*  I don't believe he's made a trade since 21 of August. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3608.1000000000004s)]
*  Does he know he's allowed to make trades with players or maybe he'll [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3610.98s)]
*  find out from this podcast. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3615.22s)]
*  That's a good one. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3616.66s)]
*  Michael Porter Jr. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3617.14s)]
*  has him on the podcast and he's like, man, they told me I could start getting [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3617.8599999999997s)]
*  assists and he was like, I passed to the other guys. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3621.1s)]
*  They kept saying trade deadline. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3625.8599999999997s)]
*  I was like, I don't stock every day. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3627.4599999999996s)]
*  That's a really good nomination. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3631.7s)]
*  I'm going to back it. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3634.1s)]
*  And that's for somebody not to make a trade with involved with players [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3635.22s)]
*  in three years is historic. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3638.4599999999996s)]
*  So that's our winner. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3639.8599999999997s)]
*  The Vitali Patapiko award for worst deadline trade. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3641.1s)]
*  This goes back to the lockout season, 1999 Patino. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3645.5s)]
*  The Celtics just inexplicably traded their first round pick for Vitali Patapiko, [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3650.06s)]
*  who is a banger center. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3656.7799999999997s)]
*  Who's the equivalent of him now in 2024? [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3659.02s)]
*  Who's Patapiko? [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3662.7799999999997s)]
*  You banks? [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3667.2599999999998s)]
*  Drew you bank like a, like a little bit better Drew you banks. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3668.74s)]
*  He's better than you banks, but there's nights where you're like, [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3672.62s)]
*  okay, there's a reason why like people would want you on a team. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3675.02s)]
*  And Petin, is it Nurkic? [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3678.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's somewhere between you banks and Nurkic. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3682.1s)]
*  Petin didn't care because he knew if the trade didn't work, he was going [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3684.02s)]
*  to lead the next year anyway, ended up being, I think the eighth pick in the [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3686.34s)]
*  draft or the ninth pick eighth pick and Andre Miller and Sean Marion were on [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3689.1s)]
*  the board and Cleveland got to take Sean Marion, uh, worst deadline trades. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3693.42s)]
*  The Hayward deal, which was okay. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3697.34s)]
*  See his big movie barely plays Bogdanovich to the next. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3699.02s)]
*  Those are really the two. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3702.8599999999997s)]
*  I don't, I don't really have any nominees. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3704.14s)]
*  Uh, Bogdanovich, a trade we really like, but it just doesn't seem like Tibbs [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3705.94s)]
*  wants to play him that much, but, uh, I am going with the OKC trade for all the [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3709.3399999999997s)]
*  reasons we discussed earlier. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3713.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I'm looking it up again. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3716.46s)]
*  I think the only thing that would qualify as a trade is the Julian Phillips. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3717.8999999999996s)]
*  Oh, for the balls. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3725.1s)]
*  Oh, you're still on the balls. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3725.8999999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3727.3399999999997s)]
*  No, cause I just wanted to make sure, cause I'd read it today and now it's [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3727.74s)]
*  just so absurd. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3730.82s)]
*  I felt like I was like, you better double check this, even though I did a couple [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3731.6200000000003s)]
*  times, but that was a draft thing where they were trading around second round [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3734.02s)]
*  picks. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3739.6600000000003s)]
*  So I don't think he's trying to break a record. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3740.5800000000004s)]
*  Maybe nobody's ever done four years without a player trade. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3742.42s)]
*  I think the number is there's no player for player trade since August of 21. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3746.42s)]
*  It's a man. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3751.02s)]
*  I hate to get that wrong, but I know I've seen it a couple of different times today. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3751.3s)]
*  Uh, I don't really know that there was a bad trade because the trade deadlines [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3754.1400000000003s)]
*  suck like Bogdanovich with the health insurance, the health insurance, the [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3757.42s)]
*  healthy Knicks, everybody was freaking out about it, but at the same time, I'm [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3760.62s)]
*  like, I don't even think he closes with this team. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3763.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3765.46s)]
*  If everybody's right now they've needed them and you know, he's a nice pickup [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3765.7s)]
*  because he's, he stayed offensively impactful, uh, this late into his thirties. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3768.8199999999997s)]
*  So it was such a terrible deadline. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3773.98s)]
*  I, we already covered the okay. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3779.5s)]
*  See thing and that's still not as bad. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3780.66s)]
*  Like think about some of the trades that have happened at the deadline. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3783.1s)]
*  There's nothing even close to it this year. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3785.46s)]
*  Maybe taking on grants money. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3788.2200000000003s)]
*  So I thought about grant Williams and be like, do you really want to take out [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3790.6200000000003s)]
*  that money, but they got a 27 first out of it, so I can't, I can't get mad at [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3793.26s)]
*  Charlotte for that. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3797.0200000000004s)]
*  Just some quickie words, the LeBradford Smith award for saddest NBA feud, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3799.78s)]
*  probably Terry Easton versus the Warriors this week. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3804.34s)]
*  It's just bizarre. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3806.82s)]
*  He's in street clothes, trying to start shit with the fourth time champs. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3807.9s)]
*  Just a bizarre behavior. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3811.9s)]
*  I guarantee you, he made it in like it. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3814.0600000000004s)]
*  We all liked our Easton. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3815.7s)]
*  I was bummed when he got hurt because he was one of the many, like, I call [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3817.18s)]

*  Nothing. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3822.5s)]
*  Oh, the rockets are on. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3822.8999999999996s)]
*  I'm in and I'd love to see what he does because he just gets out there and he [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3824.06s)]
*  freaks out and it's awesome. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3828.2999999999997s)]
*  But he put on a warrior shirt and then did a video where he's like, [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3829.9399999999996s)]
*  warriors come out to play. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3834.7s)]
*  He's out for the season. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3836.4199999999996s)]
*  They lost. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3838.22s)]
*  And then he still talks shit after. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3839.66s)]
*  It's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3842.9399999999996s)]
*  it has to be a generational thing. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3845.8599999999997s)]
*  We're like, you know, your buddy comes over and you're like, what did you do [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3847.7799999999997s)]
*  today? [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3850.06s)]

*  Like, oh yeah. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3853.18s)]
*  How'd that go? [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3854.18s)]
*  Well, he responded like in 16. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3854.7s)]

*  Like awesome. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3859.2999999999997s)]

*  How's work? [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3861.9s)]
*  It's been a little slow. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3862.42s)]
*  Not the whole day, just the afternoon. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3863.5s)]
*  I think it's a generational thing where some people have just grown up with it, [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3865.22s)]
*  where you're like, no, you just fuck with everybody all the time and be like, [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3868.22s)]
*  yeah, but you're not playing and you lost. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3870.94s)]

*  But yeah, but you're not at their level and you're, you're out for the year. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3875.62s)]
*  Like at least the war, even if you hate the warriors, you go to the collective [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3879.54s)]
*  resumes, like you're going to talk shit to these guys. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3882.2999999999997s)]
*  You're going to make videos. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3884.8199999999997s)]
*  You're going to wear the shirt, you're going to do all this stuff and you're not [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3885.62s)]
*  playing. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3888.54s)]
*  And look, I don't go to TNT to confirm every thought I have about basketball, [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3888.8599999999997s)]
*  but when it's those three guys up there that played and they come back from that [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3893.18s)]
*  story and the clay quote and they're on TV and they just all are looking at each [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3896.2999999999997s)]
*  other like, what, what is this? [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3899.62s)]
*  It just looked dumb. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3902.62s)]
*  I can't imagine you may like that. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3903.82s)]
*  All right. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3906.86s)]
*  We got to go quick cause we have the big ones are left. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3906.98s)]
*  The, uh, the bank shootout and heat award for most fun shootout goes to that [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3909.78s)]
*  Indiana one 57 Atlanta one 52 game. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3913.86s)]
*  That game was awesome. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3917.26s)]
*  Back when, uh, the new rules are the, we hadn't had the old rules yet and we were [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3918.46s)]
*  just allowed to go back and forth and go nuts. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3922.5s)]
*  Uh, the team ran award for best or most polarizing NBA family member. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3925.58s)]
*  I think he, I think it's back to back unless you want to go with, uh, the [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3930.34s)]
*  NASA's because the NASA's had some run. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3935.34s)]
*  I actually liked the NASA's, but the NASA's had some runs where there were some [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3938.1000000000004s)]
*  YouTube clips and tick tocks about like mixed tapes. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3942.2200000000003s)]
*  What do you like about the NASA's? [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3946.82s)]
*  It just seems like a nice guy. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3948.98s)]
*  I like his podcast. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3952.46s)]
*  So Dominic Foxworth had him in studio on his pod. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3953.86s)]
*  When I went on, he's like, I'm going to go to the NBA. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3957.2200000000003s)]
*  He's like, yay. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3960.3s)]
*  He was here earlier today in studio. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3960.78s)]
*  I was like, you know what? [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3962.2200000000003s)]
*  I love that move. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3963.5s)]

*  He was, they were in town. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3965.98s)]
*  We reached out. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3967.1800000000003s)]
*  He said, no problem. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3967.94s)]
*  He showed up in studio and Foxworth's like, I loved him. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3968.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3971.78s)]
*  Great guy. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3972.5800000000004s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3973.98s)]
*  It's, it's, you know, he, he gets his place. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3974.46s)]
*  Um, the Reggie Lewis, I don't know. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3977.1000000000004s)]
*  I just liked this guy word for the young guy who doesn't play that much, but you [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3980.78s)]
*  still like named after Reggie Lewis that one year when Casey Jones wouldn't play [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3984.46s)]
*  him in his rookie year. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3988.2599999999998s)]
*  And every time he played, we were like, ah, I kind of like this guy. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3989.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm going to give you a bunch of names. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3992.74s)]
*  Jabari Walker, Deniavdia, Kispert, Sam Merrill, we mentioned. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=3994.5s)]
*  Kim Whitmore's had some moments. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4001.14s)]
*  Gigi Jackson, Peyton Watson probably doesn't qualify, but I'm [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4002.58s)]
*  throwing them in there anyway. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4006.1s)]
*  And Kamara I thought had some good defensive moments. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4007.3399999999997s)]
*  Uh, my, my favorite I think is Deniavdia, who I think is actually going to have a [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4010.22s)]
*  real moment on a good team at some point in his career. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4015.62s)]
*  Who is yours? [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4018.98s)]
*  Who's your pick? [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4019.66s)]
*  A lot of good picks in there. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4022.22s)]
*  Cause this is really obscure. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4023.5s)]
*  When Kam Whitmore comes to the game, it's awesome. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4025.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean, he had a drive on Luca today where he was like, I'm going to try to get you. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4027.7s)]
*  Luca stayed in front of them. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4030.98s)]
*  And then he's like, now I'm going to slam into you. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4032.14s)]
*  And Luca actually got called for a foul that he didn't commit, um, which Luca handled well. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4033.94s)]
*  But it, it's just so much fun when he gets in there and he's, he's like one of the [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4037.5s)]
*  most fearless rookies in the entire league. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4043.78s)]
*  But if I had to go off the menu, I like the Denny pick Banton for Portland. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4046.42s)]
*  Oh my dad. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4053.7400000000002s)]
*  So my dad, like four days ago, we're talking about the cell. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4054.5800000000004s)]
*  No, he's like, what's up with this Banton guy? [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4058.6200000000003s)]
*  Why did we let him go? [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4061.46s)]
*  He was, he put it, he made it a, why did we let him go? [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4062.6200000000003s)]
*  Bob Lowe bell style. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4065.1400000000003s)]
*  I mean, I was like, you used to say he looked like a chicken running around this [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4066.38s)]
*  head cut off when he played for us. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4069.5800000000004s)]
*  I don't think anyone saw this. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4071.42s)]
*  But yeah, he's been pretty good. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4073.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4075.5400000000004s)]
*  He's, he's been pretty good for him. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4075.9s)]
*  I mean, look, he played seven minutes a game for Boston. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4077.1400000000003s)]
*  It also speaks to like, there's one rotation. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4079.2200000000003s)]
*  That's a little tougher to crack. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4081.3s)]
*  You're going to be asked to be doing things. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4082.38s)]
*  They're going to be, but the freedom that he has in Portland, you kind of think [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4084.2200000000003s)]
*  about the Celtics front office and go, Hey, they weren't, they weren't wrong on this [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4088.1400000000003s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4095.1000000000004s)]

*  We don't need to debate that one. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4100.46s)]
*  Toronto is just like, we're out, man. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4101.86s)]
*  We were getting into the top six. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4103.86s)]
*  This is a thing that's going to happen. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4105.34s)]
*  This is a fun award. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4107.54s)]
*  Probably one of the most recidivism awards on the, uh, on the docket, the [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4110.099999999999s)]

*  I can't do it to Duran. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4309.26s)]
*  It's 12 boards a game in 29 minutes. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4310.26s)]

*  I just was trying to come up with names for this. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4324.18s)]
*  No, because this is a great category where early Janice was kind of like this. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4328.26s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4334.62s)]
*  Where you went, Oh my God. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4335.58s)]
*  And there's a gap. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4336.820000000001s)]
*  Did you watch like the other 20 minutes? [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4337.34s)]
*  I mean, Janice is a pull out 27 footer. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4339.54s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4342.14s)]
*  His development, uh, and what he turned himself into is, is one of the most, I [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4342.66s)]
*  think most remarkable developments of like the modern era of the NBA. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4348.22s)]
*  So what's your answer? [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4352.34s)]
*  So he got bigger, uh, probably Lamelo, but it feels a little unfair because [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4353.06s)]
*  he just isn't played enough this year. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4356.66s)]
*  Three more awards. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4361.139999999999s)]

*  Axelham and Kyrie Irving, and I think it's Kyrie. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4371.86s)]
*  It's weird to call it a comeback because the stats are pretty similar, but it [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4375.18s)]
*  feels completely different and I'm in. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4378.18s)]
*  All right. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4380.58s)]

*  Make the case. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4416.139999999999s)]
*  When a mere coffee ends up with the basketball, I'm not worried about it. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4419.42s)]
*  A mere coffee is a good basketball. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4422.54s)]
*  He made a huge three today in the, in the clipper game. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4424.219999999999s)]

*  I didn't even need that today because I, when I watched the clippers, I go. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4438.34s)]
*  All right. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4442.46s)]
*  Norm six Plumlee seven Westbrook's eight, maybe Westbrook six, whatever it is. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4443.86s)]
*  Like we're talking about coffee. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4450.22s)]
*  Maybe being the ninth guy you think about. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4451.78s)]
*  After all the other players, it's like, Well, what position is he? [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4454.14s)]
*  Is he a powerful Ford? [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4456.92s)]
*  He's a small forward. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4458.02s)]
*  What is this guy? [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4459.06s)]
*  But usually that guy sucks. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4460.34s)]
*  And I know he's not shooting three as well. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4462.74s)]
*  Um, I know last year he had a dip from it and you know, you go back to Minnesota [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4464.78s)]
*  and it was like, he put a huge numbers. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4470.259999999999s)]
*  I think he was like a legend in high school. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4471.5199999999995s)]
*  He was Mr. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4473.599999999999s)]
*  Minnesota in high school, but I find myself when the Clippers are swinging [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4474.099999999999s)]
*  the ball around and it's late in the shot clock, it's like, Oh, well, you [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4479.759999999999s)]
*  know, there's Mr. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4483.66s)]
*  Minnesota showing up. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4484.36s)]
*  Like you can put it on the floor a little bit here. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4485.3s)]
*  Um, yeah, he's at 41% after like last year, you were a little like [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4487.66s)]
*  concerned or you go, what's going on? [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4490.92s)]
*  But he's, he's consistently shot it well from three. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4492.18s)]
*  Like there's just not a lot of counting numbers. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4495.06s)]
*  You're going to be really excited about, but if you think about rotations [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4496.68s)]
*  in the NBA and how far down he is on the Clippers and that when the [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4499.5s)]
*  ball ends up in his hands, you're actually like open-minded about the [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4502.52s)]
*  outcome, he's a better basketball player, but he's got a real specific look. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4505.76s)]
*  The 2024 league pass MVP. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4512.200000000001s)]

*  Our nominees are Nicole Yokich, Victor Wembedyama, Luca [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4525.8s)]
*  Doncic and Anthony Edwards. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4530.72s)]
*  Your league pass MVP is who is it? [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4534.22s)]
*  It's for me. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4540.12s)]
*  It's Yokich for me. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4541.54s)]
*  You know, that's like picking De Niro. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4546.46s)]
*  I can't tell you you're wrong, but aunt aunt makes me feel like a kid. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4547.96s)]
*  I don't have moments where I'm at home and I'm like walking around my [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4553.9s)]
*  living room going, holy shit. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4561.46s)]
*  And as great as all these other players are, I did a whole open on this where [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4565.0s)]
*  I was kidding me like calling them basketball Viagra, where I feel like a [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4570.08s)]
*  little kid with him, you know, a couple of times a month where I'm just so [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4574.76s)]
*  excited to see him do this stuff. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4580.5s)]
*  And, you know, look, he, he or Steph are my favorite players in the league. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4583.34s)]
*  I have him third as my favorite third favorite non-Southwick. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4589.0s)]
*  Yokich won Curry too. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4593.66s)]
*  I still love Curry. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4595.780000000001s)]
*  Still love watching him. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4596.860000000001s)]
*  Uh, but aunt to move up into that territory is just that speaks to how crazy of [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4598.400000000001s)]
*  years that like you kind of, if Minnesota is playing anybody decent or better, you [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4603.34s)]
*  kind of have to throw them on a TV. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4607.94s)]
*  I, if they're playing somebody bad, I'll be like, okay, he got subbed out. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4610.66s)]
*  And then I'll, I'll try to be like, okay, normally he comes back in at this time. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4613.96s)]
*  Then I checked back in to see if he came back in. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4616.82s)]
*  It's like when you said the best shootout and I didn't know you were looking for [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4620.34s)]
*  like an ABA score on that one, but I was thinking about the Steph at the Lakers [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4623.62s)]
*  game and granted Anthony Davis only played nine minutes as I got scratched up. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4627.219999999999s)]
*  So it completely changed the game and the freedom that golden state had [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4631.320000000001s)]
*  offensively, but Curry went nuts. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4634.12s)]
*  LeBron went for like 40 in a way. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4636.28s)]
*  That game was awesome. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4638.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4639.04s)]
*  You're right. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4639.72s)]
*  That game should have won. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4640.12s)]
*  That was a Saturday night one too. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4640.88s)]
*  It was, it was like 2015 finals LeBron where he's just like, I'm going to try to [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4643.04s)]
*  do everything I can possibly do on my own. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4647.16s)]
*  It's probably one of my favorite LeBron games. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4649.38s)]
*  Um, that that's not a playoff game in recent years. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4651.88s)]
*  And then as I was thinking about that, I'm like, yeah, but you haven't had more [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4654.96s)]
*  fun, you haven't had more yelling in a house by yourself moments. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4657.78s)]
*  Then ant against the Pacers where he does what he does late and then he gets the block. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4661.56s)]
*  So, uh, I'm not going to sell texts. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4667.2s)]
*  He's had a couple where he just for three minutes, just completely destroys the [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4669.64s)]
*  other team and talk shit the entire time. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4673.360000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4676.24s)]
*  If ant Minnesota calls and they go look, I know this is a little weird, [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4676.56s)]
*  a little outside the box, little Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio here, but. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4683.56s)]
*  In, actually, none of it would work. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4688.179999999999s)]
*  So let's forget all the rules. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4689.98s)]
*  Let's forget all the cap rules and all that kind of stuff. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4691.46s)]
*  If they offered ant for Tatum, what would you say? [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4693.179999999999s)]
*  I, uh, it's younger, so you'd have to do it, right? [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4699.54s)]
*  You're getting four extra years from a basketball trade standpoint. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4704.62s)]
*  You'd have to, you'd have to, I, I don't know where he's going to rank on the trade [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4707.98s)]
*  value this summer, but, um, he will be in the top five, right? [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4714.96s)]
*  The question is, is, is Wemby at number one yet? [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4721.78s)]
*  Cause after what we saw the last six months, it's hard for me to believe [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4727.679999999999s)]
*  there's another asset in the league you'd want going forward than that guy. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4731.44s)]
*  But Yoko is like a guaranteed title every year or guaranteed finals [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4735.099999999999s)]
*  appearance every year, if he has a good team. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4738.879999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4742.639999999999s)]
*  I can't wait to see like what the second phase of the [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4742.88s)]
*  Yokoch thing is around it. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4745.7s)]
*  Because he just elevates people. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4748.3s)]
*  Cause they're going to have to kind of figure it out on the floor. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4749.74s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4751.82s)]
*  They're still pretty young actually, those guys, maybe they just run [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4752.18s)]
*  it back for a really long time. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4754.78s)]
*  Is Yokoch the only one the other GM hangs up on? [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4756.06s)]
*  Like if San Antonio calls and says, Hey, it's Wemby for Yokoch. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4759.62s)]
*  Denver's the only team that says no. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4762.52s)]
*  And then everybody else says yes for every single player in the league. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4764.12s)]
*  Is that where you're at? [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4766.72s)]
*  So I, Luca, maybe Luca Dallas. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4767.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4770.36s)]
*  I don't know how attached they are to Luca, but I think that's probably [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4771.32s)]
*  a longer meeting in the office. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4773.759999999999s)]
*  I'd say pretty attached. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4775.28s)]
*  Um, I, my thing with Yokoch for league pass MVP is it just kind of [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4777.04s)]
*  doesn't matter who's playing that night for them. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4782.679999999999s)]
*  He's still so much fun to watch. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4784.4s)]
*  It's like, Oh, that, that Murray. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4785.839999999999s)]
*  All right. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4787.5s)]
*  I guess he'll make it work with Reggie Jackson and Christian [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4788.24s)]
*  Brown bringing the ball up. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4791.919999999999s)]
*  It'll be fine. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4793.16s)]
*  He'll get to his 27, 15 and 14 or whatever. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4793.78s)]
*  Um, just the most reliable night to night offensive performer. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4797.34s)]
*  Um, probably I don't even know how far we'd have to go back, but it's way up there. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4802.34s)]
*  And I like that you can see, well, he's still young enough, but I don't think [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4808.66s)]
*  you have to worry about it ahead of time. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4813.4800000000005s)]
*  That's why I like 10 years from now. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4814.5s)]
*  I remember thinking this with Brady in 2014 being like, man, I'm going to [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4816.66s)]
*  fucking enjoy every Brady game. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4823.26s)]
*  Cause this is, I don't just don't know how many, you know, I'm going to, I [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4824.76s)]
*  know I'm in 10 years from now be like, fuck, I should have appreciated this more. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4828.24s)]
*  I'm not going to be that. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4832.2s)]
*  So I'm going to enjoy all of this. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4833.280000000001s)]
*  And I feel the same about the Yokoch just throwing them on TVs is the [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4835.04s)]
*  fucking it's everything I want from basketball. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4838.52s)]
*  My favorite part of it is that you can tell what he wants to do. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4842.56s)]
*  Like it's like an alarm, like almost like there's a thing on the ticker that'll [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4846.72s)]
*  say Yoko is going to look to exploit this for the next six minutes. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4850.52s)]
*  And then now Yoko isn't going to shoot. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4854.22s)]
*  Okay. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4856.780000000001s)]
*  Now Yoko is going to shoot based on, he, he's a little easier to kind of [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4857.080000000001s)]
*  identify like what it is he's trying to do. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4862.18s)]
*  Granted he has more touches than anybody in the game, but he will really change. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4864.820000000001s)]
*  Like LeBron does this too. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4870.02s)]
*  There's a lot of really great players that kind of use that first [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4871.780000000001s)]
*  quarter to feel each other out. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4874.26s)]
*  But with Yoko, it just seems easier to notice, which makes it more fun for [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4875.9400000000005s)]
*  everybody. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4879.740000000001s)]
*  Cause you can just see that game to game opponent defensive strategy against him. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4880.860000000001s)]
*  Cause so many people try different things against him. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4884.740000000001s)]
*  Be like, Oh, okay. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4886.780000000001s)]
*  This is what you're going to try to do. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4887.540000000001s)]
*  Now I'm going to try to do this. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4888.8s)]
*  Or you thought I was going to do this. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4890.1s)]
*  I'm actually not going to, I think the Miami game, he took six shots in the [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4891.68s)]
*  first quarter. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4895.46s)]
*  He took two the rest of the game. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4896.22s)]
*  He still was the best player. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4897.700000000001s)]
*  Now Graham BAM was incredible what he was doing against him, but he dominated [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4898.620000000001s)]
*  the game, taking two shots the rest of the game. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4902.580000000001s)]
*  No, he's reached out last level where I feel like sometimes, cause it's a long [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFEoII_s84&t=4905.42s)]
