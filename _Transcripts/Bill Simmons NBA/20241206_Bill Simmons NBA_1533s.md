# Are We Sleeping On The Hawks? Plus Favorite YesNo NBA Playoff Bets  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [December 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pl4y_RWkIw)
*  House quick basketball stuff. I was in Denver for a couple days with Brasilla. We did a great live show super fun
*  Gambling is legal in in Denver. I can actually get fan duel in
*  Denver and
*  I could make some fun bets
*  Which I did
*  including Jordan loves
*  200 plus yards with the four and a half which I were cashing
*  Yeah, but there were some future bets and it got me looking at some of the over under stuff and
*  To make the playoff stuff for the NBA. What do you think the Atlanta Hawks?
*  Regular season win total is right now on fandel the Hawks are 12 and 11. They've won five straight
*  43 I didn't look I haven't looked at it. It's 38 and a half house. Wow. Yeah
*  Yes, they have a bunch of high quality wins over the last
*  Ten days and we loaded way the f up on them getting to like 41 or 42 games and I have been I
*  Felt very validated, you know
*  Who's playing really effing good and was a key component of the handicap for why Atlanta could be capable of turning the page?
*  Deandre Hunter can that dude please stay on the floor keep the Andre Hunter healthy
*  Make sure he's getting his vitamins getting his sleep because he you know
*  The Dyson Daniels thing cannot be under under stated or underrated the addition of like a proper defense
*  Can I tell you I did stop? I love Atlanta. I did ringer 100
*  I had Dyson Daniels ahead of Dejante Murray in the ringer hundred and he was like 10 to 15 spots ahead
*  So it's your so so Atlanta won that trade by anyone that trade if it was
*  They also got Larry Nance and two first-round picks yeah
*  Yeah, so the Atlanta thing I was just startled by so of course I had to bet it and then I was like well
*  I might as well throw some other over unders in there might as well
*  So I did two different bets. What do you think Oklahoma City's?
*  Over under was heading into tonight. Oh, they want tonight. I haven't looked they won tonight. I think it made them 17 and 5
*  Let me guess I'm gonna say
*  58
*  So it's 57 and a half. I threw that in okay, okay
*  I did pretty good, and what do you think the Houston Rockets were playing as we tape?
*  What do you think they're over under was amazing?
*  Did we all three of us lock the Houston Rockets over now you guys did I didn't?
*  I
*  Bet the Rockets are now
*  46 and a half
*  Well, they were 42 and a half when we did it you and we're still locked it
*  Yeah, it was now 50 and a half on
*  Holy
*  Molly I know and you guess what?
*  I bet it anyway, so I did
*  Atlanta okay scene Houston plus 581 for the overs on that bang bang
*  then the other one I did I
*  Did those three what do you think Dallas is over under was they want tonight?
*  And by the way Dallas has been sneaky contendere for a few weeks
*  They have rounded into shape they were one of my locks in the preseason and their number was like in the 49 and a half
*  They weren't even a 50. I bet they're 50 now. I bet they're 50 now. You did not have them as a lock, but you did have them
*  But we yeah, they were I think they were 49 and a half in the preseason
*  Yeah, they're 50 and a half and they're 51 and a half now, so I put that in there fine
*  And then I had to the Lakers. What do you think the Lakers are right now?
*  It's got to be close to what the preseason was are they like 43 44 and a half, okay
*  So the gay a game and a half so before the year they're 42 and a half. Oh, okay
*  So 44 and a half that was the number that's great those five together Atlanta over okc over Houston over Lakers under Dallas over
*  was
*  Over 22 to 1 on Fandl
*  I
*  Put $100 on that you need to tweet that out
*  That's like so happy go get it so the Lakers would have to go 45 and 37 to beat that and they cannot guard anybody
*  Other than your wizards, so here's another one. I didn't bet this because I couldn't decide whether
*  It was a good line or not. What do you think the Wizards over under was heading into the game today?
*  Which they got killed in oh amazing
*  14 and a half that's what it was hey. Hey, I didn't even look
*  I
*  Look yeah, we didn't look at any of these no. I don't have to keep telling us we believe you
*  14 and a half and
*  My initial instinct was that's way too high and
*  Then I was like man if you win less than 14 half games
*  That's becoming one of the more unsuccessful seasons in the history of the league so I in the history of the league
*  I stayed away the Celtics were like 62 and a half which I was surprised
*  So here's the other thing I did
*  They have make the playoff bets and I was frantically doing this on the plane before the plane took off
*  I'm just gonna ask you if these teams will make the playoffs and you can tell me yes or no
*  Dallas Mavericks, yes
*  Houston Rockets, yes
*  Denver Nuggets
*  Yes, oh you pause the same way I did but yes, so Denver's number was minus 400
*  To make the playoffs, yeah, Minnesota Timberwolves
*  Yeah, yes, yes, yes
*  Phoenix Suns, yes
*  Okay, so I thought those five would make it as well Memphis Grizzlies
*  Awesome story. I honestly think they are going to make the playoffs. Yes
*  so
*  My thinking was those were the six
*  Teams other than okay, so
*  Okay, so those six in the west and I don't know who's getting the eighth spot you could tell me it's Golden State
*  You know it like what I you can tell me that was not dead
*  Those six with Atlanta
*  What do you think Atlanta's playoff odds were Atlanta to make the playoffs like decent?
*  They're gonna make I think they're gonna make the playoffs. Yeah plus 106. Yeah, so all of those together was over six to one
*  Mmm, okay, and I was trying to figure out who fucks the best
*  Okay, and I was trying to figure out who fucks that up Dallas Houston Denver Minnesota Phoenix Atlanta or Memphis like the odds would say Atlanta
*  Yeah, and yet if you watch Atlanta, I don't know how they're not gonna be a seven or an eight seed in the east
*  They can play defense. They try hard every night now. I think the coach likes the team they trade
*  They're getting a better version of him than they've had before they kind of got all their injuries
*  I'm not going wood for them because you know, yeah, we're rooting for them. We're invested in them
*  We feel like they owe us because we did this last season
*  They were that they were the fuck job team for it
*  We would have had like a legendary year last year with the over-under and they completely fucked us
*  Yeah
*  But I want to knock on wood and say they got most of their injury stuff out of the way at the beginning of the season
*  Hopefully because look the two wins that the Washington Wizards have
*  Back-to-back wins against the Atlanta Hawks, right?
*  Amazing right and if Atlanta wins those they're like 14 and 9 right now, right? I was looking at the game yesterday
*  It's like kind of the perfect box score
*  where
*  Capella 17 rebounds
*  Daniel is Dana says six assists three steals
*  Reese a shea hits a couple threes tray youngs terrible. He's six for 19 and
*  Jalen Johnson has a 23 13 and 5 and they beat Milwaukee by 15 points when trade doesn't even play well
*  To me that means they're a playoff team and on top of that
*  You know
*  I when I clicked into that game and saw early on that the Hawks were off a little bit up by a little bit
*  Like oh is the honest not playing? Oh, we honest was playing
*  because
*  Milwaukee is like the poor man's Denver this year to me
*  Yeah, they're only competitive if their super duper star is having an extra
*  Terrestrial performance another triple double by the way for for the Joker tonight
*  With 20 effing rebounds, but they're not competitive at all in the game Cleveland just dogwalks them the whole the whole game
*  you know, I I almost bet that when I was in Denver and
*  I just don't like betting. I just don't like betting. It's you okay
*  I love it's why you took the Denver over in the preseason
*  But it was one of those things or it's like this seems like a horrible matchup for them
*  Cleveland's just like way better around team. Yeah, I watched some that game. I had that on the small TV as I was watching the football game
*  Murray just isn't going by guys anymore, and I noticed it in person
*  we're still and I talked about our Denver pod, but
*  He's getting like he has the guy in his side. Mm-hmm
*  But he's not like getting the half step over them
*  the guy's just next to him and he can't ever really get to where he wants to go and I think it's a
*  Massive massive massive concern. I'm very worried about them house. I understand
*  yeah, so
*  Atlanta in the playoffs if you're just looking standings wise you figure Cleveland Boston Orlando New York and Milwaukee or locks to make the playoffs
*  I think those are the only five
*  Atlanta is the sixth seed right now, Miami's seven
*  Brooklyn's gonna start making trade soon because they don't want to be good
*  Chicago's kind of frisky and might not
*  There's a feel good story they had a big win tonight the play in Bulls
*  They can't wait to be in the 910 game in Indiana has lost one a row there nine and fourteen and
*  They might have the worst body language of any Eastern Conference team. They're the one what happened what happened to the Pacers?
*  so
*  I've asked around a little and I've also watched them and I think see Ockham's a really good player
*  Yep, and I'm not sure he fits in with how they played last year when we like watching them so much
*  Interesting those first two months when Hal Burton was great and they're flying up and down
*  Why then this year you put see Ockham in there you bring Mather and back who I think is a little alpha II
*  And it they just seem like more of a normal basketball team than the team that we watched last year
*  That was balls to the wall and they don't seem that happy to me. So
*  to me there East Coast, Minnesota where
*  the roster shifted and
*  Minnesota in a more obvious way
*  But they don't have the same kind of thing that made them special last year. Okay, and it was that pace
*  And I don't see the same pace this year. Do you know I?
*  Haven't sat down and done any deep looks at the Pacers. I just keep looking at
*  The outcomes of games and the box scores and trying to make sense out of why they're not they're not competitive in these games
*  They're like now blasted
*  Now and then you know, it's the classic year after syndrome, too
*  Right where is Hal Burton is there some kind of hangover from the Olympics? He didn't play in the Olympics
*  So it shouldn't have affected him
*  What's how about this?
*  How many how many points a game do you think they average this year?
*  Last year remember there in like the 120s. They were like 23 some crazy number. It's like 108 109
*  I don't know. I don't have it in front of me last year. They were
*  123.3. Yeah, what are they now?
*  this year
*  They're
*  113.4. Okay, they've lost 10 points a game
*  Yeah, and yet they have math or and they have siakham for a full season
*  So that doesn't make sense, but it does make sense if you watch them
*  They're not they don't play with the same pace tonight to me. They're the most I think the most likely
*  Trade team in either conference right now is in Vienna
*  Makes a ton of sense because they get like like Chicago they want but if you watch Chicago
*  They actually seem like they like playing with each other and they have like a specific identity
*  Indiana doesn't know what they are right now that that is the issue right like
*  Their identity they have to outscore teams because they don't they still don't defend
*  I mean I've gotten sat down and look at the dance numbers. They're there. I'm just minus five for the season
*  They're giving up one 18.2 and their score 113.4. So this is but this brings me to my Atlanta point. I
*  Just think Atlanta took their spot and I don't really see a path for Indiana
*  Unless there's some trade that they have come in, but they just signed siakham a huge deal, right?
*  Right, if you look at their miles turns be a free agent at the end of the year
*  If you look at their assets, they have they have Walker the kid
*  They took in the lottery two years ago that doesn't hasn't really had an impact for them
*  You look at their assets. I know they already traded a couple picks for siakham
*  On the other hand, I don't know for last year. That's good. I think they have some good, but I think he's the trade piece. Yeah
*  Which one them harder met Matthew I think Matthew is the trade piece. Okay, but he's good. I mean that's a good that should fetch something
*  One of the things that hurt with them is how many games is nice Smithness now
*  Yeah, he's only played six and I think that's one of the reasons their defense has gone backwards
*  Okay, but anyway the likely trade teams for me
*  Indiana no question
*  I'll be really interested to see what happens with Minnesota and Randall and whether there's even a market for him
*  hmm, I
*  went through all the teams like anyone interested in Julius randall for 33 and
*  Or 36 whatever he makes it gets really hard. It's hard to find takers
*  You end up like staring at like the Charlotte type of teams, but all those things are trying to tank now
*  Yeah, it doesn't make sense
*  I'm
*  I'm surprised why aren't we talking about the pelicans the pelicans isn't everybody available on the pelicans? I
*  guess but who
*  Ingram's an expiring. What are you getting for him? They just signed McCollum
*  He's making over 30 a year
*  Like is that is our people looking for all offense guards who can't guard anybody making 30 plus a year
*  That's a probably not I like McCollum, but is the right thing to do for them to just suck and get the very best
*  I think that's well, they beat Phoenix tonight. I had that game. I don't know what they were thinking. Damn it
*  Yeah, they broke their win streak the Zion thing is the most interesting
*  Story and sport. I mean New Orleans is in a weird spot because they don't really have anybody covering the team
*  They're they're the kind of this anonymous NBA team. They're playing a super small market
*  They don't even have like I didn't know who if there was stuff going on New Orleans. I don't even really know how we'd find out
*  Adam and Zion's coming back. They showed him on the bench today
*  He was he's wearing like one of those jogging suits where it was hard to tell if you'd put on 50 pounds or not. Oh
*  I know I just I'm very they can't trade him. They have Hawkins. I would say has some trade assets
*  So yeah, you're right. New Orleans is in there, but to me, Indiana
*  that's the one I'm watching short term because I think they have pieces there's moves and
*  I want to see if they do something and then the other one who I saw in person we're still and I'm really talking about in
*  the Denver show but
*  Golden State
*  Now they didn't have Draymond Draymond solves a lot of
*  Second ball hander stuff with them creating shots for people without him. Curry's really their only shot creator. Mm-hmm
*  They felt like a three-for-one team for me as I was watching them
*  They desperately need they have all these guys who are all fine and none of them can create a shot
*  so that when Denver just took out curry in the last five minutes, you know could just calling out every Warriors play and
*  And
*  They just didn't have that second guy who's like I got this
*  Let me let me get a couple buckets even something like math or and would be a huge help for them
*  so I
*  Left the game thinking I actually wouldn't be opposed to them trading for Zach ravine
*  Okay, and I don't know with this how the apron
*  I don't even know how trades work anymore whether it's even conceivable and doesn't have to match exactly
*  but that's the type of guy they need and
*  Curry being 36 I
*  Just don't think you can waste the window anymore. Otherwise just say you know what we are who we are and that's it but I
*  The last two years I felt that way with this team they just can't get him help
*  They just keep saying we're gonna you know
*  We're gonna roll the ball back out there with the guys that we got and they just got worse
*  I mean really they never recovered from Draymond punching Jordan pool in the face
*  It didn't a sentiment I kind of understand now, but you know the the it's been two seasons two full seasons
*  Then we got excited they won. They won in 22. So I don't
*  Don't shed tears for the Warriors, but no I'm not saying it right
*  But I think the burden that they have on curry now at the age that he's at is unrealistic
*  And I think they know it and I was watching last time
*  I was watching how hard he has to run around to get open and do all the curry stuff that he's been doing forever
*  But now he's doing it as a 36 year old
*  And I don't know basketball is really hard to play. Did you see that? There was that thing that came out about um
*  about
*  people running during basketball games and the amount of
*  the amount of miles you run during a year somebody tried to do a study on it to try to figure out and
*  basically took all the three-point shots in the pace of the game and
*  Figured out some formula to compare it to like the 80s the 90s
*  And it's just like there's way more running and sprinting now is basically the theory of it
*  and
*  It backed up what I've thought this
*  This as I go to the games it just feels like it's harder to play it just feels like you're
*  Constantly on the move sprinting doing rush outs
*  Flying around and I don't know I just think it's much more impactful mileage now
*  Yeah, cuz my biggest regret of our over-under's was the Phoenix one because I think we gave
*  Katie's health too much credit because he played so many games last year and
*  He's a guy has been in the league since the 2007 draft and like he's heard again
*  He's been hurt twice already this year, you know and and for what we were laying for that bet
*  Which was what was the over it was like 48 and a half something
*  Yeah, it was in the in the high 40s might have been 47 and a half though
*  Yeah, 47 and a half and all three of us did a lot. I don't regret it
*  Not yet, I'll regret it if if if he can't play
*  Yeah right now they're 12 and 9 we're gonna be sweating that one out
*  We are gonna be sweating that one because it's like one more injury and they look pretty ordinary means out there
*  Anyway, so and then Lakers I don't Lakers will do some sort of panic trade. I just don't know what it is
*  I think if they're actually trying to be competitive this year, they know that you can't play LeBron who's
*  By metrics like one of the five worst defensive players the league now with Reeves
*  With connect and with D lo you can't have those four guys on the basketball court at the same time
*  Unless you're trying to play a game that's like 145 to 143
*  So my guess is Reeves would be the trade guy. Oh, wow
*  Right because his contract and put it with something else. Maybe contract
*  Yeah, they still have that that first round pick in 29, right? Which is like super valuable
*  Would you trade Reeves?
*  Yes, definitely
*  I'm trying to see what his new you have to get have the right guy. But I mean he's like 15 million bucks a year
*  Yeah, he is great great price
*  twelve point nine thirteen point nine fourteen point eight. It's a great contract Russell's
*  18.6 expiring
*  So already that gets you over 30
*  Rui with 17 gets you to like the high 40s
*  Right. So now you could if you really wanted to make a run at an expensive guy you could but I'm sure
*  Ang is just waiting. He's just waiting for them to panic
*  Ang why what's a nice guy because Ang has all those pieces. He's got he's got John Collins at 26.5
*  he's got sextant at 18.3 Jordan Clarkson at 14 and he's got
*  Most importantly Kessler at three the Lakers are not taking any of those dudes. That's why they sextant in and
*  Sex is the only one sextant and Kessler would help them. They would they would genuinely help them
*  But like when they have late guys tar for Utah, that's like the best currency you could have the Lakers
*  Dangling Austin Reeves are they? Hey, you tie look the guy that I hear the guy that I would think that the Lakers would like have circled
*  Jimmy Butler that's who I would think that you know, they would be going in that direction, right?
*  They're not they're not and then we're not we're not going for Walker. That's fucking Kessler
*  We're gonna go get a big super duper big dong star
*  That's a tough guy and he's he's already on the banana boat and that's it. He's our dude something like Jimmy Butler. I
*  Like the way you're thinking us. Let me look at this for a second. So that would be Reeves
*  That would have to be basically Reeves Russell and Rui
*  Bye-bye
*  Enjoy and by the way all those guys would be like Miami. Yes
*  Kyle turn the tic-tac camera on here's what I actually think the Lakers should do I
*  Would trade Davis and cash in on him Wow
*  Wow and bead and bead for David
*  I would have been
*  Honestly, what would Davis be worth?
*  Every like everything
*  Like who can come up with enough?
*  Let's say he was in play for the Rockets
*  Would they have to think about that?
*  Of course, they'd have to think about yeah, of course. What kind of question is that? Yes. Yes. Yes a million yeses
*  I just don't think the Lakers are not trading Anthony Davis
*  If the goal is to win a title over the next four years the goal is to win the title this year or next they have
*  no chance
*  Zero chance no chance none of winning the title no chance
*  Zero
*  There is no way they there's a guy they need a guy
*  They need a time machine
*  They didn't need a time machine. Yes look
*  It's amazing that LeBron is still playing and that he can score 29 points in a game in his 22nd year in the league
*  They're not winning a title with them. They're not winning a title with the team they have and they can't play defense
*  And they know it no argument. They were 31 as healthy as he's ever been
*  themselves they became a three-point shooting team except for they can't shoot three
*  I'm gonna hold on to that clip that I sent you that's gonna be my
*  part of my
*  Where where the broad misses the entire rim?
*  He misses he misses so badly that the announcers like wide left
*  Even oh my
*  wide left
*  Yeah, that would be Indiana's my number one trade team now anyway, okay, that's it
*  That's my little basketball ball report for you. Who would you bet right now for the finals if you had to make a bet?
*  Oklahoma City and Boston
*  It's funny, I don't think that's changed
*  And yet I I continue to think Cleveland's really really good. They are really good and
*  I have Celtics fans in my life who aren't really focused on enough yet one of the things about them
*  Mitchell is a bad as unafraid of the Celtics as as any guy in the league
*  Like he really has so much confidence against them they have size and
*  There's still that a coral spot that I think I don't know if they're gonna try to upgrade that or whether they just like
*  the chemistry so much but
*  Yeah, I also would just counsel in favor of like don't be dismissive of the Knicks if the Knicks arrived the playoffs healthy
*  Those guys it's their alpha
*  They are not they they think that they they think that Boston is beta and they think that they're alpha
*  And that's gonna be a hell of a fistfight. I'm just telling you I welcome that one. Okay
*  I'm just telling you they think it'll be a fistfight and it might be next aren't the team. It's Cleveland's a team
*  Now the Knicks if Robinson can come back and actually be healthy. Yes, I
*  Think they're healthy. I figure there's a buyout guy for them
*  That we don't know who it is in February or beginning of March
*  But there's some guy they're gonna get who is excited to put the Knicks who has a relationship with Wes and Leon for sure
*  And there's some sort of deep in chenso replacement type swing that will be on their team that I don't know who it is yet
*  Is it is it could it can't be D even chenso he can't I mean he is trade you would like minute
*  You would like to come back Minnesota will be able to trade him. Yes. I don't do the blue trade Randolph. Anyway
*  You
