# OKC Beats Boston: A Postgame Reaction | Off The Pike
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [January 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw)
*  Bill I thought they were gonna get blown out at one point of the third quarter. They made a fight of it in the fourth but [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=0.0s)]
*  It's the first time I think all season long where I watched a Celtics game and I thought [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=4.96s)]
*  They may not be the most athletic team on the court like at times tonight [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=9.52s)]
*  Oklahoma City looked more athletic and it's a very rare thing to see but I I do like and look there's no moral victories [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=12.8s)]
*  But I do like the way that they fought back in the fourth quarter and I thought one thing [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=18.8s)]
*  finally, they put Tatum on Shea because [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=22.64s)]
*  I don't remember a time where Drew Holliday and Derek White both got blown by on defense in the first quarter of the game [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=25.52s)]
*  That's what happened with Shea. I think it just took them a little too long to get to that adjustment [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=31.52s)]
*  I was on a text ride with a couple Celtic fans talking about [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=36.96s)]
*  This was before the game [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=41.68s)]
*  Would Joe put Tatum on SGA A and then B? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=43.92s)]
*  When would he do it? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  Right because [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=49.28s)]
*  I think SGA and Brunson are similar you saw I don't know if you saw Nick's Minnesota the other night [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=50.56s)]
*  But they threw McDaniels on Brunson and Brunson had a lot of issues with it [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=55.2s)]
*  Like you have those these smaller guards and SGA is like six five six six [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=59.44s)]
*  But I want length on him [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=63.84s)]
*  I think white probably has a better chance [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  But I think they were probably worried about the foul trouble with him, but they waited they waited they put Jaylen on him [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=68.0s)]
*  and honestly, he kind of torched Jaylen and he [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=73.2s)]
*  Did pretty much whatever he wanted with any guard and then I thought Tatum had some real success against him in the fourth quarter [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=77.2s)]
*  And Brian this was the big question I had with this team [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=83.6s)]
*  If they actually want to win the title it can't and and where Tatum is at his point in his career [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=87.04s)]
*  There's going to be games where they don't need him to be the number one scorer in the team [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=93.36s)]
*  What they need is defense and rebounding he finished the game with 13 rebounds. I thought he played some really good defense on [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=96.64s)]
*  On SJ down the stretch and poor Zingas carried more of the offense load the guy that really just killed them in the game was Jaylen [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=104.0s)]
*  This was a bad [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=111.44s)]
*  2023 playoffs [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=113.18s)]
*  Jaylen performance he couldn't shoot he had his typical three [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  Unforced error turnovers and uh and wasn't good on defense either and I think if he played better, I think they would have won [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=118.56s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that's sort of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=125.12s)]
*  I don't want to say the most aggravating part because if you go back to like the beginning of the season [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=127.2s)]
*  We had questions about Jaylen and then in the month of december. He sort of turned it around [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=131.20000000000002s)]
*  He cut back his three-point shooting down in this game today [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=135.12s)]
*  He took eight three-pointers and it felt like he had no confidence in that shot whatsoever [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=137.76s)]
*  But the bigger point with that is you're right [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=142.16s)]
*  I mean you lose this game by four points and a guy that has been so good for you over the past month and change [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=144.16s)]
*  He was just atrocious in this game and I do think bad one in a while [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and I do and I do think that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=154.0s)]
*  If this game happened six weeks ago, I would have been concerned about it [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=156.64s)]
*  But today I just sort of chalk it up to he had a bad afternoon which I or the bad evening [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=160.32s)]
*  I should say and I guess that's the good thing is Jaylen played this poorly [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=165.12s)]
*  and you were still in the game and to your point on Tatum, I think it's a great one because [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=168.8s)]
*  Porzingis carried them in the first half in the first quarter [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=173.68s)]
*  He had 12 points and I do feel like in some sense [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=176.4s)]
*  I don't know what happened in the third quarter where they got they lost that quarter 40 to 25 and it felt like [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=179.36s)]
*  What got them the lead was playing through Porzingis? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=185.2s)]
*  We saw this so many times on the road trip going back to a couple of games in that series where [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=188.0s)]
*  The Lakers game third quarter they played through Porzingis you go to the Kings game [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  They played through Porzingis in the third quarter [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=195.6s)]
*  The third quarter had been an issue for this team for a large portion of the season [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=197.84s)]
*  They fixed this i'm just trying to figure out what happened tonight. I have answers for you [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  Okay [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=206.4s)]
*  So I think part of their game plan first of all their defense lost on this game [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=207.68s)]
*  We could talk about the third quarter, but then we talked fourth quarter, too [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  One of their game plans here was hey Josh Giddy. We're not afraid of you [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=214.88s)]
*  Feel free go nuts. Just let him shoot [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=219.76s)]
*  Josh Giddy was good in this game. First of all, he went four for seven from three [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=222.56s)]
*  Which he's an awful three-point shooter [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  So and they all of those they were like, please take those and they actually made them [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=229.12s)]
*  And they were putting Porzingis on them [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=232.96s)]
*  They were cheating Porzingis and trying to see if they could get away with him where they weren't afraid of getting shooting [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=234.56s)]
*  Put Porzingis on him then Porzingis can come and help on some of the other players [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=239.92s)]
*  Well, not only was Giddy making threes, but a couple times he went by Porzingis and created shots [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=244.08s)]
*  I just thought he played really well. He only played 27 minutes. He had 23 points. He was plus 10 [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  He had his usual rebound assist combo. So that was that and then [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=254.16s)]
*  In the fourth quarter, it was really three defensive possessions. I'm just doing this off top my head but [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=258.32s)]
*  Chet had two big threes in the last couple minutes both of them [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=263.92s)]
*  Were Porzingis doing the Rob Williams memorial? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=267.76s)]
*  I'm out with my hand up [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=271.76s)]
*  But I'm I'm a step and a half back from where I actually should be and Chet was able to line up and make it [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=273.03999999999996s)]
*  And then the one that shocked me so OKC they need a basket in the last minute [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=279.2s)]
*  Uh, Jalen Williams has the ball and [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=284.64s)]
*  It's SGA Tatum's on SGA and White's on Jalen Williams and they get a switch [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  To get SGA on White and then Jalen Williams takes Tatum off the dribble and he scored on him [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=294.24s)]
*  And that was the game because if they get a stop there, I actually think the Celtics could have won [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=300.47999999999996s)]
*  So to me those three possessions were the killers in the fourth quarter and then just Giddy just playing really well [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=304.71999999999997s)]
*  I thought really hurt him [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=310.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=312.08s)]
*  When there's two other one other play I would say is [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  I felt like all right Prichard deserved time to stay in the game because of the way that he played but at the end [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=315.28s)]
*  Of the game when it's a defensive possession, I would rather see Drew Holliday on the court because oh you would have [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=319.76s)]
*  You think? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=326.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=327.2s)]
*  Because you see what happened he ends up on the ground [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=328.56s)]
*  Jalen Williams just goes right through him and he gets an easy opportunity at the bucket and then the other thing to your point about [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=331.2s)]
*  Porzingis the dagger Chet three, I guess technically it wasn't the dagger because the Celtics had a chance on the other end [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=336.64s)]
*  Porzingis is just on that play and it's tough to criticize Porzingis after the evening [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=343.2s)]
*  He just had but there was no reason to help there like Tatum [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=347.52s)]
*  Shea had not beaten Tatum. Tatum had him at the top of the key and he's trying to drive on Tatum [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=351.6s)]
*  It wasn't like he had created an advantage where Porzingis has to cheat off Chet and instead [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=356.08s)]
*  He sort of cheated off him on that play and then I would say the other thing that sort of aggravated me in this game [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=360.71999999999997s)]
*  And this happened in the Warriors game, too [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=366.08s)]
*  Shea picked up his fourth foul with 8.52 left in the third quarter [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=369.03999999999996s)]
*  And they were hiding him right? So what I don't understand is [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=374.88s)]
*  It and it's not like the Celtics played well offensively as we mentioned [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=379.12s)]
*  They only had 25 points in that third quarter even a guy like Sam Hauser who was getting guarded by Shea [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=381.68s)]
*  They're purposely doing that because they don't think you'll put Hauser in any action and guess what the Celtics do [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=387.52s)]
*  They don't put Hauser in any action [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=393.04s)]
*  Instead he's just hanging out by the three-point line and I thought that was an opportunity to try to take advantage of the game [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=394.64s)]
*  Is try to get that fifth foul on Shea and I give them a lot of credit [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=400.32s)]
*  Okay, see Dagnall because this is something Brad Stevens used to do [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=404.32s)]
*  He wouldn't take his guys out when they got in foul trouble because Brad's rationale was okay [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=407.44s)]
*  Well, what am I just gonna lose five minutes pick to take them out of the game with five minutes? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=412.0s)]
*  And the other bet that Brad used to make which I think is the same bet that Dagnall bet on Missoula [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=415.68s)]
*  Is they won't go after him. I can hide my best guy and they're not gonna actually go after him [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=420.72s)]
*  So what was it was eight minutes left in third quarter when he got the fourth foul? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=424.96s)]
*  8.52 almost nine minutes left in because when that happened, I was like, oh my god, they're gonna win. They're gonna they're [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=429.52s)]
*  But you're right. They didn't attack them [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=435.36s)]
*  There's all kinds of things they could have done and maybe they'll learn from this [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=437.44s)]
*  But even like they could have played three guards at the same time [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=440.71999999999997s)]
*  You got to make him guard somebody and at least be in the mix and it didn't feel like he was in the mix [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=443.68s)]
*  Defensively at all. I agree that that was a huge mistake [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=449.12s)]
*  Yeah, it just doesn't really make sense to me that when especially it'd be one thing if it's just some random player [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=452.4s)]
*  But it's when a guy's on his way to having a 30 plus point performance [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=457.28s)]
*  It would seem like that's sort of the time that you want to go after [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=460.72s)]
*  Well, do you want to talk about the big picture angle of this game and I [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=464.0s)]
*  I thought I was on termini and eddie johnson's [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=468.16s)]
*  Um show today and I was saying how we do this ringer hundred that we we hand in our list like every month [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=470.64s)]
*  and I put [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=476.88s)]
*  Sga over tatum. I put I put him five [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=478.56s)]
*  Because i've watched too many of these games where he goes mano a mano with the other team's best player and his team wins [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=482.08s)]
*  Or he does better [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=487.6s)]
*  And I was just like I just think he's been more consistent in games like this [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=488.96000000000004s)]
*  You watched the game today. It was really close because tatum did a lot of good stuff that I mean he had as usual [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=493.20000000000005s)]
*  How many times does he just do the 28 foot pull up three where you're like, what are you doing? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=498.56s)]
*  He didn't both halves right there on shit on shit this on chat [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=502.40000000000003s)]
*  Just go buy him bounce into him get a foul. So he's still doing that but I loved how hard he played [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=506.24s)]
*  I love a heart that the sultics played [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=512.0s)]
*  Um, but sga was a tiny bit better and I feel like that's why they won. I will say this though brian [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=514.64s)]
*  um [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=520.1600000000001s)]
*  I think there were two awesome sultic games this year that really felt like finals games [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=521.2800000000001s)]
*  And it was this one and it was the minnesota game [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=526.5600000000001s)]
*  And they played other really good games like the my one of the miami games was good early in the season [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=529.12s)]
*  They there's they they've had good games. The golden state game was super entertaining [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=533.9200000000001s)]
*  The this game and the minnesota game felt finals level with so even if you look at the sultic stats [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=539.2800000000001s)]
*  They took 43s they took 29 free throws that's kind of where we want them to be right [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=546.8s)]
*  I don't want them to take 55 threes. I thought they went to the rim hard. I thought when they needed baskets they had [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=551.4399999999999s)]
*  Really nice balance the threes they took I thought were good white was fantastic again [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=558.16s)]
*  And weirdly it was good. This is the seventh loss of the season six of them that could have won [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=563.12s)]
*  They could have won this one [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=567.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I I would agree with that and they actually because what happened in the warriors game is they didn't take advantage of what the warriors [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=569.52s)]
*  Don't do well. The warriors are terrible in terms of defending without following they follow like crazy [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=575.84s)]
*  Yeah, the thunder that's one of their weaknesses is they follow a ton they commit [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=580.4s)]
*  I believe it's the fifth most follows in the nba [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=583.76s)]
*  or they give it the fifth most free throws and the celtics actually did get to the free throw line in this game and you [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=586.08s)]
*  Look at tatum in this one. He takes 10 free throws for zingas takes nine and even in this bad jalen game [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=590.48s)]
*  He still gets eight free throw attempts [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=596.48s)]
*  Which you like to see that from your star players because this is something that they've struggled with in the past and and 33 assists [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=598.08s)]
*  Yeah, so I mean the offense was not the problem in this game [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=605.36s)]
*  The defense became the issue in the game and it felt like it took them too long as we mentioned earlier to get [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=608.72s)]
*  To that jason tatum matchup the one other critique I would have in this game is they're down 18 now [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=613.6800000000001s)]
*  They make a comeback in the fourth quarter, but they're down double digit points to start the fourth [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=618.4s)]
*  And they come out with a lineup of al horford [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=624.48s)]
*  And luke cornet if you're trying to make a comeback in this game [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=628.0s)]
*  You need to do it offensively and I don't think cornet played poorly in this game [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=631.76s)]
*  I just don't understand the combination at that point of the game to go with the double big [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=635.6800000000001s)]
*  Line up there that to me was just a perplexing decision to go with those two guys on the court if anything [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=639.9200000000001s)]
*  I would say try to go small because if you look at that thunder team [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=644.88s)]
*  They don't play two bigs ever and it wasn't like you were getting an advantage out of the two bigs [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=648.32s)]
*  if anything [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=652.64s)]
*  I thought playing the two bigs actually hurt and maybe the numbers will say differently when the [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=653.2s)]
*  Data finalizes tomorrow in terms of the tracking data [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=657.92s)]
*  But it wasn't like okc was struggling offensively when you put two bigs on the court [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=660.88s)]
*  If anything it made him easier because you could get one of those guys in the action [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=665.36s)]
*  How many times have you seen the ball just flying around because cornet got caught up in some sort of set should have played? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=668.4s)]
*  We were that's a great point. Where was brissette because he had been I thought he played well for this team over the past couple of weeks [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=674.24s)]
*  He's a dmp [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=680.24s)]
*  Uh, what was the game you and I and chad fin were texting he played? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=682.4s)]
*  Oh that quipper game. I went to that game where he played 18 minutes [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=687.1999999999999s)]
*  They blew him out, but he was four for five from three and it felt like [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=691.12s)]
*  Joe was kind of getting into a rhythm with okay [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=694.72s)]
*  These are the guy and kada had a really good game that game then kada sucked against the lakers [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=697.04s)]
*  But I felt like brissette. I think his minutes had been yanked around. I think it's a mistake [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=702.72s)]
*  Like especially you're right a game like this. Why are you playing two bigs against the team? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=707.1999999999999s)]
*  They're dying for the other team to do something like that because they're small and they're but they want [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=711.84s)]
*  Give us big and slow. We're going to be able to move the ball around and attack them. I [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=717.44s)]
*  I think dagnaut is such a good coach. I mean, he's clearly [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=721.6s)]
*  Unquestionably a heavy coach of the year favorite right now, but you look at like [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=725.5s)]
*  You know, they're playing [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=729.6800000000001s)]
*  Wallace played 17 minutes as a rookie and by the way did not did they did not look great when he was out there [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=731.76s)]
*  But even like he uses isaiah joe [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=738.1600000000001s)]
*  And sometimes he'll play a lot of minutes this game [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=741.6800000000001s)]
*  He only played 13 minutes, but he has such a feel over who are my guys in this and i've seen him like pull the plug [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=743.6s)]
*  On giddy where giddy will just like oh giddy doesn't have it that he's out [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=749.44s)]
*  But he saw something with giddy in that matchup today [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=752.88s)]
*  And uh, I thought their best five played against our best five really [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=756.0s)]
*  Really well. Hey, we got think about this if I told you poor zingis was going to score 34 [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=760.32s)]
*  And that we were going to have 29 free throws and 33 assists [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=766.24s)]
*  Would you have said we were going to win? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=769.76s)]
*  Handily like by 15 20 points like oh we we blew out okc and okc [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=772.3199999999999s)]
*  But they you know, they scored 127 [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=777.52s)]
*  And she didn't really do that much in the fourth quarter. I bet he had what four points six points something like that [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=780.56s)]
*  Yeah, that was not the it wasn't his usual like lay the smackdown end of the game stuff [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=786.24s)]
*  It was chet and it was that jalen williams possession [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=790.88s)]
*  Yeah, there's a couple of things and there's like first of all just circling back to brissette [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=793.68s)]
*  And I know the celtics were able to get some offensive rebounds, but that's something that he does well [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=798.08s)]
*  Okc on the season gives up the 29th in offensive rebounds against at 13 [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=802.48s)]
*  I thought that especially because it felt like when they didn't get the offensive rebound [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=807.36s)]
*  We know that they're the best transition team in the nba [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=811.36s)]
*  So they were getting burned on the other end if you have a more athletic guy like brissette [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=813.36s)]
*  I think that sort of helps you instead of cornet and then [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=816.8000000000001s)]
*  The big picture stuff you were mentioning the thing that scares me about this thunder team [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=819.44s)]
*  I do think like say it knock on wood that this happens. They both get to the finals [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=823.28s)]
*  That's a difficult matchup for the celtics and [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=826.8000000000001s)]
*  Okc now like we think about these windows for the celtics [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=829.28s)]
*  It kind of scares you looking into the future because they're gonna have chet forever [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=832.88s)]
*  They're gonna have shea forever and they can make a move if they really wanted to [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=836.5600000000001s)]
*  This upcoming trade deadline. I don't know what three like [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=841.12s)]
*  Kenridge williams played 13 wiggins played 13 mechich played 11 azalea joe played 13 [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=844.8000000000001s)]
*  But you take two of those guys and just give 26 minutes [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=851.0400000000001s)]
*  To like a kick-ass dude who becomes like a seven eight man rotation guy [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=855.28s)]
*  um, I listen they [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=860.08s)]
*  To me, they're one of the five teams that can win the title and shea is one of the best five players in the league [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=862.24s)]
*  And for them to not pursue this seriously, I would be if I were them [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=866.72s)]
*  So encouraged by what I saw from chet not only in this game [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=871.28s)]
*  But against denver against minnesota a team that you think like oh minnesota should be able to overpower them [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=874.96s)]
*  They just have chet that in chet holds his own. He's tough as hell. He protects the rim [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=880.32s)]
*  He's really crafty with sga in that high screen stuff [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=885.2s)]
*  I think that's their hardest play to defend like you're [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=889.0400000000001s)]
*  If they put a little switch in or chet pops off your big guy better be ready to fly out there [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=891.84s)]
*  Anti rob williams style. I think they're really hard to play but on the flip side like [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=897.82s)]
*  I it's weird the celtics lost but I this game made me feel better about them [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=902.88s)]
*  The fact that they were smart enough in the fourth quarter to put tatum on shea. I thought was [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=907.36s)]
*  I was kind of proud of second row joe. I was like, okay [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=911.9200000000001s)]
*  You did it. I didn't know if you're gonna have the balls to do that. You did it and from tatum's standpoint [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=915.12s)]
*  All right, don't get in the hero ball contest with shea like fucking guard them [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=920.32s)]
*  Take them out on that end and trust your teammates and I thought that was really encouraging [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=924.72s)]
*  Yeah, and the fact that tatum wanted to match up too because yeah [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=930.24s)]
*  That he wanted it and we've seen him do it before going back to a couple of years ago against kevin durant in that series [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=933.52s)]
*  Against brooklyn where durant was like horrible against tatum and tatum deserves a lot of credit for that [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=939.04s)]
*  So maybe that is something because I do think we talked earlier in the season how this is sort of an adjustment period for jalen [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=944.24s)]
*  But tatum in this game had to have realized that hey [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=950.4s)]
*  This is going to be more of a porzingis game [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=952.72s)]
*  And I know he's still finished with his 30 points and all that but porzingis at times and in a lot of games [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=954.32s)]
*  Is going to be the biggest advantage the celtics have so that means that tatum's going to impact the game in other ways [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=959.92s)]
*  We've talked in the past about how he's a great rebounder [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=964.56s)]
*  But on the defensive end of the floor taking on that matchup was huge [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=966.88s)]
*  And I do think going back to your point about how this is sort of encouraging [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=970.4s)]
*  I think the big thing we've seen in a lot of these wins is [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=974.48s)]
*  And I know they lost tonight [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=977.76s)]
*  But there have been so many games this year where I felt like if they didn't have porzingis they would have lost the game [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=978.8s)]
*  So I do think it's sort of a blessing and a curse the blessing is the fact that [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=984.3199999999999s)]
*  Okay, they do finally have this advantage you've brought up on your pod before like they were sick and tired of getting into these [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=988.88s)]
*  postseason series where their offense just gets stuck in the mud it gets stale and if the threes aren't falling or if tatum or [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=993.9s)]
*  Jalen's turning the ball over late [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=999.92s)]
*  So I think you now have that answer as long as porzingis is healthy because [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1001.6s)]
*  The first quarter of this game and really into the second quarter [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1005.92s)]
*  The celtics probably get blown out of the building if they don't have porzingis in this game to just go to the way shay was playing [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1008.56s)]
*  Yeah, I agree [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1014.16s)]
*  Yeah, and I think the one thing he can do too, especially in this game where that team likes to play fast and [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1014.88s)]
*  Indiana's gonna they're gonna play indiana again coming up soon another team that likes to play fast [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1020.54s)]
*  milwaukee to a lesser extent likes to play fast is and I know it seems like [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1024.72s)]
*  Not the most effective strategy because you're the celtics and you're super athletic [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1028.8s)]
*  But sometimes it's useful to just slow the game down and give porzingis the ball because [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1032.48s)]
*  Like when he gets the ball at the nail there at the free throw line [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1037.04s)]
*  Yeah [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1039.84s)]
*  There's nothing you can really do and because if you bring help he's a good enough passer to kick it out [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1040.16s)]
*  The one thing that i've been really impressed with is [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1044.96s)]
*  He just shoots over guys like it's it's as if the defender anybody that's shorter than him [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1047.76s)]
*  It's as if the defender is not even there like I haven't seen anybody you see him against wemby [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1052.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1057.0400000000002s)]
*  What was it like an inch apart? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1058.48s)]
*  Maybe like an inch and a quarter. They were you look small [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1060.5600000000002s)]
*  They were they you how how much taller do you think wemby was in him? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1064.3200000000002s)]
*  Is he two inches taller [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1068.8s)]
*  I would have said like an inch and a half. I I was shocked by [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1070.8s)]
*  Because everyone says porzingis is seven three and what you're saying like i'd not foul line shot [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1074.56s)]
*  You could feel it in the detrit game [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1080.48s)]
*  It seems like his shot's gonna get blocked when you're watching on tv because you have this down angle on it, right? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1083.12s)]
*  But every time he gets a shot off nobody touches it. Nobody blocks it and the post-up stats [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1088.56s)]
*  I mean one of the things that's I i'm gonna be interested to see how they experiment with it as the season goes [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1093.52s)]
*  Along porzingis, I think is second for post-up per 100 like his points per possession on post-ups [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1097.92s)]
*  He was at like I think it was 1.48 points per hundred [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1105.04s)]
*  Yeah, but then tatum was seventh and I think jaylen was like 11th [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1108.96s)]
*  and [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1113.44s)]
*  There's always somebody that's too small for one of those three guys whoever they're playing [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1115.28s)]
*  And I think as the season's going along they're starting to figure out like oh you're gonna guard porzingis with him. Okay [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1120.0800000000002s)]
*  And they're kind of surgically taking this stuff apart [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1125.8400000000001s)]
*  So I as I watch them [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1128.88s)]
*  I just feel like this team is starting to get more sophisticated over who they are also [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1130.8s)]
*  like porzingis hasn't shot the three that well and this is something that [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1136.0800000000002s)]
*  If you know, this is what part of the advertisement with porzingis, right? It's supposed to be this 40% three-point shooter [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1140.24s)]
*  We haven't seen that piece totally yet when that gets unlocked [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1146.0800000000002s)]
*  I don't know if the derrick white three-point shooting is sustainable like I mean [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1149.76s)]
*  I know everybody's been talking about for five weeks [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1153.8400000000001s)]
*  But he made three of like the craziest threes of the season for him like the like kind of coming off [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1155.68s)]
*  of semi-fast break one-footed off balance threes like he was uh, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1162.0s)]
*  I don't know paul pierce in the mid 2000s. Um, i'm not sure how sustainable that is, but I do think porzingis can get better [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1167.92s)]
*  to uh [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1175.04s)]
*  Highlight the point you made so porzingis is at one four one point four eight points per possession on post-ups and tatum is at one [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1176.4s)]
*  Point two three and the best offense in the nba is like one point two two [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1182.6399999999999s)]
*  So those are both but in both of those are top seven right porzingis is like second. Yeah [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1185.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, porzingis is one of the most he's been he at for a while. He was the most efficient post-score in the nba [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1190.56s)]
*  He's dipped a little bit below that but I mean he's still as efficient as all hell [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1195.84s)]
*  But the other thing you mentioned about porzingis and the three-point shooting even if it's not there [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1199.76s)]
*  The fact that he's willing to take it from that deep [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1204.32s)]
*  Guys are still defending it right? Like this is the difference and there's a lot of differences between the two players [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1207.8400000000001s)]
*  But even when al was having that outstanding shooting season last year where his top five in the nba and three-point percentage [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1213.6000000000001s)]
*  He was never defended like this with porzingis. The defense is still freaked out about it now [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1220.16s)]
*  Derek white I still think that he can finish the season north of 40% from three [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1225.52s)]
*  I think he's good enough to do that because a lot of these are [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1230.0s)]
*  Stand still threes that he's getting the one thing that he actually has been doing about 50% [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1233.0400000000002s)]
*  Because that's where he's been for like five weeks. I don't know if 50% is realistic [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1237.52s)]
*  Yeah [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1242.16s)]
*  Well all these all these guys the top of your top eight rotation guys with the exception of jalen who actually did shoot [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1242.3200000000002s)]
*  38 from three in december outside of jalen tatum and porzingis the rest of those guys [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1248.5400000000002s)]
*  Hauser pritchard al white and holiday [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1254.0s)]
*  They all shot north of 40% from three [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1257.1999999999998s)]
*  In the month of december and the other thing the celtics did a lot [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1260.2399999999998s)]
*  Better this past month in december compared to where they were at earlier this season is [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1263.36s)]
*  We actually finally saw them do other things besides take threes like if you just take their last six games prior to tonight [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1268.7199999999998s)]
*  Fifth in points per game in the paint their first 26 they were 26 the free throws [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1275.84s)]
*  And they took a bunch tonight as you mentioned they were 11th in their last six games their first 26 [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1281.04s)]
*  They were 24th and they did mention [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1285.92s)]
*  Joe mazula mentioned it but also guys in the team mentioned they found different things offensively like they were actually playing faster [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1288.8799999999999s)]
*  They were getting that more fast break points as well [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1294.6399999999999s)]
*  so I do think if is that sort of starting to come together because [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1297.12s)]
*  I felt like the offense was sort of behind the defense earlier in the season [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1300.48s)]
*  And I do feel like they've sort of found and a lot of it goes with jalen outside of tonight sort of finding [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1304.16s)]
*  Derek playing better too. Yeah, and derrick derrick white playing better and I thought drew finally shooting the ball better as well [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1308.8s)]
*  Until tonight, um the poor zingus one thing i've been surprised I [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1314.96s)]
*  You know, I obviously followed his career and watched him and saw him a bunch [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1319.0400000000002s)]
*  But I was not watching him on washington. I felt like a dallas. He was kind of an afterthought on the side [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1322.4s)]
*  He's a really good transition player [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1327.7600000000002s)]
*  Like in the air stuff alley oops, um hustling down like he really he hustles I think way more [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1330.64s)]
*  For points than I was expecting like he's a really hungry player and I his great hands like he catches [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1338.3200000000002s)]
*  Those like when he's rim running he'll catch these passes like on the break room [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1343.84s)]
*  Like you probably shouldn't be throwing a seven foot three guy that pass and somehow he makes the catch and the other thing [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1348.8s)]
*  I think he does too. Don't you think he's like a phenomenal athlete like I'm actually kind of stunned by how athletic he is [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1353.6s)]
*  I am too and the way that he finishes with traffic around him is incredible too [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1360.0s)]
*  Like and to your point, I remember when the celtics were in I know the celtics have been interested in for a couple of years [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1364.48s)]
*  But when they made the trade i'm like looking i'm not going to pretend that I watched a lot of washington wizards basketball last year [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1371.6s)]
*  But I just remember looking at the numbers like the post-up numbers and the two-point shooting all that i'm like [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1378.08s)]
*  Holy shit, like this is kind of ridiculous. This is what house was telling me why that was his scouting report [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1382.8799999999999s)]
*  He's like here's the thing you can't you can't cheat with this dude [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1388.1599999999999s)]
*  You can't put a smaller guy on him or try to hide somebody on it because he will take that dude down and score on him [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1392.0s)]
*  And he was adamant like that was this part of poor zingas's game that he didn't realize he had and [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1397.04s)]
*  I've been stunned by that. I've been stunned by the in the air stuff [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1402.24s)]
*  Because I don't know in my head. I just felt like he was this three-point shooting [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1405.76s)]
*  Kind of stationary clumsy-ish [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1410.24s)]
*  Seven foot three guy and he's not that at all. He's he's [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1412.8s)]
*  almost plays like uh [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1416.08s)]
*  I don't know like he's 6 11 or something. It's it's he's really impressive and they of course none of this will matter if he gets hurt [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1418.1599999999999s)]
*  before may [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1424.1599999999999s)]
*  Well, and I do think that's an interesting component to this is because what we've seen lately is [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1426.0s)]
*  He's not playing back to backs. He has not been playing back to back slightly. I know for a fact they don't they don't [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1430.8s)]
*  They they want to get him 100. They're not messing around. They know who they are [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1436.56s)]
*  They know they're going to be in the top. They'll be in the top three, right? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1441.2s)]
*  They'll be one two or three probably one and bead's been healthy the whole year [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1443.84s)]
*  Dame's been healthy the whole year and dame does not have a great injury history [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1447.76s)]
*  I think they feel like with what they have they're probably going to be the one seat anyway [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1451.76s)]
*  And they're just not putting miles on him. They're not going to do it [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1455.28s)]
*  Well, I think it's smart. The one thing I don't agree with with the way they're handling this is we know that [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1458.0s)]
*  Horford isn't playing back to back back to backs either and I agree with that. But here's the problem [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1462.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't know why they keep doing this thing [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1467.6s)]
*  Where they play them both on the first end and then they play neither one of the guys on the second end [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1470.1599999999999s)]
*  I don't know if that's like an opportunity to get kata and brissette and cornet minutes [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1476.3999999999999s)]
*  But I would just separate that [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1481.68s)]
*  I don't know why you need poor zingus and al both sitting out when you know going into a back to back that neither one is [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1483.28s)]
*  Going to play both of them. My only rationale behind it is i'm guessing maybe that's when they want to find out what they have [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1488.8s)]
*  with some of these [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1494.96s)]
*  Bench guys, but it's weird now because kata sort of it feels like now he's out of the rotation when he was in the rotation [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1496.0800000000002s)]
*  For a while they've gone sort of back to cornet and I do think like that's the one thing that [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1502.24s)]
*  I would like this was not a kata game. He's there's no way we were seeing him tonight [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1507.52s)]
*  Well, he can't he like he's he's not gonna play defense against these guys, right? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1510.96s)]
*  Like he can't he can't play defense [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1514.32s)]
*  Like he really he can only play a drop and he's not really good in the drop coverage right now [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1515.92s)]
*  But I do wonder like his game was tough for him that I think that was one of those like, oh, okay [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1519.28s)]
*  We got some work left here [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1524.24s)]
*  But I do wonder like is there one more guy they need to give minutes to like is brissette somebody that needs to play [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1525.8400000000001s)]
*  More often. Yes does or are they gonna have to address that at the trading deadline? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1532.08s)]
*  I would just let brissette go like I think he brings too much to the table not to play him [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1536.32s)]
*  I think you're right on both. I'm gonna go yes and yes that the thing with kata [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1540.96s)]
*  There's certain matchups where he becomes important like when it's somebody like a zoo bots [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1546.4s)]
*  Where it's and then he was great in that quipper game because zoo bots is a certain type of player [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1551.2s)]
*  He rolls to the basket. He's his arms are always around the rim and it's perfect for kata [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1556.24s)]
*  The team tonight is not a good like him against chad homerun now [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1561.92s)]
*  I'm a little nervous, but I think like, you know that he was a high second on pick for the kings two years ago [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1565.12s)]
*  kata [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1572.0s)]
*  And yeah, the kings are the kings so and maybe just the kind of style they play they just kind of uh [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1572.96s)]
*  Gave up on him, but I to me he's on a two-way [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1578.32s)]
*  But I assume they're gonna probably lock that down by the end of the year. They don't need to anytime soon [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1581.44s)]
*  but he's [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1586.8799999999999s)]
*  He's at least a body for the playoffs. I still feel like [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1588.1599999999999s)]
*  Um [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1591.76s)]
*  If it's not per set then they need to go find who that is [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1592.7199999999998s)]
*  But the biggest thing for me is the defensive guard with size. I just feel like that's [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1595.6799999999998s)]
*  There's games and you could feel it a little bit even though pritchard played pretty well today [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1600.1599999999999s)]
*  There's games where he just seems too small [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1603.9199999999998s)]
*  when he's out there and every guard and forward on the other team is six foot five six foot six and up and [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1606.48s)]
*  Um, there's just times athletically where I feel like he it gets a little dicey. Don't you think? [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1613.36s)]
*  Yeah, and especially in this game tonight [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1619.68s)]
*  I mean when he's on jalen what yeah like he's given up too much size and he's given up too much weight and [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1621.44s)]
*  This is somebody me that I like pritchard. I think he's a good player [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1626.96s)]
*  I think he's a very useful player during the regular season [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1629.76s)]
*  But like going back to the heat series last year remember game one [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1632.64s)]
*  I can't remember for his you or pina came on after that game and it's like [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1636.16s)]
*  He's on the court when jimmy butler's on the court and they just like immediately [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1639.84s)]
*  Jimmy butler like almost couldn't believe it in the fourth quarter. He's like yeah, like i'm gonna go and get him [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1643.44s)]
*  So yeah, I just I just wonder what they have resource wise right because you're not trading like one of the top six guys [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1648.08s)]
*  So from a financial standpoint, they don't really have a lot to trade [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1654.56s)]
*  I mean is it is it the is it austin rivers? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1658.08s)]
*  Like is is he trying to make his way back in the league or he's just living the pod life? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1661.12s)]
*  There's going to be a bunch of buyout guys because we have four horrible teams [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1665.6799999999998s)]
*  the bottom four in this league are really really bottomy and [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1670.1599999999999s)]
*  Maybe somebody like that, but I don't know. I don't think they're that worried about it because [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1674.56s)]
*  Once you get you you don't have to worry about until february the the thing [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1679.6799999999998s)]
*  I had to worry about one thing and i'm not 100 worried about this yet [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1684.0s)]
*  But as you know because we've texted about it a few times [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1688.9599999999998s)]
*  It's like where are we in drew's career right now? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1694.24s)]
*  What what checkpoint are we in in the drew holiday experience because [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1699.36s)]
*  He looked I would say a half step slow from where he was at his all-time peak probably two years ago [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1704.1599999999999s)]
*  2021 drew [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1711.5s)]
*  But we also do we got hurt at the start of the season so it's like all right [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1714.48s)]
*  He's getting then he really started to look good the last couple weeks and he's like there's drew holiday. Yeah, that's the guy [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1717.36s)]
*  Um and him guarding lebron was great. I I thought on christmas [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1723.9199999999998s)]
*  I thought he got in lebron's head, which I didn't even think was possible at this point, but [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1728.08s)]
*  Uh lebron was afraid to turn and dribble against him and he really I thought [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1732.4s)]
*  Affected the game [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1736.88s)]
*  I did not think he was good tonight [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1738.4s)]
*  And this was a game that I thought he was going to be really important and and part of it might have been just [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1739.92s)]
*  What they were doing with the lineups and putting poor zingis on giddy. I'm sure if they had to do that over again [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1744.5600000000002s)]
*  Maybe you just put drew on giddy and try to take giddy out and make sure he doesn't have a good game [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1749.3600000000001s)]
*  but [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1755.52s)]
*  Um, you know seven points tonight two for eight [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1756.3200000000002s)]
*  Two free throws minus 15. Um, they didn't play him in crunch time [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1759.2s)]
*  Just it just kind of made me go. Hmm [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1765.04s)]
*  This is a guy who we were talking contract extension at the end of the year [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1767.04s)]
*  And this was one of the two biggest games of the year and he didn't play in the last five minutes [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1770.64s)]
*  Yeah, and he had some real issues finishing earlier this season [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1775.8400000000001s)]
*  He still had some of those and we saw that one play tonight where he tried to go up and under against shay [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1779.6000000000001s)]
*  And he or excuse me against chetney just kind of threw it up in the air [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1784.32s)]
*  So I think going back to al and poor zingis when we talk about drew [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1787.8400000000001s)]
*  I wonder if you got to start doing that with him a little bit not say every back to back he sits out [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1792.3200000000002s)]
*  But maybe you got to start thinking about resting him because think about his career recently go back to last year [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1797.1200000000001s)]
*  He's overtaxed in the postseason trying to be the number two option at times when yanis goes down [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1802.96s)]
*  He's trying to be the number one option at the same time. He's covering jimmy butler on one end [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1808.0s)]
*  Going all the way back to 2021 [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1813.04s)]
*  Going all the way back to 2021. He's playing deep into the playoffs when he wins the finals and then the following season [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1814.56s)]
*  They have that grueling series against the celtics [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1820.0s)]
*  I just think there's a lot of mileage there and the one thing i've noticed about drew [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1822.72s)]
*  Wait, hold on on that point. He's over a thousand games combined regular season and playoffs now and a thousand [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1826.32s)]
*  You know things have changed and we're in the 2020s guys longevity. I get it, but the thousand mark [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1833.12s)]
*  Is usually anything after a thousand if you're still playing at a really high level is a bonus in my opinion [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1839.92s)]
*  So yeah, i'm just i'm monitoring it. But anyway, go ahead well, and I think his biggest attribute now is [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1846.0s)]
*  Not as like a guy that you just put on somebody to take out of the game [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1852.88s)]
*  I think it's more about his defensive versatility like we've seen him cover yanis and we've seen him cover [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1856.08s)]
*  Embiid we've seen they put him on anthony davis at one point during the third quarter [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1861.3600000000001s)]
*  We've seen him cover lebron [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1865.6s)]
*  But what I wonder about with drew is we talked about before the season like hey [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1867.1999999999998s)]
*  This may be the best guy to cover dame and like you can go all the way back to the new orleans series that he played [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1870.9599999999998s)]
*  Against them. I don't know if that is his best thing anymore [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1875.12s)]
*  And it's not a problem for the celtics because you have derek white that can cover the elite guards like and I know that jimmy butler [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1877.76s)]
*  Sort of gave it to him and jimmy was talking back and forth them in that series against milwaukee [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1883.76s)]
*  But I actually think at this point in his career [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1888.0s)]
*  He's better guarding up than he is actually covering like the traditional like whether and look [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1890.64s)]
*  This teammate aren't gonna make the playoffs [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1895.92s)]
*  But like the darrius garland types the damien lillard types the tyrese haliburton types like those quick guards [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1897.2s)]
*  I don't think those are his best matchups anymore [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1904.48s)]
*  I think it's more of like the swing the bigger twos the threes and the fours and even to a lesser extent [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1906.8s)]
*  Centers and it's good that you have derek white to do that guys [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1912.4s)]
*  Yeah, like I feel like we saw it a couple times tonight and look shea does it to a lot of people [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1915.12s)]
*  But like he had drew holiday. They were neck and neck and all of a sudden he's at the rim [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1919.68s)]
*  And yeah, shea shea's not fair because he just he's destroyed every single person in the league [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1923.76s)]
*  I what I agree and I disagree with you because [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1928.72s)]
*  On the one hand you're right. He's [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1932.24s)]
*  We've seen over and over again now. He has been unable to really truly lock down [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1934.3999999999999s)]
*  scoring guards [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1940.24s)]
*  Um on the flip side, I watch basketball every night [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1941.68s)]
*  I don't see anybody doing it and it goes back to like the stuff [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1945.52s)]
*  Steve kerr was talking about a couple weeks ago about how hard it is to just play defense anymore [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1949.04s)]
*  I don't really see any lockdown defensive point guard defense out there [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1954.3999999999999s)]
*  I think white is the best defensive guard in the league right now him and caruso [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1958.3999999999999s)]
*  Are probably you know, there's a couple other guys but [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1962.3999999999999s)]
*  White if you're gonna say like who brings the most to the table defensively [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1965.2s)]
*  It's probably derek white and there's been guys who've been going by derek white all season [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1968.3999999999999s)]
*  You know because it's really hard to play defense and not foul so [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1972.8000000000002s)]
*  I think what where drew becomes really fun [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1976.64s)]
*  especially if you're thinking a playoff series is [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1979.6000000000001s)]
*  You know that when he's guarding jimmy butler or when I know he did do it well last year [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1982.96s)]
*  But when you throw him on yanis for for a series when you put him on embiid he's he becomes like a little marcus smartish [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1987.5200000000002s)]
*  Um, but I you know going team by team who they're going the playoffs like when they play brunson [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=1994.48s)]
*  You probably gonna have to put tatum and and brown on him as much as derek white like length bothers brunson when you play dame [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2000.8s)]
*  I'm not sure anybody's staying in front of dame if he's playing well, you know, and [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2009.76s)]
*  So to me the the bigger thing for me is his offense and how can you unlock that a little bit more because I like [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2015.4399999999998s)]
*  When he has the ball the big thing [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2020.24s)]
*  Just in general for the season is that they trust white it's by the week. They're trusting him more with the ball the [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2022.72s)]
*  Running setting picks for him having him in transition that guy has so much confidence now with his three-point shooting and getting to the rim [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2029.2s)]
*  It's unbelievable. It's like I remember you and I were talking after the market smart trade [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2035.76s)]
*  The number one reason I think both of us like the trade so much [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2040.32s)]
*  It was like finally derek white can be unleashed because both of us believed in the stats the stats were there like [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2043.2s)]
*  When this guy has the ball in his hand good things happen [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2049.2s)]
*  And good things have been happening since they gave him the ball and I wonder like, you know [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2052.72s)]
*  I know he was 25 and 5 in december. Do you think that goes up? [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2056.24s)]
*  Does he get to like does he become like a 22? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2059.8399999999997s)]
*  6 and 6 guy or or is december the ceiling? [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2063.2s)]
*  I think this is probably where he levels out because I I just don't think he's going to take many more shots, right? [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2067.04s)]
*  And I don't see them and I don't think think the percentages stay like where they are right now [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2072.64s)]
*  I think they can stay in a similar area [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2077.2799999999997s)]
*  But to expect to like 50 40 90 is I think realistic that he actually like finishes somewhere around there [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2079.3599999999997s)]
*  But I just don't think about two blocks a game [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2086.24s)]
*  Yeah, unbelievable. I mean that streak he had where it's like [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2089.04s)]
*  Ron harper he tied ron harper for four games in a row with three consecutive blocks [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2092.0s)]
*  And then he had like the most blocks ever for a guard in like a six game span [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2096.3199999999997s)]
*  How about the one today? Who's the one he had the block in the first half was that shay? [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2100.0s)]
*  It was literally on a lob attempt. He broke up a lob attempt as a guard, right? [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2104.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2110.0s)]
*  Speaking of that like the the two plays that poor zingus made in that in the first half too where first of all like jalen [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2110.3199999999997s)]
*  Got lost he came over and had a block on misich whatever that guy's name is and then he had another one too where [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2115.44s)]
*  He challenged the shot at the rim misich passed it and then he still got the block on a different a different offensive player [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2121.28s)]
*  Which was phenomenal to your to your point on white by the way [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2127.92s)]
*  He's in the 91st percentile as a pick and roll ball handler one point zero nine points per 100 possessions like obviously [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2130.32s)]
*  Dame has way higher volume, but he's he's like more efficient than damian willard not to say that he could do it on the same [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2138.7200000000003s)]
*  Usage, but my point being that's how efficient he's been and I do feel like at times like that is their best [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2144.64s)]
*  Late game offense when they go now tatum did I thought tatum did a good job making decisions late in this game [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2149.84s)]
*  But we saw I forget which game it was on the road trip if it was [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2155.52s)]
*  Was it the lakers or the kings whatever it was like it definitely wasn't the kings [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2159.2s)]
*  I think it was the lakers where they played through derrick white and christoph spore zingus late in the game [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2162.56s)]
*  It was like high pick and roll for derrick white and if he was like he always makes the [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2167.92s)]
*  Right decision when it comes to that in terms of drilling today [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2172.2400000000002s)]
*  Do you see that they actually posted up tatum on a play in the last minute where they needed a basket i'm like, oh [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2175.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so they can go to mba.com and cleaning the glass and they they're starting to realize that [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2182.0800000000004s)]
*  Actually, this is one of the eight best plays you can run in the end right now [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2187.0400000000004s)]
*  Well, and that's why I do think that they're doing a better job of just like hey when tatum gets a switch [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2191.36s)]
*  Just give it to him because this is the one thing that aggravates me about tatum [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2196.5600000000004s)]
*  His post-up numbers are great. Actually if you look at his isolation numbers, which have not been great in the past [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2199.92s)]
*  They've been great this season the one thing and he only took five threes tonight [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2204.56s)]
*  Which is like an accomplishment that he only took five threes [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2209.04s)]
*  But he takes the fourth most pull up threes per game in the nba. He took a terrible one with like four minutes left today [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2211.84s)]
*  Yeah, and it was like a 28 footer with with with like 22 seconds of the shot clock and I don't get it [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2219.28s)]
*  I don't know why he takes those shots because [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2225.28s)]
*  Last year he's south of 30 on those pull up threes [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2228.08s)]
*  He's 44 on catch and shoot threes and he can get to the free throw line for the month of december [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2231.04s)]
*  He's at like eight free throws per game. We know his finishing has been much better. He can post guys up [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2235.76s)]
*  He can score in isolation. Why do you take a step back three, especially when there's a center on you? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2240.7200000000003s)]
*  That's the one that I don't understand the most it's like here's the guy you can pull that guy out and go buy him [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2245.6s)]
*  He's 26 years old. He's not totally the player is going to be and even this year [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2250.1600000000003s)]
*  I feel like there's been some some good strides [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2254.48s)]
*  like him guarding shade today to me, it's like that's like a win and [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2257.36s)]
*  It's weird. They lose the game, but I felt pretty good about the about the loss and then [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2261.92s)]
*  If i'm okc [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2267.36s)]
*  I just beat minnesota and I beat denver and I beat boston [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2269.2000000000003s)]
*  And I beat boston in a game where boston fought back and it actually seemed like I might choke away the game and I executed [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2272.7200000000003s)]
*  Offense at the end of games. So now i'm thinking I can play with any of these teams. This is not a fluke because we're at the [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2278.88s)]
*  We're past the 30 game mark now like this is [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2285.12s)]
*  The rabbit stage of the season is over like the indiana going, you know 12 and 4 or whatever [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2288.3199999999997s)]
*  They're like that that shit's behind us now. We're starting to find out who are your flaws like minnesota is starting to feel [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2293.6s)]
*  You've seen a couple flaws now. It's like oh if mike conley sucks in a game, they have some issues [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2300.56s)]
*  um [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2305.44s)]
*  They this okc team's good [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2306.72s)]
*  I think this celtics team when you think seven losses and six of them [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2308.4s)]
*  Two plays go differently and they could have won all six like it's hard to be upset [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2312.4s)]
*  And the starting group, I believe they only have two what two losses together like this group that [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2317.04s)]
*  When they're actually all in the lineup, I believe this is only their second loss [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2322.56s)]
*  Altogether, but if you just look at it big picture wise like I don't see anything really milwaukee can do outside of like if dame [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2326.06s)]
*  Just goes crazy [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2332.7200000000003s)]
*  But on the other end like the celtics are going to be able to take advantage of liller now [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2333.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't think it's bad for them. Yeah [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2337.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, their defense is really bad like there's this thing that was going around social media where dames like looking at where the screen's [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2339.2s)]
*  Coming from and helle bern just goes right by him [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2344.48s)]
*  He's he's been and like the numbers for the past couple years have told you that lil are just horrible defensively billy [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2346.7999999999997s)]
*  That's a team where it's like, okay, they beat the shit out of the bulls tonight [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2352.72s)]
*  Maxie's playing outstanding. Of course, we know what they have in bead. Is there a move for them to make like well [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2356.72s)]
*  There is a move. It's just can they make it in time before like they lost out on in nobby [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2362.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's the one that would have scared me that yeah [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2367.12s)]
*  Yeah [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2369.6800000000003s)]
*  That one would have scared me just because I feel like okay [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2369.92s)]
*  That's a guy that they can throw on tatum and the dirty secret about philly is they've never had a guy to throw on tatum [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2372.0s)]
*  Like they were trying pj tuck remember they traded for what was his name mcdane was that mcdaniel's brother that played for philly last year [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2377.92s)]
*  No, but it was he was he was like the bad mcdaniels. He was like his second cousin [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2384.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, the guy that the guy that tatum when he was playing for charlotte put 50 on and that's the guy that i'll tell you [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2389.04s)]
*  If they keep morris and they have the baton coveted morris like that's at least better than what they had last year and morris does have the [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2394.24s)]
*  Big brother little brother thing with tatum. Maybe it won't matter anymore, but [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2402.24s)]
*  I assume they're gonna make a trade and i assume miami's gonna make a trade. They have lauras expiring and [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2406.24s)]
*  maybe they'll get into mitchell if [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2411.3599999999997s)]
*  Mitchell becomes available but miami's gonna do something [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2413.68s)]
*  The one the one thing that I feel better about with miami this year compared to last year and you're right [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2416.64s)]
*  They probably will make a move and maybe it's a big move. I mean who knows I I mean I wouldn't be trading for zac [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2420.88s)]
*  Levine, but if zac levine got traded they're not gonna do that [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2425.84s)]
*  Okay, so but I would say like if if he got traded to any team and I was worried about it [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2429.04s)]
*  It'd only be miami because they like somehow get the guy right, but the reason miami doesn't yeah [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2432.6400000000003s)]
*  You're right [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2436.96s)]
*  And i'm gonna hate to say this i'm not gonna would the reason they don't scare me as much as they have in the past [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2437.84s)]
*  Is like I feel like bam last year could just muck everything up because of the offensive personnel now [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2442.8s)]
*  If he's not on porzingis [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2450.48s)]
*  Then they have real trouble because then you can just give it to porzingis and he can score on the post [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2452.32s)]
*  So I think that bam's gonna have to cover porzingis [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2455.92s)]
*  In a potential playoff series and I I feel like that's sort of [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2458.8s)]
*  Going back to this whole theme of why they traded for him. I think that's the biggest difference going back to [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2462.1600000000003s)]
*  This season I agree to last year like that's the one guy they can't lose [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2467.1200000000003s)]
*  Like I think they could actually win a playoff series not the finals [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2469.76s)]
*  But they could win a playoff series without tatum or they could win a playoff series without [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2472.48s)]
*  Jaylen now not for the entire postseason run. I don't think they can win a championship that way [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2476.48s)]
*  But if they don't have porzingis for billy [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2480.48s)]
*  Milwaukee or the heat I think they're in trouble [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2483.5s)]
*  agree he's [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2486.72s)]
*  We've said it before he's the superpower of the team [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2488.24s)]
*  He's the guy that raises the ceiling you go from being a 10 story building to being a 20 story building [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2491.52s)]
*  Literally, I'll leave you with this [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2497.68s)]
*  the next couple games [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2500.3999999999996s)]
*  They're playing the jazz at home on friday [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2502.72s)]
*  And then they have this weird for some reason they're playing in indiana two more times, which I don't understand at all [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2505.76s)]
*  It's this baseball series stuff that they're doing the nba but we already played in indiana. So now this is somehow three indiana games [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2511.28s)]
*  Then home from minnesota [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2519.04s)]
*  At milwaukee [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2522.2400000000002s)]
*  And then home houston [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2524.0s)]
*  So those are that basically the next that's all in like the next uh, they have a break and then friday [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2525.84s)]
*  And then it's like five games in eight days something like that [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2531.04s)]
*  All of those teams bring something different to the table like utah's just a weird team [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2535.04s)]
*  They have these guards that attack the basket marketing stuff kessler protects the rim [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2539.44s)]
*  But they're it's they kind of ride whatever the hot hand is will hardy [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2544.32s)]
*  So and that's a classic terrible celtics letdown game where it's like wait, we're losing by 18 at home to utah. What's going on? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2548.6400000000003s)]
*  Then you have the pacer's team which is proven [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2556.1600000000003s)]
*  They're not afraid of the celtics and they'll go run and gun and you try to play our pace [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2558.32s)]
*  Timberwolves beat them already and had the mcdaniels edwards combo [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2563.2000000000003s)]
*  And then the rockets is eme coming back [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2567.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so and and with a team, you know shangoon. I think is going to be problematic for them [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2570.0800000000004s)]
*  But I think so that will be january 13th against all the playoff games, but [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2576.0s)]
*  after three those six games [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2582.0s)]
*  I think we'll have a really good feeling on what the ceiling of the celtics team is [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2586.32s)]
*  And I think that ceiling I think they're the best team in the league [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2590.2400000000002s)]
*  Them losing barely to okc today doesn't change that in my head. I thought it was a better win for okc but [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2593.44s)]
*  Um, but we'll see six games from now [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2598.48s)]
*  All right. Well two questions actually a comment and a question to the two things to what you laid out there [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2600.96s)]
*  Marketing that would scare me if he got traded to somebody in the east like about okc [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2606.0s)]
*  Or yeah, okay. So that's a great one [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2611.6000000000004s)]
*  I mean he's one of the best catch and shoot three-pointers in the shooters in the nba like what if philly got in on that [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2613.1200000000003s)]
*  That I just don't think he's available. I never believed that he was available to begin [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2618.72s)]
*  Why would you trade them? They have a million picks already. What do they need to trade him for true? [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2622.56s)]
*  And I mean, but I mean I will say like danny's like danny's got a lot out of the like think about the [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2626.8799999999997s)]
*  Care. Yeah [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2632.48s)]
*  Yeah, and if they're a couple years, obviously they're a couple years away. Maybe they go out and do that but [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2634.3199999999997s)]
*  The other interesting component is you see will hardy in the building as you mentioned with utah coming to town [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2638.96s)]
*  And I know they're not having a great season and then the eme thing [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2643.68s)]
*  So my question about the rockets coming back is your dad going to be okay like with eme in the building like [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2646.64s)]
*  Going up against second row joe [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2651.8399999999997s)]
*  My dad loves eme as you know, he's he's still upset [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2657.44s)]
*  He thought he may was it was I think it was maybe in the running for his favorite Celtic coach [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2660.64s)]
*  Joe's been growing on my dad a little bit this season [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2667.2s)]
*  He and I think charles lee has been a big piece of that because I think charles lee has been really important [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2670.24s)]
*  But just in general he's he he feels like he's seeing small strides in joe [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2675.44s)]
*  But we'll see he could turn on joe in five seconds as you know, um [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2681.76s)]
*  he [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2686.0s)]
*  He still feels like the three-point thing drives him nuts [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2687.04s)]
*  Even them losing today, but only shooting 43 is a huge win for my dad [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2691.84s)]
*  um [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2696.2400000000002s)]
*  The jacking up just a million threes he does he will never abide by that because [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2697.2000000000003s)]
*  My dad he's been in too many playoff games and he's just like here's what works in the playoffs [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2701.28s)]
*  And we know that doesn't work in the playoffs. We have you know, 20 years evidence now [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2705.76s)]
*  So he wants them to attack the rim and play smart like they did tonight [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2710.0s)]
*  So if they do that, he's happy but he does miss eme. He's going to be sad [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2713.68s)]
*  I do have faith now that when they get in a bind this year on the playoffs [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2718.08s)]
*  They're actually going to do the right thing and give it to poor zingas because I feel like we've seen it too many times [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2721.44s)]
*  It's the matchup. Yeah. Yeah, so I I do think that's a positive thing going can I ask you a question? [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2726.2400000000002s)]
*  Did you probably don't do a thank you email video i'm guessing [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2731.76s)]
*  I I don't think so. I don't think that's going to be available. It's going to be super awkward [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2736.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean they had they had a kelly olynyk and a kelly olynyk video like [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2743.92s)]
*  I don't think we're getting the thank you email video. It's going to be super weird though. There's no question [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2748.32s)]
*  Anyway, all right. Well, I wish we were doing this after a win, but it was good to see regardless [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2752.6400000000003s)]
*  No doubt about it [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2757.52s)]
*  You [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nLXmM3a0Vw&t=2761.36s)]
