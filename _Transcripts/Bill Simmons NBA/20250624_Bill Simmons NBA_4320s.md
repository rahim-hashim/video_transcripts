# The Celtics Blow It Up and More Predraft Story Lines | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs)
*  Alright, it's been a while. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=0.0s)]
*  Chris Mannix is here. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=27.04s)]
*  We're taping this little after 4 30 Pacific time in the afternoon. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=28.08s)]
*  It's kind of waiting for stuff to happen today. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=32.6s)]
*  We had the drew holiday trade last night and then Chris have sports. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=35.4s)]
*  Angus sent that Lena today. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=39.0s)]
*  Chris Mannix, the 2024 Celtics funeral is here. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=41.16s)]
*  They lopped off miraculously. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  $28 million in two trades. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=49.0s)]
*  They got under the second apron, which doesn't just save them almost 200 million in luxury [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  tax, but also has all these other positive roster benefits. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=56.52s)]
*  There still might be another trade because I think both of us feel like there might be [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=60.52s)]
*  a Sam Hauser something. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=63.52s)]
*  They want to bring back Luke Cornett. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=66.52000000000001s)]
*  They want to potentially bring back Al Horford. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=68.28s)]
*  So there's some other stuff happening. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=70.56s)]
*  But did you think it was going to be this simple for the Celtics to cut that much money [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=72.82000000000001s)]
*  when you have to take contracts back in trades and somehow Simon's $5 million less than a [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  true holiday and then the hang is 22 million less than poor Zingas. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=86.12s)]
*  This was a borderline miracle. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=89.8s)]
*  I thought they made some great deals and I thought they found the exact right partners [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=92.44s)]
*  to deal with. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  Like you might think like, hey, what is Portland the true holiday for? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  Like they're not good, but Portland is trying to build this defensive identity and Portland [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=106.04s)]
*  clearly had no interest in giving Anfery Simons any kind of money after this season. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=111.64s)]
*  They did that once. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=117.56s)]
*  They weren't going to do it again. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=118.56s)]
*  So really what the Blazers are doing with holidays, taking the two years left on his [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=119.72s)]
*  deal, getting him on a basically a three year deal for a guy like that. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=125.4s)]
*  They can live with that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=128.68s)]
*  And look, the Celtics can just take this flyer on Simon's, let him shoot 500 threes next [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=130.8s)]
*  year and walk away from him. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=135.56s)]
*  Maybe he shows them something. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  Maybe he wants to be there. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=139.68s)]
*  But they can just walk away from that. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=140.88s)]
*  Atlanta, they're another perfect partner. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=142.72s)]
*  They were looking to do, they didn't really want to just blow the whole thing up and trade [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=145.28s)]
*  away Trey and reboot that whole thing. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=150.32s)]
*  I never got the vibe from them that that was kind of what they were looking for over the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=152.8s)]
*  last few weeks. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=157.24s)]
*  You know, poor Zingas at his best looks like a really good fit playing opposite Trey Young. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=158.24s)]
*  And like contract year Chris Des, poor Zingas is going to ball out. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=164.8s)]
*  The last time we saw contract year ish, poor Zingas was in Washington and he put up huge [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=170.0s)]
*  numbers there. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=174.16s)]
*  I think you're going to get the very best of Chris Des, poor Zingas. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=175.16s)]
*  So the circumstances suck. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=178.51999999999998s)]
*  The Celtics are not going to be good next year. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=181.67999999999998s)]
*  Probably be lucky to fight for, I mean, I guess the Eastern Conference, I think it's [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=184.16s)]
*  possible, but they're probably a play in type of team. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  But I thought they did really well given the circumstances because they found the two teams [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=190.04s)]
*  out there that needed exactly what they had. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=195.67999999999998s)]
*  Well, I'm going to reach into my zag bag. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=198.95999999999998s)]
*  I have multiple zags for everything you just said. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=203.56s)]
*  First of all, I'm not sure the Celtics are going to be that bad next year in this weird [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=205.72s)]
*  Eastern Conference. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=210.04s)]
*  Is it, am I just, is it the Celtics fan side of me just kicking in? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  I was looking at the roster and I'm like, man, holiday in the, in the playoffs and in [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=216.44s)]
*  the Knicks areas, I thought like pretty rough. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  That was a team that I think four years ago, I was talking to, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=225.44s)]
*  my dad about this history because my dad was visiting. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  We were like four years ago, holiday against Brunson, holiday guarding towns. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=230.84s)]
*  You could have thrown holiday on basically any Nick and he would have been hugely [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=236.56s)]
*  impactful and he just wasn't in the Knicks series. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=241.4s)]
*  I was a little nervous about him going, going forward. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=243.96s)]
*  You flip him into Simons who fills this scoring board that they clearly need with Tatum, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=247.44s)]
*  who I think, you know, Portland was pretty good down the stretch last year and he [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=252.12s)]
*  wasn't not a piece of that, you know? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=256.68s)]
*  So, um, I just, I'm not willing to go play in yet with them. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=258.8s)]
*  I don't think they're wired that way. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=265.04s)]
*  You have a new owner. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=266.8s)]
*  I don't think he's going to be like, cool, let's go 35 and 47. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=268.24s)]
*  Like you don't think Jaylen Brown is going to be going, Hey, look at, look at the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  East Indiana is now with this Halberd situation. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=275.76s)]
*  Nick's new coach, who knows? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=280.44s)]
*  Like you go on through and maybe Jaylen Brown's like, this is my time now. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=281.92s)]
*  I can carry us. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=286.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=287.96s)]
*  I'm not, I'm, I think all bets are off with the 2025 26 Celtics, including more [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=288.4s)]
*  trades and them just gutting shit. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=293.48s)]
*  So what, let's dig into that a little bit. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=295.44s)]
*  Like I love the lens that Brad Stevens is viewing this through. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  Like, like you might be right. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=300.92s)]
*  Like Jaylen Brown is probably a lock for an all NBA team, assuming he meets the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=302.0s)]
*  criteria next year, he's, I think he's going to be great. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=306.32s)]
*  Um, you know, Simon's is going to score. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=309.16s)]
*  Like they've got dark white, it's going to be dark white. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=311.24s)]
*  They've got pieces there. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=313.0s)]
*  But they're not a championship team. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=314.24s)]
*  Like both get on board. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  Like, so I think with the Celtics probably look at it and are saying like, all [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=319.4s)]
*  right, we can, you know, bring the band back, um, pay the luxury tax penalties. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=322.64s)]
*  Uh, maybe, maybe slide under the second apron, who knows whatever they may do. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=329.48s)]
*  And are we going to be happy with like this second round playoff exit? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=333.92s)]
*  Like, is that a victory for them? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=337.4s)]
*  Like to me, this is all setting up an aggressive summer and summer of the 20, 20 [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=338.71999999999997s)]
*  26, when they can lose these repeater tax penalties, they can be under, uh, the [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=343.24s)]
*  second apron, maybe even under the first day apron, if they make a, uh, a few deals. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=348.0s)]
*  I think they're setting themselves up for that 26, 27 season. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=352.76s)]
*  Well, you can't hit that. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=355.64s)]
*  You can't hit that point hard enough though, because it's not just the money. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=356.56s)]
*  It's all this weird roster shit that comes with being over the second [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=360.8s)]
*  apron and being a repeater. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=364.04s)]
*  Like it actually really does hurt your roster for multiple years. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  And you have to get under it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=369.24s)]
*  So they did. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=370.64s)]
*  They did. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=372.48s)]
*  I, I applaud them for that. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=373.16s)]
*  Like I don't, I don't care about a second, like making the playoffs as a four seed [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=374.84000000000003s)]
*  and being feisty against the Knicks in the second round. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=380.44s)]
*  I don't care about that. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=382.68s)]
*  I don't think Brad Stevens cares about that either. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=383.68s)]
*  Like this, this to me, all these deals scream, like, let's just get through next [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=385.96000000000004s)]
*  year, let's take the gap year and then let's have flexibility. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=390.04s)]
*  Like we can go into 26, 27 with still arguably one of the top five two man [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=393.16s)]
*  duos in the NBA in Tatum and Brown. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=398.04s)]
*  Like that can be the court. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=400.28000000000003s)]
*  Derek white is still under contract. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=401.16s)]
*  He can be part of the core. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=403.08000000000004s)]
*  Like they, they're giving themselves room to operate in the summer of 2026. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=404.12s)]
*  And all they're doing really is sacrificing, you know, whatever next [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=408.56s)]
*  year is going to look like. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=412.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, look, I did think Porzingis was kind of interesting to move off him. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=413.68s)]
*  To him to be the first guy or one of the first guys you move off because [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=418.0s)]
*  he loves it in Boston. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=422.0s)]
*  He loves his role in Boston. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=423.28000000000003s)]
*  It was playing there, everything about being a Celtic. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=424.52000000000004s)]
*  Like, could you have convinced Porzingis next summer to sign for a lesser number? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=427.0s)]
*  Maybe, maybe to be part of what they were doing there. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=432.12s)]
*  Maybe you could have convinced them. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=434.59999999999997s)]
*  Maybe you can still convince them to do that. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=435.88s)]
*  If you have some room to operate. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=437.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=439.36s)]
*  In the summer. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=439.71999999999997s)]
*  How do we know he's not just moving to Atlanta for nine months and coming back? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=440.08s)]
*  He might, or he can sign with the wizards again for the gargantuan amount of [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=443.88s)]
*  cap space they're accruing. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=447.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=450.44s)]
*  So that was kind of interesting to me that they, that they moved off him as [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=451.88s)]
*  quickly as they did, but everything else, like I get it, like this, there'll be a [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=456.59999999999997s)]
*  feisty fun team next year. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=460.28s)]
*  I think Simon's going to have some great moments at team. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=461.88s)]
*  Like he's, he's going to put up like 40 point games at some point with them. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=464.44s)]
*  But they're not going to be good. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=468.35999999999996s)]
*  I can't wait to talk about Simon's. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=469.24s)]

*  availability and the eligibility vary by state. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=497.28s)]
*  So you said something interesting there. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=500.76s)]
*  You said this allows them to be really aggressive in the summer of 2026. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=502.28s)]
*  I don't disagree. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=508.08s)]
*  What if it allows them to be really aggressive in January or February of [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=510.4s)]
*  2026, because the hidden piece of this. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=513.88s)]
*  Now they have Niang who's, I think he's expiring after this year. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=517.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=520.6s)]
*  And then Simon's same thing. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=521.56s)]
*  You put those together. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=523.6s)]
*  I'm at 35 million with those two guys. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=525.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=527.84s)]
*  I am now in the mix in a bunch of different ways now. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=528.1999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=532.04s)]
*  What if the Celtics are better than they thought? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=532.4399999999999s)]
*  What if Tatum's rehab is way ahead and they feel like he can come back and [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=534.72s)]
*  mark it like, I just think they wanted malleability with the roster and with [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=539.28s)]
*  Drew, which, you know, I, if you do the on paper thing with the Drew Simon's [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=543.72s)]
*  trade, you'd be like, Whoa, Boston got a younger player and an expiring whose [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=549.76s)]
*  arrows still may be pointing up a tiny bit. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=554.4s)]
*  Drew's arrow pointed down. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=556.6s)]
*  That's not why Portland did the deal. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=557.92s)]
*  I mean, Drew is like, you saw it. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=559.48s)]
*  Um, and you were, you were covering this house a little bit last year. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=561.72s)]
*  Like the Drew is like one of the most beloved behind the scenes teammates. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=564.76s)]
*  Um, in Milwaukee in, in, uh, in Boston, like just, he was in Boston for two years. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=568.8399999999999s)]
*  And I think he goes down him and Horford, I think are going to go down as hall of [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=575.28s)]
*  fame, just everybody in the organization raving about people as people. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=579.4399999999999s)]
*  If you're in Portland, you have this defensive identity you're building, but [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=583.4399999999999s)]
*  more importantly, you're bringing in like an adult, an awesome guy, a role model, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=586.8s)]
*  a leader, like just everything you're looking for, if you're a younger team. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=592.12s)]
*  And you have to factor that in with the trade. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=596.12s)]
*  Even if he was slipping a little bit last year, the stuff he brings, like [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=598.0s)]
*  think about Horford just the last few years of his career, where it's like, I [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=601.72s)]
*  don't know, he's now almost 40 still doing it like holiday might be able to be [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=605.96s)]
*  that guy for three, four more years, but it's the off the court stuff that I think. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=610.52s)]
*  You know, they that's just, you need that shit. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=616.12s)]
*  Nobody's signing to go play in Portland. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=618.4s)]
*  So anyway, I really liked that trade for both teams. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=620.4s)]
*  You mentioned the Simon's piece, like, and obviously the West coast [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=623.56s)]
*  league pass I've watched my share of Portland. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=627.24s)]
*  I have a lot of scoot Henderson stock. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=629.8s)]
*  Simon's will just go nuts. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=631.76s)]
*  You have a lot of scoot Henderson stock. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=633.16s)]
*  Me and Rosilla, we have most of it. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=634.76s)]
*  We cornered the market. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=636.44s)]
*  I respected, I respected your knee Smith Island stock. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=637.88s)]
*  I don't know if we have that. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=640.6800000000001s)]
*  We bought it. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=641.6s)]
*  I don't know if I'm there. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=642.12s)]
*  I invested in Ken Whitmore, Alan. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=642.6800000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=644.4s)]
*  Um, but Simon's will just get super hot. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=644.6800000000001s)]
*  And you look at this, this is why I was talking back before about like, I don't [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=647.96s)]
*  know if the Celtics are gonna be that bad. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=651.96s)]
*  You've Pritchard and Simon's out there. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=654.12s)]
*  Those are like two of the better heat check guards in the league. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=655.8s)]
*  You have Jaylen who's still a top 20 guy. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=658.4799999999999s)]
*  You might have rebounding. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=660.88s)]
*  You're going to have a good coach. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=662.04s)]
*  You have this philosophy of just gunning up threes. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=663.0s)]
*  They're going to be way worse defensively. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=666.12s)]
*  Poor Zingas played half the year last year and then was a, you know, a corpse [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=668.04s)]
*  in the playoffs because he wasn't healthy. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=671.7199999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=674.12s)]
*  Like, I don't know how much worse the Tatum piece is the piece. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=674.9599999999999s)]
*  That's the disaster. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=678.28s)]
*  But if you're talking about the rest of it, like they might be all right. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=679.3199999999999s)]
*  They might be an overachiever. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=682.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=683.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm prepared for anything. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=683.8399999999999s)]
*  I'm prepared for a top five team potentially if everybody stays healthy and [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=685.12s)]
*  everything goes right for them. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=691.0400000000001s)]
*  But again, that doesn't, it doesn't get you anywhere. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=692.84s)]
*  Like the, what I like to, but the thing is can they be fun though? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=695.64s)]
*  I think is what matters. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=699.6s)]
*  Cause if you're doing basically a gap year and you're resetting it, you can't, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=700.72s)]
*  you have the Celtics run where the fans have just watched a really awesome team [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=704.96s)]
*  for eight years in a row and you can't just like, yep, we don't care about this [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=708.24s)]
*  year. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=711.76s)]
*  Like I still feel like they care a little bit about this year, right? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=711.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=716.64s)]
*  Not to win a title, but just to be entertaining. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=717.4399999999999s)]
*  I think we're looking at it. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=720.16s)]
*  We're kind of, we kind of, you and I care about two different things. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=720.9599999999999s)]
*  One, well you care more than I do about them being fun next year. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=723.3199999999999s)]
*  Like I don't care. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=727.12s)]
*  Fun and malleable are the two words I would use. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=727.88s)]
*  I want them to have malleable roster and actually not be a disaster. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=729.9599999999999s)]
*  Malleable is fine. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=733.9599999999999s)]
*  I mean, they're not, with Jalen Brown and the talent they have, they're never [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=734.92s)]
*  going to be a disaster. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=737.28s)]
*  And the conference that they're in that gets weaker by literally the day with [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=738.04s)]
*  the Halliburton injury. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=741.6s)]
*  Like it's going to be impossible for them not to compete. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=742.9200000000001s)]
*  Although, you know, God knows what the wizards look like. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=746.7600000000001s)]
*  They might be actually be better next year. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=748.5200000000001s)]
*  I just, I, I just don't, I don't care. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=752.4000000000001s)]
*  Like I, I think what I know what Brad's doing is saying like, look, Tatum put [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=754.6s)]
*  whatever timeline you want on him. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=760.44s)]
*  But I'm skeptical Tatum comes back at all. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=762.5600000000001s)]
*  Like I don't see the point to it. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=764.5600000000001s)]
*  Like there's no way people say in like eight, nine months, like what, in what [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=765.8000000000001s)]
*  world? Like why, why would you drop him back into the lineup post all star break [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=768.3199999999999s)]
*  when you might be in a playoff race? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=773.04s)]
*  That's just a recipe for disaster. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=774.36s)]
*  That makes no sense. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=775.64s)]
*  Like they, they have their pick in 2026. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=776.4399999999999s)]
*  Like that has to be factored in. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=779.28s)]
*  Chris, don't ruin this for me. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=780.4s)]
*  I'm just saying, man, like they've got their pick in 2026. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=781.88s)]
*  Let them, I mean, Boston fans can accept a gap year where they stink out the [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=784.8399999999999s)]
*  joint, maybe even wind up with a lottery pick if they're really, if they go the [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=790.4s)]
*  other way and are really bad. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=793.4399999999999s)]
*  And all of a sudden in the summer of 2026, you got Tatum coming back. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=794.8399999999999s)]
*  You've got Brown still there. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=798.64s)]
*  You've got white still there. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=800.0s)]
*  You've got the genius of Brad Stevens. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=801.4399999999999s)]
*  And I, we, I think he's, he's really good at this job. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=803.1999999999999s)]
*  He was a really good coach and he's also a really good general manager. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=806.16s)]
*  You've got that all in play to shake up the roster one more time in the summer [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=809.16s)]
*  of 2026. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=813.4s)]
*  I, I, I'm fine with that. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=814.28s)]
*  I don't care if they win 30 games next year. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=815.8s)]
*  I really don't. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=817.88s)]
*  I think that's certainly exercise then Chris Mannix. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=818.5999999999999s)]
*  Here's a Celtics team that's going to have Jalen Brown, Derek White, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=822.68s)]
*  Peyton Pritchard, Inferney Simons, Niang. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=827.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to throw in Horford and Cornett. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=830.8s)]
*  Little, little Kada. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=834.0s)]
*  Hold on, hold on. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=835.28s)]
*  You, you think Horford's back? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=835.9599999999999s)]
*  I do. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=838.28s)]
*  I think he finishes his career in Boston. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=838.64s)]
*  I think it's hit that point with him. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=840.8s)]
*  Why are you skeptical? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=842.16s)]
*  I think, I think the market could be really interesting for Horford. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=842.88s)]
*  If he, look, maybe he wants the stags. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=845.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=847.4s)]
*  He's made $300 billion. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=848.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm with you. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=850.3199999999999s)]
*  But when I, you know, in the last few weeks, whenever I have off season [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=850.8s)]
*  conversations with, with GMs, like a lot of it's like Al Horford would fit great [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=853.88s)]
*  there, like the Knicks get bounced out. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=858.12s)]
*  Well, Al Horford would fit pretty good in New York. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=859.7199999999999s)]
*  San Antonio sitting down there with Webb Benyama. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=862.24s)]
*  Wouldn't you love to have a guy like Al Horford in your rotation as well? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=864.28s)]
*  This is probably like a third of the league, given what Al still has left and [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=867.16s)]
*  what Al's salary demands are going to be that theoretically would be interested. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=871.9599999999999s)]
*  So you're saying like the mid level, like the 7 million or even higher? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=876.3599999999999s)]
*  Higher, maybe 10, 12. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=880.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=881.6s)]
*  Like what'd he make 10 last year? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=882.0s)]
*  Two years, 20 was his last contract. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=883.36s)]
*  I could see him in play. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=885.48s)]
*  Like, yeah, I am deep, deep down. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=886.92s)]
*  You're triggering me now because I'm deep down. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=888.84s)]
*  I am a little worried about this because the team I'm worried about is the Lakers. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=890.84s)]
*  That's like an obvious, obvious Al Horford fit where they could just kind of grab him. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=896.0s)]
*  I mean, there's some other ones, but I don't know. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=902.28s)]
*  He won a title in Boston. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=904.68s)]
*  He's beloved in Boston. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=906.0s)]
*  And it's like, you don't, he doesn't have to chase a ring because he won a ring. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=907.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=910.8000000000001s)]
*  And if you're talking about difference between they could pay him two and a half [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=911.08s)]
*  million versus whatever it is, like, you know, uproot, I don't know. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=914.04s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=918.04s)]
*  But, um, I don't think the team's going to be, I don't know, let's go through. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=918.64s)]
*  I'm going to read you everybody in the East and you tell me what teams are [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=925.12s)]
*  definitively better than the Celtics next year would say they're no more [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=929.16s)]
*  trades and they keep housing. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=932.48s)]
*  So we would say Cleveland. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=933.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=935.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=935.6800000000001s)]
*  Cleveland. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=935.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=936.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=937.12s)]
*  We would say the Knicks. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=938.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=939.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=941.0s)]
*  And Orlando. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=942.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=942.76s)]
*  Love the Orlando trade. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=944.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=945.1999999999999s)]
*  Those three, I think we can both agree. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=945.8s)]
*  Have better rosters and a chance for regular season success [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=949.88s)]
*  than the Celtics next year. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=952.9599999999999s)]
*  I would agree. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=954.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=955.3199999999999s)]
*  Detroit. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=956.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=958.8399999999999s)]
*  I think I would agree. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=959.9599999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=960.92s)]
*  So there's four. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=961.12s)]
*  Then you, you, you all of a sudden I'm in Indiana with no Hal Burton, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=962.24s)]
*  Giannis with no teammates, um, Miami. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=966.48s)]
*  I don't even know what they're trying to do. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=969.76s)]
*  The Hawks might be the biggest threat for the five seed out of anybody. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=972.08s)]
*  We're listing Toronto. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=976.88s)]
*  Give me a break. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=978.08s)]
*  Philadelphia. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=978.8s)]
*  I have no idea how many in bead games I'm getting. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=979.64s)]
*  Um, I feel like the five seed is, is wide open in the East, which is more [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=981.92s)]
*  of reflection of how, how, uh, gutted the East is. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=988.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=990.64s)]
*  And I look at Philly and we'll see what happens on draft night. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=991.1999999999999s)]
*  I think there's a lot of potential moves in play in the next 24 hours for Philadelphia. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=994.48s)]
*  Um, if M beads healthy, they're better than Boston. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1000.0799999999999s)]
*  Um, Atlanta, if Porzingis can give you an if it beats healthy, I'm just saying [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1004.12s)]
*  I'm giving, I'm giving, I'm giving them better for the doubt here on this one. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1008.68s)]
*  I mean, if it beats healthy, they're better. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1013.0799999999999s)]
*  Atlanta, if Porzingis gives us 65 plus games, they're better than Boston. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1014.92s)]
*  So we're kind of in that same range there where I could see them [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1018.72s)]
*  anywhere from like eight to five. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1021.72s)]
*  So they're getting Porzingis and Jaylen Johnson back. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1023.48s)]
*  I love Jaylen Johnson. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1027.72s)]
*  I want all the stock on Jaylen Johnson. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1028.92s)]
*  If you and I were the Atlanta Conciliar is I would be like, fucking go for it, man. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1031.72s)]
*  You still have to go for it. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1037.68s)]
*  You still have to go for it. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1038.84s)]
*  You still have to go for it. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1039.72s)]
*  You still have to go for it. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1040.52s)]
*  You still have to go for it. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1041.32s)]
*  You still have to go for it. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1042.12s)]
*  You still have to go for it. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1042.96s)]
*  You still have a $25 million trade exception that expires on July 7th. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1043.8s)]
*  Like go for it. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1048.6399999999999s)]
*  Go get Norman Powell from the Clippers. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1050.68s)]
*  Like, let's go. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1052.72s)]
*  Like go get, go get a real player who can play in a playoff series. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1053.52s)]
*  Um, you got Jaylen Johnson coming back. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1057.68s)]
*  So it's almost like you're signing a free agent. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1059.56s)]
*  Reese's Shea is a year older. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1061.76s)]
*  You have Porzingis basically replacing Capella, but you also have a Kong Wu. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1063.8s)]
*  I like their team. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1068.04s)]
*  I liked their team last year. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1068.9199999999998s)]
*  I felt like if Jaylen Johnson didn't get hurt last year, I thought that would [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1070.08s)]
*  have been a really interesting round one team. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1073.16s)]
*  I think Jaylen Johnson, Jaylen Johnson to me is one of, and amongst NBA people, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1075.3600000000001s)]
*  he's not underrated, but like publicly he's criminally underrated. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1080.28s)]
*  Like every time I watch that guy play on TV or in person, he is outstanding. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1082.92s)]
*  And you know, if he's healthy, he's going to be an all star next year. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1087.16s)]
*  Um, yeah, I mean, Porzingis, Johnson, Trey, not a ton of defense with that group. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1090.92s)]
*  Um, but I, with that $25 million exception, I think going forward is the right [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1098.1200000000001s)]
*  play and I think that's their mindset too. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1103.88s)]
*  Like the Porzingis trade to me signals that Atlanta is going to try in this [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1105.16s)]
*  conference or the right thing to do, given what's sitting up at the top. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1110.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, they also have the 13th pick in the draft that they got from Sacramento. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1114.5600000000002s)]
*  So they still have the possibility of maybe there's one more move where they [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1118.6000000000001s)]
*  move backwards and pick up a veteran. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1123.0s)]
*  I tried to talk myself into Atlanta saying yes to Hauser and the 28th for the [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1125.8799999999999s)]
*  number 13th, but I don't think that's enough, but I love Sam Hauser and I [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1129.8s)]
*  actually think that would be a good trade for Atlanta. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1134.8799999999999s)]
*  So maybe consider that one Atlanta. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1136.52s)]
*  The market is robust right now for Sam Hauser from what I've heard. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1138.36s)]
*  I mean, he's starting that four year 45 million. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1142.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1144.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1145.12s)]
*  I mean, he's, he's, he's a 40 plus percent three point shooter who's been on a [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1145.36s)]
*  championship team, who's got a very manageable contract. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1148.8799999999999s)]
*  Like there's a lot of teams that could use guys like that. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1150.96s)]
*  And I don't know if Baylor Shireman is Sam Hauser 2.0 or can replicate anything [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1153.84s)]
*  he does, but I know he's a lot cheaper. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1158.4s)]
*  And I think that's going to be the priority for the Celtics with that [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1160.04s)]
*  particular spot in the lineup. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1163.76s)]
*  I feel like you might get aggregated on Hoopsight now. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1165.68s)]
*  Manix Hauser, trademark it robust. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1169.32s)]
*  A hot take though. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1174.08s)]
*  It feels like a very lukewarm take that the 26 year old elite three point [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1174.96s)]
*  shooter, maybe can't guard that many guys, but can make a show. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1180.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1183.6399999999999s)]
*  Shot at 40% from three. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1183.8s)]
*  That's [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1185.32s)]
*  well, and it's Priscilla always says like the sneakiest. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1186.12s)]
*  Wait, haven't you watched tape? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1189.9199999999998s)]
*  Stop thinking you can challenge him and post up dudes. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1191.48s)]
*  Cause he's actually like a half decent defender and one on one on an island. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1194.9199999999998s)]
*  He's actually okay. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1199.1599999999999s)]
*  I think the Pistons make a lot of sense for him and I'm, I'm interested to see [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1200.56s)]
*  what they do because that's, you know, where we talk about the wide open East. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1203.8s)]
*  If I'm the Pistons, I'm really looking at, Hey, we might be one move. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1208.48s)]
*  I would've, I would've kicked the tires hard on Durant. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1213.8s)]
*  We talked about that the other day on this podcast. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1216.24s)]
*  Like I just would've, I have Cade who's one of the best 15 guys in the league. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1218.48s)]
*  I have a young team. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1223.1200000000001s)]
*  Um, I have an identity, like what can I improve that to bias hair [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1224.6000000000001s)]
*  spot and go up a level? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1228.76s)]
*  Um, yeah, from a Celtic standpoint, the Jalen part will be really fun. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1231.0800000000002s)]
*  Um, the, the Prichard Simons together as a bat, like the Prichard [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1236.0800000000002s)]
*  Simons, Derek White, I don't know. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1242.76s)]
*  I'm in on it. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1245.04s)]
*  I can't believe they're able to pull out those two trades. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1245.64s)]
*  I thought Port Zingas was going to be impossible. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1248.04s)]
*  Just, I just thought they were going to have to take a giant contract back. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1250.76s)]
*  Cause he's making 30. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1254.0s)]
*  Like they needed, they basically needed the nets to be involved somehow. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1255.56s)]
*  And then the nets were like, Whoa, Terrence man and another pick. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1259.1200000000001s)]
*  We already have four. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1262.0800000000002s)]
*  All right, cool. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1263.0s)]
*  So let me ask you this. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1264.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1266.2s)]
*  What do you think the nets are up to here? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1266.52s)]
*  Because they're not accruing all these draft picks to just draft guys. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1268.96s)]
*  Like that's when, when, when I was at the draft lottery, talking to people in [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1273.16s)]
*  Brooklyn and people that talked to Brooklyn, the most deflated team not to [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1279.8s)]
*  move up was the Brooklyn Nets because the Brooklyn Nets believe that a top four [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1283.48s)]
*  pick was going to put them in play for one of the bigger names out there. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1287.84s)]
*  Obviously Yanis was at the very top of their list. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1292.04s)]
*  No idea if Yanis what's going to happen or how that's going to play out the [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1295.56s)]
*  next few weeks, but all I know is that the Nets acquiring one sixth of. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1298.12s)]
*  Thursday's draft is not so they can draft five guys. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1303.48s)]
*  Like that's just not, that's not what Sean Marks is looking to do here. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1307.48s)]
*  I'm very curious to see what the next 24 hours look like for Brooklyn. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1310.76s)]
*  If they, if they have something else in mind or another deal in [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1315.36s)]
*  mind to, to use these picks for. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1318.36s)]
*  Well, we think San Antonio is staying at two with Harper. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1320.8s)]
*  I think that's locked in Philly. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1323.72s)]
*  I'm prepared for literally anything. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1326.0s)]
*  You could give me any scenario and I would sign up for it. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1327.52s)]
*  So if you told me Darrell feels like I have, my model says we should take Ace [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1330.28s)]
*  Bailey, we don't even need to take it. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1334.96s)]
*  Take them at three. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1336.2s)]
*  He's going to be there at seven. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1336.8s)]
*  We'll trade back with Brooklyn or trade back to eight. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1337.84s)]
*  He's still going to be there at eight and we'll pick up all these other picks. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1341.1200000000001s)]
*  And then I'll do weird Darrell stuff with them. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1344.08s)]
*  You can talk me into that. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1346.88s)]
*  Um, you could talk me into anything with Charlotte because I don't think. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1348.32s)]
*  Can I throw something about Charlotte? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1353.6799999999998s)]
*  So Charlotte, so this Ace Bailey thing is wild. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1354.9199999999998s)]
*  Like Ace Bailey kind of being navigated by an agent that doesn't have a ton of [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1358.12s)]
*  experience, uh, not working out for anybody. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1363.1999999999998s)]
*  Um, like I think Mike, my theory on this on Ace Bailey is that right or wrong. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1366.0s)]
*  Here, here is team believe there's a team out there that he wants to go to. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1373.76s)]
*  That is going to trade up with Charlotte. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1378.8s)]
*  Like he's not working out for Philadelphia. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1380.56s)]
*  There's gotta be a reason for that. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1382.0s)]
*  He's not, he's not going to Utah. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1383.28s)]
*  Uh, I don't think he wants to go to Charlotte. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1385.6s)]
*  I think that Ace Bailey thinks that there's a team that's going to leap up, get [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1388.0s)]
*  that Charlotte pick and he wants to play there. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1392.92s)]
*  That's my theory on Ace Bailey. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1394.48s)]
*  That my team, like the Brooklyn nets. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1395.68s)]
*  Maybe, maybe. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1398.36s)]
*  So Charlotte moves back four spots. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1400.28s)]
*  They pick up a bunch of extra assets. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1403.28s)]
*  Which they need more than that fourth pick, I would argue. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1405.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1409.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1411.08s)]
*  Cause especially if, if edge comb goes third, which I think is the guy Charlotte [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1411.32s)]
*  wants, um, trying to decode, although what's bullshit, but what's actually real. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1416.3999999999999s)]
*  And it really does seem like that's the guy they want. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1420.76s)]
*  Um, and maybe they, they're like, fuck it. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1423.36s)]
*  Then we'll move back. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1425.56s)]
*  Um, for Brooklyn, I feel like Ace Bailey is going to drop to eight and I wouldn't [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1427.0s)]
*  trade up to get them because I think, I think when you put the stink out like that, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1431.88s)]
*  we saw it work with SAR last year. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1435.96s)]
*  Like SAR did this to Atlanta. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1438.1200000000001s)]
*  It's like, um, Nope, not even going. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1440.0400000000002s)]
*  If you take, if you take me buyer, but where this does work, when you have a [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1442.8000000000002s)]
*  pick that high and you have, usually if you're picking that high, your team's [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1447.2s)]
*  probably a mess to begin with. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1450.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1452.0400000000002s)]
*  And it's like, Oh, so who'd you take with this prime lottery pick? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1453.0800000000002s)]
*  We took the guy who literally wouldn't fly to come work out with us who refuses [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1457.8400000000001s)]
*  to take our calls and won't send us his medical records until the league [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1462.48s)]
*  mandated that he had to, that's our first pick high fives everybody. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1466.3200000000002s)]
*  Like nobody wants to do that. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1470.92s)]
*  So this actually works. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1472.64s)]
*  I think it's, it's smart, but on the other hand, it's possible that [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1473.88s)]
*  Ace Bailey is just a train wreck. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1477.68s)]
*  The stuff for the representation is pretty alarming. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1480.0400000000002s)]
*  Like there's, and there's a lot of stories that have been, I think being [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1482.5600000000002s)]
*  passed around and people aren't really talking about them publicly, but there's [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1486.36s)]
*  just, it just seems like a train wreck. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1490.28s)]
*  It, it's not like this is being, it's not like this is being orchestrated [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1492.8799999999999s)]
*  by like a Bill Duffy or rich Paul. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1498.7199999999998s)]
*  Like here I'm doing the chess board here. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1503.04s)]
*  It doesn't feel like chess board type stuff. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1505.8799999999999s)]
*  It's checkers. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1510.12s)]
*  What board game would you do? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1511.36s)]
*  Shoots and ladders. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1513.4399999999998s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1514.32s)]
*  Like whatever. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1514.6399999999999s)]
*  I mean, it just, it just feels very, very, very uneasy. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1515.6s)]
*  The only thing I can think of though, is that they, somebody's trying to get to four [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1521.08s)]
*  and they like the team that's trying to get to four that goes again. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1524.92s)]
*  I think if he's at eight, Brooklyn's going to take him. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1528.0s)]
*  Like all the stuff that's going on with Ace Bailey, he's a shop maker. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1530.04s)]
*  Like, I don't know if he flames out, he doesn't have the mindset for it or the [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1534.92s)]
*  complete skillset to become a great player, but that guy can get you a bucket. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1539.2s)]
*  Like that's why those weird Durant comparisons, I can kind of see it. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1542.3999999999999s)]
*  I can kind of see shades of it. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1546.92s)]
*  And if he's sitting there at eight, I think Brooklyn's going to take him. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1548.72s)]
*  I also don't think he gets past Washington. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1551.84s)]
*  I think Washington would take a flyer on a guy like that, with a high upside at number six. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1553.52s)]
*  So I think if at four is when this, well, three, it's going to get interesting. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1559.28s)]
*  Cause I don't know what Philadelphia is going to do either, but I think at four, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1562.92s)]
*  it gets real interesting with respect to Ace Bailey. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1565.6399999999999s)]
*  If Washington doesn't take them at six, I'm going to be disappointed. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1567.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1572.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't know if it's the right pick for them. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1572.72s)]
*  And it seems like the kind of guy they've type of, of, of kind of polarizing [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1574.92s)]
*  poor they've had in the past where it's usually like, Oh man, that didn't work out. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1579.8000000000002s)]
*  Brooklyn makes the most sense if that's his end game, but, uh, I think this is a great draft. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1584.3200000000002s)]
*  I've really enjoyed it. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1591.6000000000001s)]
*  I've enjoyed doing the research for it. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1592.5600000000002s)]
*  I think it's really unpredictable. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1594.3200000000002s)]
*  You have Cooper at the top. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1596.12s)]
*  It's so funny. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1598.24s)]
*  Like he goes and works out for Dallas and, and then the stories are going Cooper flag. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1598.8799999999999s)]
*  He knocked everyone's socks off. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1605.4399999999998s)]
*  People were blown away. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1607.72s)]
*  It's like, we can stop doing that with the Cooper flag workouts. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1609.1599999999999s)]
*  We get it. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1611.72s)]
*  He blows everyone away. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1612.28s)]
*  He's amazing. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1613.3999999999999s)]
*  He's fucking, you know, juggling three balls, beating everybody in drills. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1614.1599999999999s)]
*  Like we get it. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1618.6799999999998s)]
*  He's amazing. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1619.36s)]
*  Um, and then two Harper is locked in, but then we get to three and it's like, I'm [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1620.48s)]
*  prepared for anything. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1624.4s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1625.0400000000002s)]
*  Trade backs. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1625.3600000000001s)]
*  I didn't, there's three guys. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1627.3200000000002s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if they took, I wouldn't be surprised if, if Darrell took [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1628.44s)]
*  ACE, I know you wouldn't either. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1632.0s)]
*  If he was just like, yeah, ACE has the highest upside. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1634.1200000000001s)]
*  I think he'd be a superstar edge comb. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1637.0s)]
*  We think he's Dwayne Wade. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1639.0400000000002s)]
*  He just needs to figure out how to finish the layout. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1640.0400000000002s)]
*  Caniple perfect for the team. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1642.92s)]
*  We have, we think it beads going to play 70 games. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1644.72s)]
*  He fits in, he does this, this, and this. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1646.76s)]
*  It's a, it's an awesome draft. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1649.3200000000002s)]
*  Let's take a quick break. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1650.8000000000002s)]

*  So if you were the Atlanta Hawks, are you building this around Trey [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1688.48s)]
*  young? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1694.92s)]
*  You feel good about that? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1695.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't feel good about it. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1697.92s)]
*  Um, I don't think that Trey young can be the number one guy on a championship team. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1699.88s)]
*  Um, I do think Trey young as the number one guy in a conference that stinks can [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1705.96s)]
*  be the number one guy on an Eastern conference championship team. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1712.88s)]
*  I think they're in play next year. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1716.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1718.64s)]
*  So I think that's the mindset that Atlanta probably has going into this [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1719.52s)]
*  season because it's not a look. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1725.0800000000002s)]
*  They, they, if they want to blow this whole thing up, they can do it next [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1726.88s)]
*  summer, you know, Porzingis is the number one guy on a championship team. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1730.44s)]
*  You know, Porzingis is coming off the books. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1734.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1737.32s)]
*  Young will have one less year left in his contract. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1738.0s)]
*  You'll still have Jalen Johnson to build around long-term. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1740.56s)]
*  Like this is kind of the perfect year to sort of go for it. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1743.88s)]
*  See what you can get with that $25 million trade exception. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1748.24s)]
*  See if there's some guy that fits, you know, either in the back court [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1751.4s)]
*  alongside Trey, four spot, I don't know, wherever they think is the right fit [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1754.92s)]
*  and go for it this year. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1758.8s)]
*  Um, and if it doesn't work, screw it. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1760.3600000000001s)]
*  Then next year there'll be, there'll be a market for Trey Young next year. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1762.32s)]
*  Somebody's going to want to get him. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1765.32s)]
*  Like, I mean, nobody wants to sign with Washington. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1766.28s)]
*  Maybe they take them on. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1768.1599999999999s)]
*  Like they, they absorb his contract into, into their books. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1768.9199999999998s)]
*  Like there's a lot of things you can do if you're Atlanta beyond this season. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1771.9199999999998s)]
*  Like this, no matter what, they're not going to want to tie it. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1774.52s)]
*  I think we both can agree on that with, with this group, but you can. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1777.9199999999998s)]
*  After Indiana, I'm not willing to agree on anything. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1780.8799999999999s)]
*  15 playoff games. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1784.4399999999998s)]
*  I know Indiana plays with just a, I don't know that if you get guys around [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1786.0s)]
*  Trey Young that are tough like that, Neesmith, Siakam, you know, Nemhardt. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1790.24s)]
*  I don't see those guys in Atlanta. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1794.68s)]
*  I don't see them. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1796.24s)]
*  And look at their depth try. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1797.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't see a ton of those guys. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1797.96s)]
*  I don't, I, I look, but I think in this, this landscape, I mean, you can do it. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1799.28s)]
*  You can make a run with this group, but if you can, great. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1804.88s)]
*  Maybe you see like, Hey, we just one piece away or, and then we'll add that guy [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1807.4s)]
*  in the off season or, you know, you go into next summer and you blow the whole [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1811.36s)]
*  damn thing up, you trade Trey Young and you rebuild around a really good player [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1814.0s)]
*  and all star in Jalen Johnson. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1816.92s)]
*  I think it's all upside for the Hawks. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1818.2s)]
*  We see it the same way. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1820.32s)]
*  I think this is the official Trey Young audition year. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1821.52s)]
*  What do you got here? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1826.0s)]
*  We put, we put a bunch of guys with blank who can, who can protect you on defense. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1828.16s)]
*  We have a little pick and pop threat now with poor Zingas. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1834.2s)]
*  We also have a real center who can protect the rim. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1837.6s)]
*  Um, I don't know what they're going to do with 13th pick and that trade [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1840.52s)]
*  exception, but we assume there's one more really good guy coming. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1843.0s)]
*  And it's like, let's say we've, we've created the type of team. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1846.28s)]
*  I think what they have a chance to do is what we watched Indiana do with [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1849.56s)]
*  Halliburton where they built a roster around a guy's specific skillset and [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1853.2s)]
*  Trace case, they can protect them on defense and they are surrounding them [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1858.6799999999998s)]
*  with shooters and length, which is kind of what you'd have to do. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1862.52s)]
*  Um, and Indiana, um, it's, I, I'm, I'm still, you didn't go to game seven to do. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1866.2s)]
*  I did. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1873.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1874.12s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1874.48s)]
*  I'm still reeling from just that whole thing. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1874.88s)]
*  And then also that, you know, to come that close to winning a title, to have [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1878.64s)]
*  the first five minutes, the way it went. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1882.5200000000002s)]
*  And then to realize much like Celtic fans last month, where it's like, not only [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1884.3600000000001s)]
*  did we just get knocked out of the playoffs, but next year's now gone too. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1889.8400000000001s)]
*  Like it's, it was just so much. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1893.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm still digesting it. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1895.4s)]
*  I can't even imagine what it was like to be there. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1896.64s)]
*  I've, I think that Oklahoma city has emerged as a top three crowd in the NBA. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1899.12s)]
*  I think Boston's better. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1905.68s)]
*  I think New York's better, but I think Oklahoma city is right there. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1907.0s)]
*  You make it argue for somebody else. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1909.72s)]
*  Fine. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1911.08s)]
*  But I think Oklahoma city is right there. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1911.32s)]
*  Uh, in that three spot, I've never experienced a crowd that amped up. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1913.32s)]
*  Just cut it, go completely silent the way that it did. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1918.2s)]
*  Everybody in that moment knew exactly what happened based on how we moved, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1921.92s)]
*  how we responded. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1927.28s)]
*  I mean, players from both sides, crowd media, everybody do. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1928.44s)]
*  I've never seen a, a reaction quite like that when you had a crowd amped up to an [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1931.76s)]
*  11, just going nuts and then have that happen and everything just go completely [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1938.44s)]
*  silent. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1944.4s)]
*  It was, it was surreal man being there and seeing him go down like that. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1944.72s)]
*  And then his reaction banging his hand on the floor. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1948.68s)]
*  And then you watch them, the replay on the monitor and you could see the, the [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1950.84s)]
*  calf buckles, you know, right away, exactly what it is. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1953.76s)]
*  That was tough. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1957.52s)]
*  That was real tough to watch in real time. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1958.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1960.96s)]
*  I was thinking about it because we podcasted after that night and I was thinking [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1961.16s)]
*  after about some stuff I wish I had thought of when we were doing it live. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1964.68s)]
*  Cause I was still like kind of gathering. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1968.2s)]
*  I was just so incredible of a basketball situation or a life situation. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1970.36s)]
*  It was hard to wrap your head around. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1976.16s)]
*  I was thinking about, um, I think it was two, it was my first year I was writing [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1978.04s)]
*  for UPS Panthers second year. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1982.44s)]
*  So it was maybe 2002 playoffs when Dirk got hurt and everybody was like, he's [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1983.8s)]
*  got to suck it. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1989.68s)]
*  He was hurting the playoffs. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1990.3999999999999s)]
*  I think it was against Sacramento and it was so long ago. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1991.52s)]
*  I can't remember, but he was hurt in Cuban. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1995.72s)]
*  Didn't want to bring them back in. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1997.72s)]
*  He wanted him to play hurt. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=1999.72s)]
*  And his whole thing was like, Dirk's going to be our guy for a long time. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2001.08s)]
*  It's not worth it to play him in this playoff series. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2005.24s)]
*  And I remember writing, I think I wrote him my piece. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2008.68s)]
*  Like that's crazy. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2011.96s)]
*  If you have a chance for the title, you have to go it. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2012.92s)]
*  And as I've gotten older, I feel completely differently about it. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2014.96s)]
*  Like, you know, obviously he was hurt. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2018.48s)]
*  Obviously they shot him up so he could play. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2021.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2023.44s)]
*  And then you go out and you tell the, you tell the person, Hey man, you know, be [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2024.24s)]
*  careful, don't you're you're injured. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2029.88s)]
*  Just be careful how you do this. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2033.6000000000001s)]
*  But what happens? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2035.1200000000001s)]
*  You hit a couple threes, the adrenaline's rising, you know, he's going in a time [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2036.0s)]
*  out and you just kind of forget you're hurt, but he was hurt and then he made it [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2040.88s)]
*  worse and now they really screwed up their team. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2044.6000000000001s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2047.0s)]
*  It's just that Cuban Dirk decision. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2048.92s)]
*  I was, I was thinking about that, about, do you play him? [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2050.84s)]
*  Do you, if you play him, are you more careful? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2055.36s)]
*  Like, and Hal Bern's like, I have no regrets. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2057.52s)]
*  It was game seven. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2059.8s)]
*  We had a chance to win the title, but I don't know. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2060.6s)]
*  Something still doesn't sit right with it with me. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2063.8s)]
*  I agree. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2066.84s)]
*  It's like that old, that old parable where the guy drowns and he blames God for, you [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2067.64s)]
*  know, for not saving him. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2074.96s)]
*  It's like we have, we haven't, we have a lot of evidence over the last five years [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2076.12s)]
*  that show that these types of calf injuries lead to a catastrophic injury. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2081.4s)]
*  Like an Achilles tear, the Durant situation. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2087.52s)]
*  I think Dame's injury was kind of some of that him coming back from, you know, deep [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2090.16s)]
*  vein thrombosis and being rushed right back into a high pressure, high octane [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2095.7599999999998s)]
*  situation, like we've got the evidence. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2100.12s)]
*  It's out there. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2102.6s)]
*  It's you just point to it and say, this is the kind of stuff that not only can [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2103.3199999999997s)]
*  happen, but, but does happen at a frequently alarming weight, weight, weight. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2107.3999999999996s)]
*  And I don't know what you tell, like, like Rick Carlisle, you know, I was at all [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2111.9199999999996s)]
*  those games and all the pregame stuff and Rick Carlisle, every single pregame was [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2116.08s)]
*  like, we're watching him, we're watching him, we're watching him. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2118.8399999999997s)]
*  So obviously they're probably telling, and even to Halliburton, I think after [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2120.3199999999997s)]
*  game five, maybe like somebody asked him, like, have you been told that there's [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2123.48s)]
*  not a high risk of injuries? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2127.92s)]
*  Like, no, I've not been told that. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2129.36s)]
*  He knew that something was possible, you know, there, but I don't know how you [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2131.12s)]
*  tell a guy in game seven of the NBA finals, whether or not he made three of the first [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2136.12s)]
*  five shots that he took three threes. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2139.76s)]
*  I don't know how you tell a guy going in, like go at 80%. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2141.7200000000003s)]
*  Like it's impossible to tell a guy. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2145.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2147.2000000000003s)]
*  Just be careful. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2147.48s)]
*  Be careful. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2148.2000000000003s)]
*  Be careful. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2148.64s)]
*  You kind of can't do that because he was careful in game six. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2149.12s)]
*  He wasn't that good. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2151.68s)]
*  Unless you're going to, you know, camp him out in the corner and have him be a decoy. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2152.8s)]
*  Then this, this was always a potential situation. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2158.0s)]
*  Maybe that's what they should have done. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2161.6s)]
*  I mean, they kind of did that. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2163.48s)]
*  They kind of did that for, what was it? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2164.52s)]
*  Game six for a lot of game six. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2166.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2168.7200000000003s)]
*  I think it was, he was kind of hanging on the perimeter, just lingering around. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2169.04s)]
*  Uh, yeah, maybe they should have gone that route, but like, you're never going to be [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2172.96s)]
*  able to tell a guy of that caliber. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2178.6s)]
*  Like, Hey man, this could happen. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2179.92s)]
*  Don't push off as hard. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2181.7200000000003s)]
*  Don't break to the basket. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2183.2000000000003s)]
*  You see an opening like it's too hard to have a guy compartmentalize. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2184.44s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2188.12s)]
*  I'm still wrapping my head around it. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2188.92s)]
*  I I've never seen it. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2190.84s)]
*  Who do you blame? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2191.92s)]
*  Do you like, like, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2192.56s)]
*  it sounds like I don't blame anybody because it's obviously his choice. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2194.1600000000003s)]
*  He wants to play. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2197.52s)]
*  It's no different than like we both love boxing and we love UFC and people make [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2198.28s)]
*  decisions with their bodies and their heads and we watch it over and over again. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2202.36s)]
*  And you can't be like, you dummy. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2206.2000000000003s)]
*  You shouldn't have played. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2208.0s)]
*  Obviously he wanted to play. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2208.7200000000003s)]
*  It was super risky, but I've never, I mean, to come that quote, when you think [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2210.2400000000002s)]
*  of like the two sliding doors of this guy was on pace to be the hero of that game. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2215.6400000000003s)]
*  And then in, at the seven, six minute mark, whenever it was all of a sudden [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2223.7200000000003s)]
*  he's done for a year, like I, I've never seen anything like that. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2228.08s)]
*  And the Tatum thing was horrible when that happened. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2231.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean, that was one of the more traumatic. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2235.0s)]
*  We had two of the most traumatic NBA injuries we've ever had in the span of a [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2236.72s)]
*  month that nobody's been able to explain this Achilles thing. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2240.7599999999998s)]
*  I was texting with doc about it. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2243.2s)]
*  And I was like, nobody had these old, these were old guys injuries. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2245.2s)]
*  These are injuries like my uncle Bob started playing pickleball and he blew out [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2248.6s)]
*  his Achilles, like these don't happen to people in their primes and that we were [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2252.12s)]
*  saying, I was like, when, when you were playing, I was saying this to doc, like, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2258.04s)]
*  you know, you just play pickup in the summer, right? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2263.3999999999996s)]
*  You weren't doing these like 365 days a year, all this training and practicing [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2267.08s)]
*  Euro steps and footwork, and maybe it's too much, like maybe they really have [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2271.6s)]
*  to reevaluate all the stuff they're doing. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2276.2799999999997s)]
*  Doc was saying, we just played pickup every day on concrete and 100 degree [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2277.9199999999996s)]
*  weather, and then our knees went. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2281.6s)]
*  So in the old days, the knees went and now it feels like it's the below [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2283.3199999999997s)]
*  the knees is starting to go. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2287.12s)]
*  And I don't think it's a coincidence that two of the best guys who still were [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2289.0s)]
*  arrow pointing up for their careers had this injury that nobody had before recently. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2293.24s)]
*  Is, is there, so I've texted a few medical people, you know, team trainers, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2298.7599999999998s)]
*  whatnot for theory, it's all theory at this point, but, um, is there anything to [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2304.12s)]
*  the idea that maybe now more than ever, these guys are just basketball players? [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2308.64s)]
*  Like they're, they're not, they're not the specialist. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2315.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2318.52s)]
*  You, you grow up, you know, a lot of guys you cover back in the day, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2318.7999999999997s)]
*  they were football players. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2323.16s)]
*  They were, you know, hockey players. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2324.32s)]
*  And if they grew up in the Northeast, like they were playing other sports [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2326.28s)]
*  nowadays, it's, it's straight basketball. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2328.84s)]
*  Like Cooper flag is actually an example. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2331.16s)]
*  I spent the better part of a couple of weeks around him. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2333.04s)]
*  Um, did he blow you away? [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2336.16s)]
*  Uh, him personally, no, no. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2338.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2341.0s)]
*  Skeet, you know, I mean, the greatest, like he was on the cover of the magazine, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2341.28s)]
*  the greatest Cooper flag supporter is Scal. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2344.48s)]
*  Like he's out of his mind. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2347.48s)]
*  It's supportive this guy. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2348.88s)]
*  He thinks he's like LeBron. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2349.8s)]
*  Like this is, you know, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2351.04s)]
*  he might have to settle down a tad, but you do, you, you put, you put together [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2352.48s)]
*  your Mount Rushmore tomorrow, like in day one of the season, Scal is going to have [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2356.0s)]
*  Cooper flag on the top of that on that Mount Rushmore, but he's like, to this [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2359.08s)]
*  point, like he grew up, uh, you know, in first grade, second grade, he was a great [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2363.2s)]
*  football player, you know, this is why they consider prodigy, graded everything. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2367.76s)]
*  Football, uh, played soccer, played baseball, but just stopped after I think second [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2370.72s)]
*  or third grade, whenever it was, and then just focused entirely on basketball. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2375.64s)]
*  That's what a lot of these guys, Jason Tatum, when he got to a young age, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2379.2400000000002s)]
*  you know, got with Drew Hanlon when he was young and started working on skills. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2382.48s)]
*  Just this. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2385.72s)]
*  Um, I wonder if there's anything to the singular focus on the game where you're [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2386.8s)]
*  not kind of, you know, doing other things that might protect your, your, your body [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2390.72s)]
*  from these types of, of injuries. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2395.56s)]
*  Again, it's all theoretical, but this kind of came up with a couple of training [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2397.56s)]
*  people that, that I've talked to, but it's worth looking into more if you're the NBA. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2401.08s)]
*  Like having, having Kobe tear his Achilles in the backend of his career is one thing. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2404.92s)]
*  Having, you know, an alpha, an MVP candidate like Tatum, the star of the postseason, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2409.64s)]
*  like Halliburton, like this is something that, that they need to look at. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2415.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2418.4s)]
*  Kobe, who was playing those 48 minute games during that stretch, right. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2418.64s)]
*  And he's at the end of his career and he pushed it too far and it made sense. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2422.76s)]
*  It doesn't these, the equipment's too good. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2425.8s)]
*  The training stuff's too good. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2429.36s)]
*  The medicines to everything's too good for, to have this injury. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2430.92s)]
*  I don't really fully understand it. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2434.4s)]
*  And I also don't understand why it's not happening in other sports. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2435.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2439.2400000000002s)]
*  Like it's not happening in tennis. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2439.84s)]
*  You know, it's not, I think Tiger tore his Achilles in golf, but it's just. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2442.2000000000003s)]
*  Anyway, that was a, that was quite a tangent. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2447.6800000000003s)]
*  We just did what players. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2449.96s)]
*  So you're, you're obviously texting a million people and we're all sifting [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2452.4s)]
*  through the same bullshit, not knowing what's real and not real. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2455.48s)]
*  And then anytime a trade happens, it's like, that's a trade. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2459.6s)]
*  Like I thought Drew was going to Dallas or Phoenix. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2462.6800000000003s)]
*  I really did. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2464.84s)]
*  And I would have bet on Dallas. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2466.36s)]
*  I would have bet. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2468.24s)]
*  I thought Dallas was like minus 200 for a true home. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2469.3999999999996s)]
*  I thought it was going to be two pieces. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2471.96s)]
*  One gets rerouted to Brooklyn or Atlanta, wherever, and their trade exception, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2474.0s)]
*  Boston keeps the other piece and Dallas gets drew Portland comes. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2479.2s)]
*  And then it's like, oh yeah, they've loved him the whole time. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2483.0s)]
*  It's like, really? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2485.04s)]
*  I didn't hear that once. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2485.52s)]
*  Is there a player that you're hearing floated around a name that has surprised [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2487.08s)]
*  you as we are now 24 hours away from the draft? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2492.68s)]
*  Is there somebody who are like, Whoa. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2496.2799999999997s)]
*  That guy. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2498.08s)]
*  I don't know if it's a, well, New Orleans is very much open for business. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2500.8799999999997s)]
*  Zion, not particularly, but they're a team that is determined to shake things up. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2507.3199999999997s)]
*  Like could Herb Jones be available in New Orleans? [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2513.52s)]
*  I mean, that's a small name, but I think that's something interesting. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2516.7999999999997s)]
*  Um, again, I don't know what Philadelphia is going to do here. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2521.52s)]
*  Um, are they, do they just sit on that draft pick and take it to the, try to [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2527.92s)]
*  package it this is Paul George in play. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2533.04s)]
*  You know, I've heard some of that over the last, uh, 24 hours or so that they [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2535.44s)]
*  could be looking to trade back with Paul George to do something there. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2540.2000000000003s)]
*  Um, yeah, those, the Philly stuff is what I've been most looking at. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2545.32s)]
*  I think the Charlotte thing is the next one. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2550.96s)]
*  I think Charlotte is very open for business at number four to move down. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2552.48s)]
*  Um, and I think there's a team that's going to be in play that tries to [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2556.52s)]
*  move up and, and take, uh, take that Charlotte spot. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2560.2s)]
*  I'm intrigued by the Quippers who don't seem like they have a lot going on, but [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2564.08s)]
*  also don't seem to be super happy with their roster, just like what, where's [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2568.6s)]
*  the evidence they're going to be better this year than, or this coming year than [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2575.0s)]
*  they were, and I thought they were right there with some of these other teams, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2578.32s)]
*  but I also think they're going to be a year older next year. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2582.1200000000003s)]
*  Um, I, I'm just, they've been quiet, which makes me suspicious. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2585.2400000000002s)]
*  And then the team I cannot figure out for the life of me is Miami. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2590.56s)]
*  Cause I've heard they didn't offer anything for Durant. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2594.88s)]
*  If you talk to some different like NBA team people, they're like, we heard the [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2598.44s)]
*  Miami thing was like close to being done and something happened. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2604.0800000000004s)]
*  I don't know what to believe anymore. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2608.16s)]
*  And I don't know what Miami is up to. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2609.48s)]
*  And, and, you know, usually they're star hunting right around now and they've [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2611.04s)]
*  been quiet too, and I don't know, are they going to zag and go the other way? [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2615.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2620.9199999999996s)]
*  The Miami part of it, from what I heard after the deal got done was, you know, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2622.3199999999997s)]
*  Khalil Ware was off the table and really the only thing that was on the table was [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2627.2s)]
*  Wiggins, some contract filler, a little bit of draft capital, nothing at all. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2631.96s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2637.48s)]
*  Substantial. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2638.0s)]
*  That's like nothing. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2638.44s)]
*  They didn't, which means they didn't really want him. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2639.2400000000002s)]
*  I, but I, Bill, I don't know who, like besides Houston, who really wanted him [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2641.32s)]
*  this obviously, I think the Clippers, you mentioned them, I think they were [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2646.28s)]
*  interested, they just don't have anything to really offer that Phoenix might be [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2648.92s)]
*  looking for, um, San Antonio, San Antonio was clear. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2653.56s)]
*  There was some, I don't know if the hard and tires were kicked. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2658.16s)]
*  Oh no, no. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2663.44s)]
*  That, that wouldn't be, that would be bad. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2664.96s)]
*  It didn't work, but I'll put it this way. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2668.44s)]
*  I don't think Hardin's game seven went over great. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2672.44s)]
*  You think I don't think it went over great with literally anybody on the, on [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2676.36s)]
*  the Quippers. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2681.36s)]
*  So, and, but I also don't think there's a market for him, but if we were talking [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2682.2400000000002s)]
*  about like most shocking name that you could see getting traded in the next [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2686.2400000000002s)]
*  week, that isn't actually shocking. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2690.28s)]
*  He would be on my side. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2692.08s)]
*  I just don't know who it would be trading for. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2693.12s)]
*  I mean, there was no market for him last off season and the Clippers gave him a [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2694.8399999999997s)]
*  deal that he never would have gotten anywhere else. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2699.0s)]
*  Like that was, I never understood that deal at the time. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2702.3599999999997s)]
*  I don't think the Clippers want to pay Norman Powell long-term either. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2706.12s)]
*  They had a great year last year, but has he plateaued as a player? [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2710.3599999999997s)]
*  Is that going to be a, if they give him money, is that going to be a contract [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2715.72s)]
*  they're trying to get off of in two years? [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2718.48s)]
*  I think they have that mindset. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2720.72s)]
*  Just the Durant stuff, like I've been riding Houston since last February, [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2721.8399999999997s)]
*  because I knew from being around the Rockets, how much Emei liked him and how [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2727.6s)]
*  much Durant respected Emei from the Brooklyn days and USA basketball days, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2732.48s)]
*  and how well the fit worked. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2736.2799999999997s)]
*  Like I went down there in February, March to do something on, on Amen. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2737.3999999999996s)]
*  And like, even then, like Rafael Stone was, you know, on and off the record was [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2742.2799999999997s)]
*  like, we're not doing anything. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2745.8799999999997s)]
*  Like we're, we're, we're not doing anything. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2746.72s)]
*  Like we're, we're trying to see what this team looks like in the playoffs. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2748.8s)]
*  And they got, they got their look. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2754.28s)]
*  They got the look. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2755.2400000000002s)]
*  Jalen Green's not the guy. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2755.6800000000003s)]
*  Jalen Green is never going to be the guy. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2756.6400000000003s)]
*  So now they go out and maybe it's not a round peg round hole type of [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2758.2000000000003s)]
*  fit in the age of Durant, but I believe that Kevin Durant is still capable of [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2761.44s)]
*  being like one of the best scores in the NBA for 65 plus games in a season. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2768.32s)]
*  And I think given what I saw from that team in the playoffs last year, that's [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2773.0s)]
*  exactly who they need. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2776.84s)]
*  Like especially in the playoffs themselves, a hundred percent. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2778.16s)]
*  That's what they need. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2781.0s)]
*  You replace, you replace Kevin Durant, healthy Kevin Durant with, you [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2781.48s)]
*  swap out Jalen Green, they beat Golden State in the first round. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2785.56s)]
*  Like I don't know what the ceiling is after that, but they beat [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2788.68s)]
*  Golden State in the first round. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2792.08s)]
*  I think, I think the Rockets who are going to get real organic growth from [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2793.4s)]
*  their young guys next year, starting with Thompson, who I think is an absolute [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2798.08s)]
*  monster waiting to break out. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2801.24s)]
*  I think they're now in play to win the Western Conference. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2804.84s)]
*  And if I was looking at the biggest, biggest threats to Oklahoma City next [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2807.44s)]
*  year, without knowing exactly what Denver is going to look like, I would say [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2811.04s)]
*  Houston's at the top of that list. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2816.08s)]
*  We agree. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2818.76s)]
*  And I also, what, what's so interesting about that trade, I wish I had said this [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2819.28s)]
*  Sunday when we talked about it, it feels like they still have a trade left. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2823.08s)]
*  They were able to keep enough assets to do another move. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2828.2000000000003s)]
*  Like, I don't think the Celtics are trading Jalen and I hope they don't. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2831.76s)]
*  But if they did trade Jalen, weirdly Houston is still the best home for him. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2835.76s)]
*  They'd have to put the Van Blee thing in it to make it work. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2839.6800000000003s)]
*  But, and I think Tarri, he's someone who would have to be in it, but [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2842.08s)]
*  that with all the picks they have, there's a move now, a little reminiscent. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2844.52s)]
*  We've seen this in years, like the 07 to 08 Celtics was the best example of like, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2849.28s)]
*  you do this one move and then that opens the door for the second move. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2854.6s)]
*  Makes more sense, right? [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2857.56s)]
*  Do the Ray Allen trade. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2859.0s)]
*  Now KG trade makes more sense than it did if it was just going to be KG and Paul. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2860.84s)]
*  I just, I can't count out Jalen and Houston, even though I don't want [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2865.44s)]
*  Boston to trade Jalen, I don't think they're going to. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2871.0s)]
*  I don't know that Houston has enough to get Boston's attention there. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2873.44s)]
*  Like the Van Blee contract and what else? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2877.7200000000003s)]
*  Like you want to take on the Sun's picks in 27, 29? [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2881.2000000000003s)]
*  Like you want, I mean that, I don't know that how, Jalen's got to be worth more than that. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2885.52s)]
*  Udais could be all the, basically all the picks and Eason and Van Blee's contract. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2889.44s)]
*  You're right. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2894.36s)]
*  It probably isn't enough, but it's enough for somebody and it keeps them in the [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2894.76s)]
*  Yanis area too in January, February, if that goes bad. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2898.92s)]
*  I thought San Antonio was the most, and I said this a couple of weeks ago. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2903.96s)]
*  I thought San Antonio was the most interesting team for Jalen if they [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2908.32s)]
*  decided to go that direction. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2912.28s)]
*  Now I think. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2913.52s)]
*  Still are. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2913.96s)]
*  Still are. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2915.08s)]
*  But I got the Spurs maybe just keeping their powder dry in case the Yanis [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2915.56s)]
*  thing just bursts and like they can make a play there. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2918.88s)]
*  But if that's not on the table, they can very easily put together a package that [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2921.92s)]
*  makes a lot of sense for both sides. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2928.24s)]
*  I to bring it full circle to Boston though, like I like that. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2929.6s)]
*  It sure seems like they're not jettisoning Jalen here. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2934.12s)]
*  Like that, that I think was a thought, you know, as they were trying to figure [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2937.4s)]
*  out what to do with this team moving forward, but I liked that they're not. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2940.96s)]
*  Dumping this guy because it's hard to get two guys like Tatum and Brown. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2944.88s)]
*  Like it's hard to get two guys that you know, can win together on a championship [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2950.72s)]
*  level, and I liked that they're keeping him intact, keeping him there and [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2956.7999999999997s)]
*  presumably going to keep him as part of a two or three person core that they're [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2960.8399999999997s)]
*  going to build around in the summer of 2026. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2965.4399999999996s)]
*  I just think that's the right move for them to make. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2967.52s)]
*  And look, teams were calling about Jalen. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2970.12s)]
*  Several of them calling to see the availability. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2972.72s)]
*  It was a hot market for him in white. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2975.16s)]
*  There's no question. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2976.8399999999997s)]
*  No question. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2978.0s)]
*  But the South Beach were pretty firm that, that, you know, yeah, next year [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2978.92s)]
*  may suck for them, you know, it may, it may even be a lottery year, which I don't [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2982.48s)]
*  think would disappoint too many people given that they have their pick. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2985.6400000000003s)]
*  It may be bad, but 2026 we're back. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2988.28s)]
*  Like, you know, y'all must have forgot with, with, with us in the fall of 2026 [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2992.0s)]
*  when Tatum comes back from that injury. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=2998.84s)]
*  That's that to me is what their, their mindset is. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3000.1600000000003s)]
*  You know, who's not tanking Joe Missoula who's this absolute psycho. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3003.6800000000003s)]
*  Oh, isn't this fascinating? [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3007.48s)]
*  I'm glad you brought that up. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3009.04s)]
*  This would be an absolute psychology experiment watching him intentionally lose [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3009.92s)]
*  games and play lineups that would, uh, there's just no way I don't see it. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3016.4s)]
*  That's why I think that I think it's more likely they win 48 to 50 [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3020.44s)]
*  games than 32 to 35 games. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3023.7200000000003s)]
*  But it may be inescapable that they're, they're not that good. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3026.6800000000003s)]
*  That there may be a 500 type of team. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3030.8s)]
*  I'm fascinated to see how Joe Missoula handles mediocrity. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3032.6400000000003s)]
*  Like, does he like start plucking his eyebrows like after like a three game [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3035.72s)]
*  losing streak, they're going to have to put them on like meds. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3038.92s)]
*  I think he's going to have to be sedated. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3042.12s)]
*  Like when, like, like with, uh, with, when you have little kids and you, you [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3044.08s)]
*  put them on an airplane and you just have to make sure like that, yeah. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3048.64s)]
*  Hey, will you take this Benadryl? [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3052.12s)]
*  I need you. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3053.4s)]
*  I need to, I need to knock you out for a second. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3053.8s)]
*  I don't think he'll be able to handle it. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3056.56s)]
*  I mean, he takes losses so hard. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3058.64s)]
*  We saw that during the last couple of seasons. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3061.32s)]
*  Take a leave of absence. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3064.16s)]
*  Maybe he just leaves the team in January. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3065.3199999999997s)]
*  It's like Joe's going to go learn, learn a next level of Muay Thai in Thailand for [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3067.2799999999997s)]
*  the next four months and we'll bring them back in June. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3072.3599999999997s)]
*  Just walking around challenging guys to Muay Thai fights across Europe and Africa. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3075.16s)]
*  Like I could, I could see that. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3079.04s)]
*  I could see that it will be, it'll be interesting to see how he deals with it. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3080.2799999999997s)]
*  Because this will be new. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3083.96s)]
*  Can we say one thing on Jaylen Brown? [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3086.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3088.0s)]
*  I think it'd be a huge mistake to trade him unless it was like for [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3089.3199999999997s)]
*  200 cents in the dollar. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3092.2s)]
*  And especially after like what the Red Sox did, not to compare the same situation [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3093.7599999999998s)]
*  with Mookie, cause that was different. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3098.0s)]
*  They just didn't want to pay him and they're fucking assholes. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3099.3199999999997s)]
*  Um, I just, I want to see Brown and take them together. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3102.04s)]
*  And I think Jaylen's like really important in the city. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3107.08s)]
*  Like he really gives a shit about the right things. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3109.68s)]
*  And I don't think you can lose guys like that if you don't have to like that. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3111.7599999999998s)]
*  Nobody expects them to win the title next year. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3115.2s)]
*  The salaries are going to be nuts, but they're going to be able to reset this [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3117.48s)]
*  whole apron thing and then make another three year run. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3120.8s)]
*  And I just don't see it. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3123.32s)]
*  I was actually looking at the okay. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3124.6400000000003s)]
*  See, trying to figure out when they get screwed. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3126.1600000000003s)]
*  Cause this is one of the legacies of this Celtics run. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3129.32s)]
*  And then you think like, okay, see that, oh, they're so positioned and they are [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3132.76s)]
*  in a lot of ways, right? [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3135.8s)]
*  They're young and they have draft picks. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3136.84s)]
*  They have flexibility, but then they really don't. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3138.4s)]
*  When we get to the 27, 28 season, I was trying to map out if they give chat [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3141.7200000000003s)]
*  Jaylen Williams, the, you know, the contract extensions, which would be. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3146.04s)]
*  Um, five for two 47, right. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3150.7200000000003s)]
*  And nobody takes less anymore. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3155.04s)]
*  Like Chet's like, I want to help the team. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3156.76s)]
*  I'll do five for 200. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3158.84s)]
*  Like he's going to take the two 47. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3160.08s)]
*  So that would kick in in the 26, 27 season and Shays super max really kicks [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3162.64s)]
*  in for the 27, 28 season, all of a sudden he'd be making 65.5 million a year. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3169.08s)]
*  And Chet and j-dub would, uh, would be making 46 and 46. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3176.68s)]
*  So just for those three guys, you're looking at $158 million for three guys. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3182.8s)]
*  And the second apron for that year would be around two 30. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3189.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3192.2s)]
*  Cap will go up. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3192.52s)]
*  It'll yeah, those numbers. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3193.2s)]
*  I was, I was trying to factor in the cap because the cap goes up 10% max every [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3194.32s)]
*  year and the aprons tied to that. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3198.36s)]
*  So they'd have about 70 million left for the rest of their roster after those three [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3200.8s)]
*  guys. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3204.72s)]
*  And the point is the NBA has created this league now where even if you do [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3205.12s)]
*  everything correctly, you make all the right trades, all the right draft picks. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3208.9199999999996s)]
*  You just fucking nail every step. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3212.4399999999996s)]
*  You're still fucked like three years later and the Celtics are the latest [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3215.52s)]
*  example we're seeing Denver now that they can't even build around. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3219.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3222.9599999999996s)]
*  I want to talk about that in a second. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3223.08s)]
*  Um, but I just think when I wish I had said this on Sunday night, when we talk [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3224.8799999999997s)]
*  about like, oh, they're going to own the rest of the decade, it's like, I think [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3229.4399999999996s)]
*  we're talking three, four year windows for anybody because it's too hard after that. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3232.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3237.12s)]
*  They're look, they're more equipped than any team in the last, what, five, six [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3237.56s)]
*  years to have sustained success. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3243.84s)]
*  I mean, Milwaukee, they didn't have it in part because they went all in to get a [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3246.84s)]
*  guy like holiday and cost themselves some picks and they, and they, and they [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3252.08s)]
*  traded drew assets too. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3255.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3257.6s)]
*  They, they missed like on these picks though. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3258.28s)]
*  Like that's a big part of it too. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3260.28s)]
*  Like the guys they drafted can't play, um, Denver kind of the same thing, not as far [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3261.4s)]
*  as giving away draft capital, but when the veterans got too expensive for that team [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3266.44s)]
*  and maybe they should have spent a little more money, especially on guy like KCP, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3271.04s)]
*  um, their young players were not ready to step in and play. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3274.8s)]
*  Well, and then they did the Zeek Naji extension. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3278.88s)]
*  They extended Porter to the point that he's untradeable making 40 million a year. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3281.1600000000003s)]
*  Like, it was like a Walmart deal there. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3285.52s)]
*  That was a, that was a bad deal for us. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3288.08s)]
*  A bad one. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3290.4s)]
*  Um, Oklahoma city to me though, is, is a little bit different and you know this, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3291.48s)]
*  but like the way that the contracts are set up over the next three years, help [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3295.28s)]
*  them navigate the books. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3300.56s)]
*  And I'm talking about the team options. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3301.6s)]
*  Like there are a lot of team options. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3302.96s)]
*  You look at that, those books, Bill, that, those, that doesn't happen in today's [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3304.7200000000003s)]
*  NBA. Hardenstein's got a team option next summer. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3308.6800000000003s)]
*  Um, Isaiah Joe, I think has a team option. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3312.28s)]
*  He does. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3314.96s)]
*  The year after that, Lou Dort. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3315.44s)]
*  Lou Dort does as well. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3317.12s)]
*  Another one there. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3318.52s)]
*  Like you can either let these guys go and shave that money off your books and get [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3319.48s)]
*  underneath one of those aprons, or you can convince someone like Hardenstein to, [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3324.04s)]
*  you know, take a little bit less to stick around and be part of maybe something he [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3327.76s)]
*  likes being a part of. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3331.76s)]
*  Dort, Dort I think might be different. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3332.68s)]
*  I think there's going to be a big market for Dort next summer. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3334.2s)]
*  If he's a free agent, um, I think he's a great player, but you've got Kacen Wallace [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3336.16s)]
*  looking to step in and look, even next year, like I did a little, I did a little [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3342.16s)]
*  reporting Bill around, uh, young Nicola Topich during the finals. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3346.64s)]
*  Lot of Oklahoma city excitement about Nicola Topich. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3351.3199999999997s)]
*  Lot of guys that have been scrimmaging with him. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3354.52s)]
*  Uh, you know, Kenridge Williams talks to me for a while about him. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3357.2s)]
*  Dagno big fan of Nicola Topich. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3360.48s)]
*  Like it's not, it's not an obvious path, but if they can just get these guys to hit, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3362.96s)]
*  if they can get Topich to become part of their top eight or nine as early as next [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3367.44s)]
*  season, if they can get Kacen Wallace to be good enough to step in and replace [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3371.52s)]
*  Lou Dort down the line, if they can hit on one or two of these next, what are [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3376.4s)]
*  the seven picks right now in the next four years of the draft, they can just hit on [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3381.28s)]
*  these guys. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3384.76s)]
*  They got, they got a chance here to do what all those other teams we just [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3386.4s)]
*  mentioned have not done. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3389.44s)]
*  So I'm, I'm a little more optimistic. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3390.28s)]
*  Um, who's mundane. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3392.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3394.12s)]
*  That's another guy that, you know, they're, they have guys, they have guys that, you [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3394.32s)]
*  know, they're not going to step into your top three or four, but they don't need [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3398.8s)]
*  them to do that. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3400.96s)]
*  They need guys between four and eight to be consistent. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3401.52s)]
*  I think they've got more potential than any team of the last, in the last five, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3404.96s)]
*  six years to have that. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3408.8s)]
*  We 100% agree. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3410.88s)]
*  If any team is going to pull it off, it's kind of the way I'm says on your show. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3412.76s)]
*  I want all the real estate on Topa child. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3415.76s)]
*  I'm in too. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3418.04s)]
*  I'm, I'll go on Redfin right after looking at it. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3419.0s)]
*  You get a condo. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3422.12s)]
*  So I'm, I agree with everything you just said. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3423.36s)]
*  I'm talking three years from now. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3427.48s)]
*  Here's, here's the counter. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3429.0s)]
*  And did you, I didn't, you didn't go to Indiana, right? [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3432.08s)]
*  For three and four. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3434.96s)]
*  I did. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3436.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3436.44s)]
*  Oh, I didn't, somehow I didn't see you. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3436.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3438.68s)]
*  Um, Dorton Crusoe won game four and that was the game they needed to win this [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3440.08s)]
*  series. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3445.36s)]
*  And the problem with all of this is you still need guys like that. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3446.52s)]
*  So it's like, oh yeah. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3450.8s)]
*  Wallace will praise Lou Dord. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3451.8s)]
*  It's like, Willie Lou Dord was fucking awesome in that game for, and so it was [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3454.52s)]
*  Crusoe and it's like, and you think about like the Celtics in 24, like drew holiday [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3458.76s)]
*  in the Indiana series, like some of the stuff he was doing, the poor Zingas, the [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3464.6s)]
*  boost he was, you just lose that and the series can tilt in the wrong way. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3468.72s)]
*  And I honestly think if Indy wins game four, that series is done in six. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3473.68s)]
*  I really believe it. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3478.2s)]
*  I think Indy would have finished the series. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3479.0s)]
*  I think there was this moment in time in that second half where they had the [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3480.68s)]
*  series and they just couldn't close it. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3484.56s)]
*  So we'll see if they can do it. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3486.2s)]

*  they take, like they can keep replenishing that dork Caruso spot. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3492.72s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3496.3999999999996s)]
*  What did you think of the Cronkite thing today? [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3497.16s)]
*  That I got a lot of texts about that one today. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3500.72s)]
*  Cronkite just. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3503.0s)]
*  He's like, yeah, we basically opened the door for, we might have to trade [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3504.8799999999997s)]
*  Yoke Hitch if he doesn't want to sign an extension. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3508.7599999999998s)]
*  It was the most needless media story I've ever seen, which makes it [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3510.7999999999997s)]
*  thinking, makes me think it was intentional. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3514.44s)]
*  I just don't think you make a mistake like that in a press conference when all [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3517.56s)]
*  of these guys are trained to just measure your words, say things carefully. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3521.4s)]
*  I don't think it was an accident. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3528.52s)]
*  I really don't. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3530.0s)]
*  I haven't, I've read the quote. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3531.32s)]
*  I haven't watched the quote and I always want to watch it first just to make sure [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3533.2400000000002s)]
*  that understand fully the context, but the right answer for any question about [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3536.52s)]
*  Nicole Yoke Hitch is we're building around him forever. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3541.44s)]
*  We want a statue of him in front of the building. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3544.8s)]
*  That's it. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3547.8s)]
*  That's it. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3548.1600000000003s)]
*  He's never playing anywhere else. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3548.52s)]
*  He's our guy. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3550.04s)]
*  Him saying it, the word trade should never wind up in the same three sentences [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3551.56s)]
*  within three sentences of Nicole Yoke Hitch. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3556.44s)]
*  The way he framed it was like, it made me think, and this, there's always been [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3558.32s)]
*  this stuff floating around, who knows if it's true, but it made me wonder if they [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3564.08s)]
*  think he wants to be there for the rest of his career or not. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3568.52s)]
*  The way it was, there was something weird about the way he said it that made me [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3572.4s)]
*  think they're nervous that if anybody's just going to be like, I'll see you guys [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3576.96s)]
*  later, I'm going to go over here now. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3580.68s)]
*  Like, who knows? [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3582.48s)]
*  Who knows what that dude, I don't know. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3584.16s)]
*  I thought, I just thought it was a notable moment. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3586.72s)]
*  Sometimes in the NBA, there'll be these little press conference moments or [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3589.3199999999997s)]
*  something said in a locker room or just some sort of Ted bit where you go, huh, [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3593.24s)]
*  that kind of came out of nowhere. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3597.6s)]
*  What did that mean? [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3598.9199999999996s)]
*  So I'm just, I'm noting it. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3600.3999999999996s)]
*  Don't you think that, don't you think that like Yoke Hitch to me is more likely [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3602.3599999999997s)]
*  to just decide at the end of his next contract that he's not going to play [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3608.08s)]
*  anymore, like I'm just going to go back to Serbia and race horses and I've made [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3611.08s)]
*  enough money and I don't want to train like this anymore. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3616.52s)]
*  Like that, that to me, that's always been like something you should be, people [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3618.7200000000003s)]
*  should be wary about with Yoke. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3622.7200000000003s)]
*  It's like, everybody says like, he's got the kind of game that could, that's [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3624.36s)]
*  going to age really well and it probably will, but I don't see him at like age [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3628.16s)]
*  39, like pulling like an Arvita subonus. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3633.48s)]
*  Like I don't see him. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3636.12s)]
*  I just don't see him playing until the wheels come off. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3637.7599999999998s)]
*  I think he's got a clock in his head for exactly how long he wants to play. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3639.56s)]
*  But regardless, [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3645.6s)]
*  I've heard this theory that he's really like, this was going around like a year [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3647.2s)]
*  ago, if anyone's likely to just be like, I'll see you guys later. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3651.04s)]
*  Thanks for everything. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3654.64s)]
*  It's him. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3655.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't believe it. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3657.16s)]
*  That dude's too competitive. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3658.68s)]
*  And you, you've been to some of these playoff games when he's really locked in [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3661.08s)]
*  and he's a maniac. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3664.36s)]
*  I don't think you're going to be like, all right, I'm just going to play in [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3665.88s)]
*  a shitty league now. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3668.1600000000003s)]
*  I think that guy wants to, you know, that what he did against OKC with the [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3669.12s)]
*  supporting cast he had, especially as we saw what happened with this OKC team. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3673.88s)]
*  Um, pretty, pretty crazy. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3679.0s)]
*  What else did we have? [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3681.6s)]
*  Anything else we need to hit before we go? [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3682.36s)]
*  I mean, I'm going to talk boxing at the tail end, but any other NBA [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3684.4s)]
*  storylines you're excited about or no? [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3687.44s)]
*  Uh, I think that's, yeah, that's here. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3690.32s)]
*  Here's the only throw at you. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3693.36s)]
*  The NBA storyline that might not be applicable now, but could be a year from [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3694.52s)]
*  now, because I think this is the potential biggest free agent that could be out there. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3701.36s)]
*  Sam Presti in Oklahoma city. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3705.68s)]
*  Like we're going to get two expansion teams, probably the next three years. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3707.7599999999998s)]
*  I think the NBA is going to step on the gas with the expansion. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3712.04s)]
*  Now that the Lakers sold for $10 billion. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3715.08s)]
*  You know, who's roadblocking them right now? [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3717.0s)]
*  James Dolan. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3718.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3720.0s)]
*  He's got, he's got a little cabal of anti-expansion owners that he's trying to just, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3721.2400000000002s)]
*  just to, uh, cause he doesn't want to, he doesn't want to share the media rates. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3725.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3729.7200000000003s)]
*  But James Dolan doesn't want to share anything and he doesn't, he votes no at [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3730.2000000000003s)]
*  every single board of governors meeting. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3733.0800000000004s)]
*  Go back and look at some of these meetings. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3734.8s)]
*  Like how many of them are 29 to one? [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3736.48s)]
*  Like he sends his consigliere in cause he doesn't really go to vote. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3738.32s)]
*  He has a couple of people at this time though. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3741.92s)]
*  I don't want expansion. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3744.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3746.32s)]
*  I think this expansion thing's a little more complicated than people are [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3746.64s)]
*  giving him credit for. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3750.8399999999997s)]
*  It might be, but it's not, it's not enough. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3751.6s)]
*  Like, well, how many do you need to expand? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3753.48s)]
*  Is it two thirds? [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3755.7599999999998s)]
*  I thought it was three fourths, but it's somewhere in there. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3757.2799999999997s)]
*  Either way. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3759.48s)]
*  I don't think that Dolan has enough to block. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3760.12s)]
*  As many as that may be out there that quietly don't want to, I think there's a [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3762.72s)]
*  lot that very publicly. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3766.24s)]
*  Can you imagine people are like, yeah, I'm in the Dolan block. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3767.92s)]
*  Dolan's leading the way. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3772.48s)]
*  I'm on his side with it. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3773.56s)]
*  They can imagine like aligning with that. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3774.84s)]
*  I'm taking the expansion fee anyway. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3777.2400000000002s)]
*  But like on the expansion side, like, let's just assume Vegas and Seattle. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3778.96s)]
*  Everybody believes that's how it's going to play out. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3782.7200000000003s)]
*  Like if you're the new Sonics, what's Sam Presti worth to you? [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3785.44s)]
*  Piece of the team, like 2% of the team, 1%, whatever. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3791.0400000000004s)]
*  Same thing with the Vegas gambler, whatever the hell they're going to be called. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3795.36s)]
*  Worth the exact same thing. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3799.2400000000002s)]
*  I think Seattle is better though, because that's the, we lost this guy to Oklahoma [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3801.12s)]
*  city. Now we brought him back to be our architect. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3806.96s)]
*  He was 29 when he came here. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3809.7999999999997s)]
*  He's 49 when he's coming back and he's going to build this team the way, you [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3811.48s)]
*  know, it's, it's prophecy fulfilled, all that stuff. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3814.72s)]
*  Um, I don't know that Sam is looking to leave Oklahoma, but he's been there a [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3817.2s)]
*  very long time and he's not only won them a championship, which is the priority, [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3820.92s)]
*  but he set them up and presumably a Rob Hennigan who would replace him, who I [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3827.4s)]
*  hasn't been seen much in the last 10 years, but his, his lieutenant there, he's [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3832.52s)]
*  got it set up. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3837.04s)]
*  So there's a, a ascension there. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3837.68s)]
*  And look, I've been saying at the time, and I know you knew it too. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3839.92s)]
*  Like Sam, when, when Boston was open before Brad Stevens got it, like Sam was [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3842.6s)]
*  interested, Sam was interested in that job. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3845.7599999999998s)]
*  Um, but the funny thing was Boston really wasn't open. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3847.8s)]
*  I mean, that was one of the things is like we went from Danny to Brad. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3851.4s)]
*  They had a Brad coaching situation. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3854.88s)]
*  And a big contract for him. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3857.4s)]
*  They had Danny ready to, and it just, I, I don't think Presti, did he ever get [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3858.7599999999998s)]
*  to throw his hat in the ring? [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3864.24s)]
*  I don't think he did. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3865.44s)]
*  But externally, nobody, I don't think externally people knew it was going [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3866.0s)]
*  to be that clean and ascension. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3869.32s)]
*  I think people on the outside thought there might be, uh, it might be an open [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3870.64s)]
*  job, but I think when it was thought that way, there was some, I think there [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3875.2s)]
*  was background, Presti, Massachusetts went to Emerson, like dream was to work [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3878.84s)]
*  for the Celtics and just never happened. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3884.0s)]
*  Still hangs out in New England in the summertime with his family. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3886.64s)]
*  Like Zillow does all that. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3889.4799999999996s)]
*  I'm just saying, like, he, he wouldn't have any reason to feel bad [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3890.64s)]
*  about leaving Oklahoma city. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3894.8399999999997s)]
*  He helped win them a championship and he built a winner that can be there [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3896.12s)]
*  sustainable for the next three or four years, uh, the chance to do something [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3898.8399999999997s)]
*  like build a team from, from scratch for a guy like Sam Presti, who has built two, [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3902.9199999999996s)]
*  you know, a title contender back in 2012 with the, with the peak of the Durant [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3909.52s)]
*  Hardin Westbrook years and a title winner that may have won multiple [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3913.88s)]
*  championships by the time his quote free agency comes up. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3918.76s)]
*  I just think that's something to watch. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3922.2400000000002s)]
*  I think that whatever two teams get the expansion rights, I think he is going [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3923.56s)]
*  to be someone that's on their radar. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3929.04s)]
*  And I don't think there's any price, probably too high for getting a guy [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3931.32s)]
*  like Sam Presti to run your team. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3935.44s)]
*  Manix. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3937.44s)]
*  He'd done it again. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3937.84s)]
*  It's a great call. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3938.76s)]
*  He's accomplished his job. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3939.7200000000003s)]
*  He won the action movie. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3942.2000000000003s)]
*  He saved everybody in the burning building. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3943.36s)]
*  Now, uh, if he leaves, you couldn't be mad about it. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3946.1600000000003s)]
*  Um, there's also like, if he left, like, I don't think expansion is going [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3949.08s)]
*  to be a couple of years from now. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3952.84s)]
*  That's right around the time. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3953.76s)]
*  Maybe you'd want to get away from this. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3954.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3957.08s)]
*  See thing, but he had an incredible run. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3957.4s)]
*  If I'm Seattle, I guess the precedents would be like Pat Riley in Miami 30 years [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3960.08s)]
*  ago and they brought him in, he got a little taste of the team and the whole thing. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3964.08s)]
*  Um, all right. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3969.1200000000003s)]
*  Well, we'll see what happens in the draft. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3969.88s)]
*  Let's do boxing really quick though. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3971.6s)]
*  Casual boxing fan bill is here. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3973.92s)]

*  Big fight bill. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3976.96s)]
*  Big fight bill who didn't even know that you were announcing, uh, one of the [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3978.32s)]
*  Paul brothers this weekend in Anaheim, but who's he it's Jake Paul. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3981.48s)]
*  Who's he fighting this weekend? [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3985.7200000000003s)]
*  He is fighting Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3987.2000000000003s)]
*  Who, uh, who, uh, lifetime ago was the middleweight champion of the world has [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3991.6400000000003s)]
*  fallen on some hard times as of late. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=3997.6800000000003s)]
*  Young Chavez Jr. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4000.0s)]
*  Has had some documented drug and alcohol problems. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4001.44s)]
*  Uh, he actually lost to Anderson Silva in a boxing match, which was not a good [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4004.7200000000003s)]
*  look a couple of years ago, but he's got a big name and he's got a decent following [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4009.6s)]
*  and has a lot of Mexicans on the undercard. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4014.84s)]
*  So this is going to be a interesting arena for Jake Paul on Saturday. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4016.56s)]
*  Okay. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4021.76s)]
*  What's our big fight of the summer? [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4022.2400000000002s)]
*  What are we looking forward to? [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4023.6800000000003s)]
*  Um, Usyk Dubois too is the most interesting right now. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4025.56s)]
*  Um, Dubois knocked out by Usyk 2023, like almost, it'll be almost to the day of the [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4030.88s)]
*  month when he got knocked out by Usyk and he's back in with him, but Dubois has [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4037.48s)]
*  changed a lot over the last two years. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4041.08s)]
*  I mean, he has gotten like a heart and confidence transplant. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4043.52s)]
*  Like he gets with a new trainer and Don Charles, who's a very, very vocal guy. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4048.04s)]
*  And as much about, you know, motivation, kind of Mickey-esque, uh, as he is about [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4052.52s)]
*  tactics and he's helped him put together a run that includes Jarrell Miller, [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4057.0s)]
*  Filip Perkovich, and everybody saw the Anthony Joshua knockout. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4062.2400000000002s)]
*  Like that was the crowning achievement and the title winning win for, uh, for Dubois. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4065.0s)]
*  Now he gets another crack at Usyk who just continues to be an all time great. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4070.6800000000003s)]
*  Doesn't show any signs of slowing down, but I think, you know, if this fight was [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4075.6s)]
*  made a year, year and a half ago, it wouldn't have interested me at all. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4078.76s)]
*  The fact that it's happening now after the, the AJ win, I think it's really interesting. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4082.1600000000003s)]
*  It's gonna be like 80,000 fans in Wembley stadium for, for that fight. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4087.4s)]
*  And I think it's, it's a, it's an interesting fight now that Dubois been on this run. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4090.6400000000003s)]
*  I can't wait because nothing is more fun than throwing Usyk in a parlay with other [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4096.64s)]
*  sports and he's just the most reliable leg every time, just keep betting on him [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4101.64s)]
*  till he loses. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4105.6s)]
*  I'm already, I'm already sowing the positive on Usyk fights. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4106.4800000000005s)]
*  Like it's everything's gravy from this point on, but I'm going to keep [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4110.16s)]
*  throwing them in there. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4112.92s)]
*  And he also Deontay Wilder's back bill on Friday in Kansas places. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4113.88s)]
*  He is, he has come back and he's looking to make one more run at 39 years old. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4119.44s)]
*  Ready to go. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4125.76s)]
*  Here's a good, here's a good question for you that I guarantee your podcast [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4126.92s)]
*  partner, Sergio Mora wouldn't set you up with an alley hoop like this. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4131.48s)]
*  Who has a chance to be boxing's Caitlin Clark? [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4135.5599999999995s)]
*  Ooh, the out of nowhere person that would get everybody excited about the casual [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4139.12s)]
*  fans. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4145.5199999999995s)]
*  Is there anybody? [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4146.8s)]
*  Cause I've given up on Bacoli. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4147.88s)]
*  I sold my stock at a loss. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4149.759999999999s)]
*  That's a good idea. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4151.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4152.759999999999s)]
*  Boxing's Caitlin Clark. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4154.24s)]
*  Just that the, the, the out of nowhere, somebody that could kind of train, even [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4156.639999999999s)]
*  somebody who could be like as big as Oscar was or Canelo was in the early years. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4166.28s)]
*  It's hard to, to like, I thought Ryan Garcia could have been that guy two years [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4171.32s)]
*  ago. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4175.92s)]
*  That's, that's out the door. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4176.16s)]
*  That stock is done. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4177.48s)]
*  That stock's gone. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4178.5199999999995s)]
*  That stock is sold. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4179.24s)]
*  And the problem with being able to predict that is that the amateur ranks are garbage. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4180.92s)]
*  Like nobody comes out of the Olympics anymore. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4187.679999999999s)]
*  Like Oscar used that gold medal as a springboard, you know, even wilder, even [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4189.639999999999s)]
*  wilder. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4195.0s)]
*  Oh wait. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4195.48s)]
*  You want to get even more recent. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4195.84s)]
*  Want a bronze medal, bronze bomber. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4196.8s)]
*  Use that as a springboard. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4198.12s)]
*  Like men's U S Olympians have not had a good run for decades now. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4200.0s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4205.360000000001s)]
*  You know, there's, there's a lot of teenagers I've seen coming up the ranks. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4206.76s)]
*  You know, here's one in the heavyweight division, Moses Atalma. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4210.92s)]
*  I don't know if you heard that name before, but he's fought a bunch of like B level [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4215.04s)]
*  guys that has knocked them all out. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4218.6s)]
*  He has that he's 20 years old and has a little Mike Tyson vibe to him. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4219.88s)]
*  A little bit of a, a little bit of a Mike Tyson. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4224.44s)]
*  He's knocking guys out early, like very early. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4226.04s)]
*  He's not super big either. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4228.4s)]
*  He's like six foot three, but he's got this ridiculous hand speed that guys just [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4229.8s)]
*  can't keep up with. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4234.28s)]
*  He's fighting in August against Dillion White. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4235.24s)]
*  And Dillion White used to be a pretty good fighter in the UK, but as long since [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4239.8s)]
*  past his prime, that is going to be another spectacular knockout for Moses Atalma. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4243.92s)]
*  That that's a guy I would watch. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4249.24s)]
*  He's I don't know about the Caitlin Clark potential cause he's a Brit and [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4250.599999999999s)]
*  uh, but like, does he have Anthony Joshua potential in terms of popularity? [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4254.32s)]
*  He might, he might. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4258.639999999999s)]
*  And if he fights over in the U S more, maybe he gets one of those Lennox Lewis [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4259.639999999999s)]
*  type followings that made Lennox a star. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4263.76s)]
*  That's a good one. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4266.2s)]
*  Good name. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4267.4s)]
*  Hi Manix. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qs_3zTCGjs&t=4268.48s)]
