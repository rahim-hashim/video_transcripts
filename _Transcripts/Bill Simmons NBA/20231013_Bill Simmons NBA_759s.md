# Does the Regular Season Not Matter in Sports Anymore? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8h2VhHgKkA)
*  All of the professional sports leagues right now
*  are in one of the all-time money grabs we've ever seen.
*  Now I was thinking about it last night with the Dodgers
*  because on the one hand, the Dodgers get bounced
*  in three games, right?
*  They play this whole regular season,
*  they get this great record,
*  and then they get bounced, and they're done.
*  And their fans are just irate.
*  They're apoplectic.
*  They can't believe this happened again.
*  Oh my god, we lost momentum.
*  Now, there's some rational Dodger fans
*  that are also like, you know,
*  we did start playing Kershaw in game one
*  of a playoff series, and he didn't make it out
*  of the first inning.
*  They lost Urias during the season,
*  who was their best starting pitcher,
*  and it was a pretty flawed Dodger team.
*  Actually, I wasn't surprised that they lost.
*  I didn't think it was gonna be the Diamondbacks,
*  but in general, the Dodger fans are like,
*  I just spent six months watching this team,
*  and this season ended in 90 hours.
*  You know, we saw this happen in the NBA
*  with the Bucs and the Heat last April.
*  The Heat was an eight seed.
*  The Heat farted around during the whole regular season
*  and turned it on for a couple games,
*  and all of a sudden, the Bucs were gone,
*  which was great.
*  It was really fun.
*  Hockey has had this forever.
*  I had hockey season tickets for a couple years
*  with the Kings, and the regular season
*  was so meaningless and so stupid
*  for a team that knew they were gonna make the playoffs
*  that you almost wondered, what was the point?
*  Why am I paying for this other than to see
*  Connor McDavid or a couple other people?
*  The NFL has expanded to 17 games,
*  which all of us love football,
*  but 17 seems way too many,
*  especially with the injury potential,
*  and they're probably gonna go to 18.
*  They'll just keep the gravy train going,
*  and it's all about the money,
*  and I'm not breaking any new ground by saying that,
*  but at what point do we stop caring?
*  At what point, because I'm there with baseball.
*  Baseball's fun.
*  You put it on every once in a while,
*  but for the most part, if you have a good baseball team,
*  and I've had a few.
*  I had the 2018 Red Sox,
*  were probably the best start to finish baseball team
*  I've ever rooted for,
*  but ultimately they also could've lost,
*  and round one, it would've been over.
*  It's all about the playoffs now,
*  and it feels way more random than it ever did,
*  and I don't know if it's a good thing.
*  I think it's a bad thing for baseball,
*  because people talk about how fun these wild card games are
*  and the pitch clock, and I'm with you.
*  I've watched a ton of baseball,
*  but I also didn't really watch any baseball
*  during the regular season,
*  and I'm somebody who grew up loving baseball.
*  I watched baseball my whole life.
*  I wrote a Red Sox book.
*  Up until probably the late 2000s,
*  I loved baseball equally with every other sport,
*  and now I just don't care as much,
*  and there's a million reasons for that,
*  but the biggest reason is the regular season
*  just doesn't matter at all.
*  You could win 120 games, and it doesn't matter.
*  The other team could just get hot.
*  Look at the Phillies right now.
*  The Phillies, everyone was like,
*  they're built for the playoffs, they're built for the playoffs.
*  That seems like the type of team you should just build.
*  Build a team, who cares about the regular season?
*  Build it for the playoffs.
*  I think Miami has entered this mode in the NBA
*  just year after year.
*  They don't care.
*  They're gonna be like a five-seed, six-seed,
*  seven-seed, eight-seed, doesn't matter,
*  and they'll just see if they can get hot.
*  It's more fun if you have no attention span at all,
*  and maybe it makes more sense in the TikTok generation,
*  but for what I grew up with,
*  and what we used to care about was the totality of everything.
*  The regular season meant this.
*  It really meant something to win 100 games in baseball.
*  It was amazing if your basketball team won 60 games.
*  There were just these little markers
*  that you had in your head,
*  and all this stuff ties in.
*  The load management piece,
*  which the NBA is allegedly trying to fix,
*  I'll believe it when I see it.
*  Football adding more games
*  so that the sport is more random than ever before.
*  There's more chance for injury than there's ever been,
*  and there's more chance for just wacky results,
*  which I think is maybe what they want.
*  I'm not sure I want it.
*  I don't like where we are.
*  Even in baseball, and I think hockey is another one,
*  and I think basketball's another one.
*  I think the home team should get some sort of advantage
*  for being good during the regular season in baseball.
*  This five game series that Dodgers had against the Dbacks.
*  Why wouldn't the Dodgers get all five games at home?
*  Shouldn't the only advantage they get is that
*  if there's a game five where they've just not played
*  for a week, and then you get game five at home,
*  and that's the advantage.
*  Well, I've watched baseball for the last 25 years.
*  The home field advantage, except for maybe the Phillies,
*  doesn't seem to matter at all.
*  The majority of their biggest games on the road
*  during the 2000s and 2010s can count them up.
*  I always felt like the 0-14, the 0-7,
*  I felt like those teams could win anywhere.
*  The 18 team had that crazy extra, extra, extra innings game
*  against the Dodgers where it seemed like the season was over.
*  Guess what?
*  They won the next game.
*  Home field doesn't matter as much.
*  So if it doesn't matter as much,
*  at least make it so that in round one,
*  a team is rewarded for winning 100 plus games,
*  and all their games are at home.
*  And if you want to go in their house and beat them,
*  that seems fair.
*  But to just make it like it's worth one game.
*  I've fought the same way with Milwaukee and Miami.
*  I think it should have been,
*  Milwaukee gets the first two,
*  Miami gets the next two,
*  Milwaukee gets the next three.
*  They earned it.
*  They got the one seed.
*  So we're heading toward this world
*  where regular seasons will continue to be devalued.
*  They'll try to cover it up with fantasy and gambling.
*  But for the most part,
*  there's just gonna be more randomness with the results.
*  And I don't think I like that.
*  I don't know if Miami was a better team
*  than Milwaukee last year.
*  I think Giannis got hurt and Jimmy Butler left his body.
*  And then they beat Milwaukee in a series.
*  And it was fun.
*  But did that mean they were a better team?
*  What's the point of these seasons?
*  Are we just turning everything into March Madness?
*  Feels like we're heading.
*  I'll tell you this though.
*  It's a fucking money grab.
*  With the regular seasons where it's like
*  actually the playoffs is all that matters.
*  And the regular season is just a means to an end
*  and nothing matters.
*  My generation was all these records meant something
*  during the season.
*  It meant something to win 100 games.
*  It meant something to win 60 plus NBA games.
*  Your generation is like what happened to playoffs?
*  That's how we judge you.
*  Do you guys wish it was more like the old way
*  or the new way?
*  I'll start with you, Danny.
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, things change over time.
*  I think what was interesting
*  is when I first started working here,
*  I learned a lot more about NFL history.
*  The playoffs started as an accident.
*  For a long time in the NFL,
*  the team that just won the regular season,
*  you won the league.
*  That's how British soccer still works.
*  The Premier League's like,
*  there is no playoffs,
*  just who won the regular season.
*  And the playoffs happened as an accident
*  almost because they had to let these competing leagues do it.
*  The Super Bowl is because the AFL was playing the NFL.
*  Then they just merged.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know if it's one thing's better
*  or just stuff changes over time.
*  What do you think, Greg?
*  I don't like the regular season.
*  Maybe I'm too Gen Z here,
*  but yeah, I'm living for the playoffs.
*  I think baseball's way too long.
*  I think the NBA's way too long.
*  Records don't matter anymore.
*  I mean, look at in football,
*  games change over years.
*  Now it's like Kirk Cousins and Matt Stafford
*  are gonna be the leading passers
*  in the history of the NFL when it's all said and done.
*  So I wish everything was cut in half
*  and we'd get to the playoffs a lot sooner.
*  I liked the COVID year.
*  I liked when baseball was shorter.
*  I liked when basketball was shorter.
*  I thought it was better.
*  Less injuries too.
*  That's how I'm starting to drift toward
*  because right now we're in this middle ground
*  where they need the regular season
*  so they can make as much money as possible.
*  But the regular season has also been totally devalued.
*  Like I was talking about the Dodgers,
*  how they just get bounced in three games.
*  And if you're a Dodger fan, you're like,
*  why did I watch the regular season?
*  That made no sense.
*  We just bounced.
*  In the NFL, at least,
*  you can have kind of a mediocre regular season
*  and still sneak in.
*  But I do feel like with the NFL and the NBA,
*  most of the time the right team wins.
*  We saw Bucs Heat last year was pretty strange
*  and we'll have weird football games
*  where like a big favorite will lose.
*  But for the most part,
*  the right teams are always kind of around in the end.
*  Other than Heifetz's two giant seasons
*  that continue to, are distressing and awful
*  and to everybody who thinks about 0-7 or 11.
*  But what?
*  I guess the question is,
*  is it more fun if the right team wins every year
*  or is it more fun if it's not that way?
*  I think the reason why people like March Madness
*  is because anything can happen.
*  And like in baseball, it sucks
*  because it's like the worst of both worlds
*  where it's like you play 162 games.
*  And over that course,
*  usually the right teams are in first place, right?
*  But then the Dodgers can come in and have a bad week
*  and now they're out because Arizona got hot.
*  So it almost needs to be the other way around.
*  Like the NBA, the playoffs are so damn long.
*  But because of that,
*  usually the right teams are in the finals.
*  But I think the reason why football's fun,
*  why March Madness is fun is because they're so short
*  and chaotic and you can get hot for a couple of weeks
*  and change the course of a season.
*  Yeah, I totally agree.
*  I mean, also I will say my favorite moment
*  of ever working at this company
*  was you went on a five minute rant, Bill,
*  about how much the Super Bowls, the Giants won,
*  pained you and you didn't realize I was behind you.
*  And that was the best time I've ever had working here.
*  But to your question, I totally agree.
*  Like it's hard not to feel that.
*  I mean, I'm sure you went over the stats in your intro,
*  but what is the top seven teams
*  with the best records in baseball this year out?
*  Like something insane in the Dodgers.
*  I just saw that like the first 100 years
*  or 120 years of the MLB,
*  there were three times ever that a team was eliminated
*  by the playoffs by a team that won 15 fewer games.
*  And the Dodgers just did it like three years in a row,
*  happened three years in the previous century.
*  And so it's hard not to have like a NILAs about it.
*  I think all the sports there are a little different.
*  Baseball, the reality is, I do agree,
*  there's not 162 of anything anymore that is three hours long.
*  Like there's a reason the NFL is literally a 10th as much.
*  And that is the success of the NFL
*  and why it's got the biggest live TV,
*  even though they have the fewest games
*  is everything matters.
*  And I don't know how many people left have watching 140 games,
*  but it's a fraction of the people I know
*  who have to watch every football game.
*  TV shows used to have 26 episodes in a season,
*  now they have eight, it's better.
*  And what do we always say about TV?
*  Stakes, right?
*  Like amid all this, like, you know,
*  the golden era of TV and all this stuff,
*  it's like you need stakes to keep people watching.
*  And that's the football has-
*  It makes no sense that the MLB playoffs
*  are designed the way they are,
*  how long the season is.
*  It's like two wrong things put together.
*  And to the NBA, Bill, I'm curious what you think,
*  like I know you have a lot of thoughts on the NBA schedule.
*  Covering the NFL like I do,
*  I don't mind checking in on the Knicks
*  how they're doing all-star weekend.
*  It's really convenient.
*  Super Bowl ends, I'm like, all right,
*  let me start paying attention to this team.
*  Yeah.
*  I just, they know 70 games is the right number
*  and they just don't want to give up the extra 12 games.
*  It's 100% about money.
*  It's not about quality of play.
*  It's not about quality of product.
*  It's not about the health of the players.
*  It's just like, we make more money if we do it this way.
*  I mean, I'm surprised they haven't pushed it
*  to a hundred games.
*  Sarudy and I were talking after I did the top
*  and he was saying like the structure of football
*  is one of the reasons that people don't mind
*  that the regular season is probably too long
*  because there's a fantasy gambling,
*  picks pool, all these different things.
*  And it's just fun.
*  And it's like when week one starts, you go,
*  oh my God, I got my three fantasy teams.
*  I got to pick them.
*  And you just get lost in it.
*  And it almost doesn't matter how your team does
*  because you have so many other things
*  and it doesn't feel too long.
*  The last couple of years, the 17,
*  once we headed into January
*  and we still weren't in the playoffs yet,
*  that felt a little weird.
*  Like I don't think the playoffs starts
*  until January 15th this year.
*  And it just seems like it gives more time
*  for another Joe Burrow calf injury
*  or an extra week for two to get just crushed by somebody
*  or another week for the Steelers
*  to pull out yet another garbage win
*  and go 11 and six instead of 10 and six.
*  Sorry, Craig.
*  But for the most part,
*  I think people just like the structure and they don't mind.
*  I actually think they could make the football season longer
*  and people wouldn't care.
*  I don't think you can make any other sport a longer season.
*  But I think it's a good idea.
*  I think it's a good idea.
*  I think it's a good idea.
*  I think it's a good idea.
*  I think it's a good idea.
*  I think it's a good idea.
*  I think it's a good idea.
*  I think it's a good idea.
*  I think it's a good idea.
*  I think it's a good idea.
*  I think it's a good idea.
