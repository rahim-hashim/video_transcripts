# Can Memphis Rejuvenate Marcus Smart? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Un6_rOTDU5M)
*  I don't know if you know this, but your co-host on The Mismatch is a Memphis guy, and I'm
*  sure you've talked about the Grizzlies with him once or twice.
*  Really?
*  He is?
*  Is Marcus Smart the most grizzly guy ever?
*  It's like he was created in a lab.
*  It's like they ordered him on eBay.
*  It was like, hey, we have all these check marks of things that might work in our city
*  with our team, with the way we play, with grit and grind.
*  Let's have an expansion draft.
*  Who could we just pick?
*  And then you'd pick Marcus Smart.
*  I actually do think he's going to be awesome for them next year.
*  I predict a huge chip on the shoulder rejuvenation.
*  I can't believe they traded me.
*  I'm going to show them.
*  And I could just see him being awesome.
*  What do you think of him just for next year for them?
*  Well, I mean, you want to really connect it here.
*  Tony Allen goes from Boston to Memphis at age 29.
*  Marcus Smart goes from Boston to Memphis at age 29.
*  With Tony Allen going there with Boston at that time of his career, it felt like, OK,
*  you know, this is, you know, it's time to move on from Tony Allen.
*  Then he plays more years in Memphis than he did in Boston after a great start to his
*  career with the Celtics.
*  So with Marcus Smart, I definitely think he's going to have that chip on his shoulder.
*  And he's probably going to come back and try to go for defensive player of the year
*  again, even though he's playing with Jaren Jackson Jr.
*  And at the least, like their defense, if Smart can tap into more of what he did,
*  the prior season when he did win defensive player of the year, like they could be
*  awesome on defense because he's going to be able to replace Dylan Brooks and be a
*  better offensive presence for Memphis.
*  He's not going to, you know, he's going to chuck shots like Dylan Brooks, but he's
*  better at scoring. He's far better at playmaking.
*  He's going to be more of a connective piece.
*  And with Jaren Jackson Jr.'s development on offense, I think for them, they suddenly
*  have a really interesting offense that would still be able to retain defense because
*  even though, you know, all of us like Tyus Jones, Tyus Jones is not the defensive
*  player that Marcus Smart can be.
*  So for them, I think it makes it makes sense in terms of the player you're adding.
*  It's just the price feels like a bit too much today when we look at, you know, the
*  value of those draft picks from Memphis's standpoint, I totally get it in terms of
*  trying to instill that culture you're talking about that Tony Allen once did, but
*  also just add some kind of scheme flexibility where you're not losing something
*  defensively when Tyus Jones is on there with Ja.
*  You can still be strong and versatile and have guys who can make the right plays off
*  the dribble as well.
*  Yeah, I'm thinking what was the problem with last year's Grizzlies team?
*  Well, pretty easy.
*  Maturity. They needed more adults, right?
*  So now Brooks goes, that's going to help them.
*  We're going to have post figured out my shit, John Morant.
*  Hopefully it would be nice to have a normal version of him again.
*  Smart could help there too.
*  And Smart could help there too.
*  And Smart just being an adult with the different same kind of thing with how the
*  removing Smart from the Celtics team is going to change the energy, right?
*  Whether it's going to be better or worse, we'll see.
*  But they needed something to be different.
*  And I think for the Grizzlies adding him, the fans are going to fucking love him.
*  Like they're going to love him.
*  And we're, Verno's going to be saying to you like the first month.
*  Oh my God, I can't believe you gave us Marcus Smart.
*  You fucking idiots.
*  But here's the thing.
*  I was texting Bill last night with Smart.
*  I was telling him, you guys are so fucking stupid.
*  But here's the thing.
*  I made this point a couple of times during the season, the way he plays,
*  this would be my fear.
*  I'm just planning this for the Grizzlies fans.
*  Just remember I said this.
*  I think he's going to have a huge chip on his shoulder here and et cetera, et cetera.
*  That dude's body has been through a lot.
*  We watched it.
*  We watched his entire career on the Celtics.
*  All the charges he takes, all the collisions, all the big guys that he goes
*  against, the bigger guys that he is defending in the post and they're just
*  like dropping their shoulder into him.
*  I was, you're too young to remember Ben Coats, but I use this analogy at some
*  point last season when Ben Coats was the best tight end the Patriots ever had
*  until Gronk and he was awesome.
*  He was awesome in video games and every time we threw him the ball, he would just
*  get hit by three guys and he would drag.
*  He would just drag these three guys down and it was incredible.
*  And guess what?
*  By like 1998, it wasn't as incredible anymore because he took so many hits
*  and that's my fear was smart.
*  Like we've seen this with other basketball players, these guys that play
*  this style, it's not a style that lasts into your mid thirties, you know, there's
*  definitely a shorter shelf life for it.
*  And I felt like there was a lot of wear and tear with him last year.
*  He had the ankle injury at one point, but defensively, he just couldn't stay in
*  front of guards in the same way anymore.
*  So the guy that I voted for defensive player two years ago, that guy was kind
*  of gone, it popped back up a couple of times, there was that one Philly playoff
*  game when he was just awesome.
*  And it looked like last year's Marcus, but for the most part, you know, you think
*  like Miami couldn't stop Jimmy Butler.
*  Um, wasn't really even guarding him that much.
*  Uh, Philly Harden had those two games where he torched the Celtics.
*  Harden was somebody smart, used to play really well against.
*  So there was a lot of red flags with them last year.
*  And that's what makes me think.
*  Like if you're the Grizzlies, just be careful.
*  The guy who's like, Hey man, you should buy my car.
*  It's great.
*  Now that you don't need to check it out, just take it now.
*  It's in perfect condition, never had an accident.
*  And then you get the car and things start going wrong.
*  Well, that's why it's a gamble for Memphis.
*  You're, you're betting if you're Zach Klein and their journal manager, you're
*  betting that you get the version of Marcus smart.
*  You're talking about that he can get healthy and return to the guy who won
*  defensive player of the year.
*  And for years was an all defensive caliber guy, a stopper against guards,
*  a guy who could battle against bigs.
*  I mean, remember like he was one, somebody defending Chris Stabs, poor
*  Zingis very effectively, right?
*  Like they'd stick him on KP, nevermind like true bigs.
*  He could do it all.
*  And you're betting that happens.
*  However, you know, like another Patriots example here, this could be the Celtics
*  letting a guy go right as the decline is beginning.
*  And we saw the signs of it this past season, as you said, with the, he just
*  didn't have that quickness moving laterally on the perimeter.
*  So I think for Boston, it makes sense from their side of things too, where
*  if they think that this is the beginning of a Marcus smart decline, and if
*  that's the case, well, I mean, it's a massive win for Boston and it's a loss
*  for Memphis, and if it's not, it could end up being a mutual win for both teams.
*  So I think logically it makes sense, especially for Boston with the picks
*  that they're getting and considering everything we talked about with KP, what
*  he provides, but I get it philosophically from Memphis's perspective for like a
*  lot of different reasons.
*  And I think for them,
*  they've made so many of them at this point, you can spare two of them.
*  It's sort of like Oklahoma City and like Indiana and a lot of these teams that
*  are consolidating, they just have so much, so many picks or in Memphis's case,
*  they have so much young talent on their roster.
*  I mean, that guy may never play at all.
*  They cut a guy they drafted during the season.
*  So, I mean, I think they're in that point where like, like these other teams, they
*  just have too many picks or too many good young players where they're just
*  a diminished value asset.
*  Whereas for Boston, it's very valuable to add a young guy on your bench that
*  you hope turns into something.
