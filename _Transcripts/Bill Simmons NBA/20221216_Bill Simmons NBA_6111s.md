# Bill Simmons's Earlier-Than-Usual NBA Trade Value List | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [December 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z024rZR2inQ)
*  All right. Joe house is here. We're taping this in the afternoon on Tuesday before all the Tuesday night games.
*  So if anything crazy happens tonight, don't blame us house big day for you.
*  The NBA just announced all of these new trophies
*  That they named after famous NBA stars and it didn't get enough publicity
*  I don't think they had the Michael Jordan for MVP that trophy john. Havlicek for six man
*  The drunk house trophy that they announced
*  For the player who seems like he might have a drinking problem in real life during the season
*  I think this is your apex mountain the drunk house trophy
*  We just had to edit two house jokes coming off my drunk house trophy joke. We're off to a rollicking start
*  Yeah, so they named all these trophies. I don't know what's going on
*  it started in this nice place with the trophies where
*  Bill russell the finals MVP trophy was like this is great. The dude never won a finals MVP trophy
*  We didn't have it until 1969 jerry west got it on a losing team that year russell never actually won a finals MVP
*  Even though he won 11 titles. We're gonna name the trophy after him great idea awesome
*  And then it's like the all-star game trophy for kobe. This is great, too kobe passed away
*  Good way to remember him
*  And now everybody's getting a trophy and they're just basically ripping through
*  All of the great players in history
*  There's a lot of weird things about this. One of the weird things is who asked for this
*  Who was sitting around going?
*  I wish the trophies were named like I don't watch the oscars and go
*  I can't wait to see who wins the marlon brando best actor award
*  It's just fundamentally stupid and then the other thing is they're using up all these names so that
*  30 40 years from now what happens? What do we do with like lebron james?
*  What happens if john moran becomes one of the greatest parts of all time?
*  We're basically just locking into all the great guys from the last 50 years and then we have no flexibility after
*  I'm just confused. Why are they doing this? Well?
*  A few reasons I think but but first of all, I want to commend you on being in such a good mood
*  You are here relatively unscathed. It seems after last night the beating you took
*  On the manning cast. Oh the manning cast
*  How's that you meant Celtic Clippers? Which beating are you talking about? It was both. That's what I mean
*  It was it was a double dose and it was like, you know within a couple hours of each other
*  Um, you're here your bright eye to bushy tailed i'm i'm pleased to see it
*  But it was not fair the manning brothers two on one'd you I mean that was kind of unfair
*  Listen, that was the only way they were even it was going to be an even matchup
*  I was just glad I was able to point out all the people that got held on the helmet catch was the highlight
*  It was fun to do though. I enjoyed it. Those guys. I mean the rewatchable as the helmet catch was kind of inspired
*  That's pretty good. Yeah, I enjoyed it. They did a good job
*  Let's get elia out on the golf course and let's take all this money that would be fine with me
*  So you don't care about payback some literal payback you don't care about these dumb trophies
*  They just created I don't adam solver just seems like he's trying to suck up to
*  People and I don't get it the george miken award for most improved player
*  The fuck is that you said everybody gets a trophy. We are in the participation era like literally everybody gets a trophy
*  I do wonder you made a great observation. What are they going to do about lebron?
*  You can't not have a lebron trophy and it needs to be one of the three or four or five most prominent trophies
*  What did they set aside for lebron?
*  Are they gonna rename one of these did tin duncan get a trophy yet?
*  I still have him as the seventh best player of all time. He's got to be like what did I do?
*  I would five titles, but look, you know what's going on here. The regular season is irrelevant
*  We're going to talk about how irrelevant it is as we go through this list today
*  And you know, they got to do something to create some emphasis on regular season performance
*  And have some kind of recognition
*  The nba needs to pop up and wave its hand to remind everybody because god damn the nfl
*  On christmas the nfl like it's nfl until february
*  So anything for the nba to steal even 10 minutes of the headline. I understand what they're trying to do
*  I think they should have just had 30 trophies
*  The steph korey shooting trophy
*  Lebron james durability trophy. Let's just keep going and going house is here because I worked on an nba trade value list
*  For a while and I kept updating it every week and I think we're going to publish it on the ringer.com
*  Maybe next week that's
*  Yeah, we're getting close. This is we bring you in for the pod when i'm like really trying now
*  I need like a sounding board. I put a lot of time. I've really thought about it
*  We used to do this way back in the day on espn. So it's been a tradition for a while
*  The fun thing about this there's a bunch of fun elements with this trade value list. One is that we have more players
*  That made the list the list is bigger than it's ever been
*  There were years at espn when I think I just did 40 and it was like a chore to get to 40
*  I think we ended up at 50 at some point this year. We have a 70
*  And it's to me a legitimate 70
*  You could even talk to me in the 75 and I think it speaks to things that we've discussed in the pod before
*  the league's super deep
*  The older stars are able to just play longer and you have
*  The lebron chris paul kawaii these guys who are in double digits with their seasons are still really relevant
*  And then we've just really hit the jackpot with some of these rookie classes with the exception of johnny davis
*  Um, but how dare you yeah, sorry house. Well, you took a manning shot of me. I took fire back
*  but it just feels like we're
*  Really loaded and even this draft class
*  There's a lot of guys I like like I had honorable mention people like dyson daniels
*  nemhard
*  Um jalen williams on okc. I caught him one night and he looked like he's gonna be really really good. So
*  Um, it's deep but it first question for you is top 70 too many
*  Should I cut back? Am I being is this a participation trophy trade value list?
*  Well, there's a little bit of that vibe because of the inclination to put first year and second year
*  players on
*  um based on what we've seen with you know, especially for the the the brand new players, um, your keegan murray's your
*  uh, now, I mean I have no argument whatsoever with with matharin but uh, jeremy sochan, you know,
*  Sochan whatever so so hands i'm gonna get these names wrong 50 times nemhard like what's the sample size?
*  so
*  the trade value game
*  speaking of those young guys
*  Comes down to simple questions. Would you rather have four years of this guy or 10 years of this other guy? Would you rather have?
*  You know josh gitty on a rookie contract
*  Or would you rather pay 50 million dollars a year for bradley bill?
*  Like house's team is doing currently right now you're one of a five-year deal. Would you rather
*  pay
*  You know jaylen brown 25 million a year. Would you rather play jimmy butler 45 million dollars a year stuff like that?
*  You have to factor in the salary cap. You have to factor in ages
*  How long you want to have someone on your team and where it gets really hard is the guys like kawaii leonard
*  Who I went to see last night who was the best player on the floor in the celtics quipper game?
*  And had a real edge to him him and paul george were like, oh you guys are the best duo
*  Don't count out the old guys yet kawaii went at him. I had kawaii
*  Spoiler alert. I have them 70th on the list and I debated honorable mention versus 70 just because he's got this crazy contract
*  He's played less than 6 000 minutes since 2017
*  I don't want to do it know what to do the kawaii but after last night. It's like maybe he's 30 spots too low
*  He is it's true and this is part of the conundrum of doing it at this point of the season which is
*  on the one hand understandable because you're trying to
*  Capture the moment of the first quarter of the season
*  But on the other hand in this diminished relevance of the the regular season
*  Moment that we're in it's tough separating some of these guys out and I get the conundrum kawaii
*  Is not 70th on this list. He's he's much much much much
*  Much higher how many more games of the regular season is he going to play will he play another 40 games? Do you think?
*  I don't know. Well, i'll tell you this I
*  Two weeks ago
*  You could have told me he shouldn't be on the list and I think it would have been a fair thing when he was like
*  Oh, my knee's still bothering me
*  Actually, i'm not ready yet. It's man. This guy's been hurt for 20 months
*  Watching him yesterday and I was glad I went
*  Because there's stuff you pick up on in person like there's physicality and just like the way he's moving
*  Even stuff like the way he's walking when there's free throws
*  He looked healthy to me. I gotta say I I actually thought he looked 100
*  I went to wizards clippers on saturday night and I agree with you and he didn't even really have to do very much
*  In terms of extending himself. He didn't go at I mean, I think he was fine with the kuzma and the denny obdiah
*  Matchup, he wasn't quite as revved up. Yeah, as he might have been for the jalen brown jason tatum
*  Matchup and the clippers were in control of that game the whole way
*  It was the john wall home homecoming game, by the way nice moment for john wall. Everybody got up and clapped for him. Um, he
*  I thought it was a little excessive when he started screaming. This is my city like make round three make round three john wall once
*  For it's your city
*  Washington's won some titles and made some finals. I don't know if they're impressed by your one round two appearance
*  I saw last night with john wall
*  You know that clippers team is deep and scary and we could talk about them another time
*  But they brought him him and canard together and they played really well together and they played with speed
*  Anyway, that's it reminds you of the the john wall skill set which is guys in the corners catching balls with him
*  You know drawing the defense in and getting open shots
*  Like how he made a bunch of guys a bunch of money from that skill set and he still can't shoot
*  Okay, so what we're gonna do is we're gonna go back. We're gonna work backwards
*  I'm gonna mention all the honorable mention toughest omission guys
*  And then we're gonna go down. I separated the trade value guys into into
*  Um 13 tiers that we're gonna go through and this might change by the time we publish
*  I'm gonna try not to step on the piece too much
*  honorable mention guys
*  That we had i'll just i'll i'll just go and stop me if you get super excited about any of them
*  Um alex caruso on a very cheap contract
*  Is a real trade piece. I think he's like nine million a year wendell carter
*  um, you could argue
*  Carter for vooch straight up is probably a trade orlando would make at this point. He's hurt though your guy poor zingus
*  Trade asset 20 and 8 every game
*  washington
*  Three games away four games away from the very worst teams in the league, right? Which way should they go?
*  Which way should they go possible trade asset seth curry's expiring great shooter dylan brooks nice cheap contract 12 million
*  Lou dorch just signed an extension really good 3 and d guy, but a little expensive
*  kaminga
*  Yeah, who you could talk me into putting on the list
*  He's tapping into something the last couple weeks. There's a little bit of an edge to him
*  There was a play in the golden states healthic game when
*  All of a sudden he was like I want to post up jason tatum and the words are like this is a great idea
*  You should post him up
*  And he went at him tatum stripped him he kept going and he dunked it on tatum's head and had a little face after
*  I was like kaminga. He's like 19 20
*  So he's on there your guy sohan sohan
*  rj barrett
*  who
*  Barely even deserves to be honorable
*  Mentioned he's been pretty spotted this year keegan murray who I almost stop on on rj barrett. Yep
*  I can't find julius randall anywhere on on on this entire list, you know
*  He should be in the toughest of missions. So i'm going to add him. Well, I I don't think he should be omitted
*  The nix 14 and 13
*  Just finished a four game
*  On a four game winning streak and are the sixth seed in the east as we tape this podcast right now
*  I have been a prominent critic of julius randall. I believe that he sabotaged the nix
*  Last season and that there was an attitude issue
*  going on he's been
*  Excellent this year. He's a 22 9 and even more importantly a 46 percent shooter from the field
*  He is he and brunson have a thing
*  And that that that's important. I mean, you know
*  I I think the nicks are
*  In the mix for the balance of the season if they can stay healthy and they are definitely
*  An interesting player in the trade market. They are going to be looking at these guys out here
*  Um good that we're in on the honorable mention list in the toughest omission list. I wonder if they're
*  Looking at your guy biel
*  Oh, I would god I would welcome that. I just don't you have pack jump unpack
*  Which help drive a couple drivers stuff from us to new york not enough assets coming back from the nicks
*  Yeah, randall's 22 9 and 3
*  He's shooting 46 this year is 41 last year. Yeah, there's a case. I'll look at that his contract
*  23.7 this year 25.6 27.5
*  It's a going rate pretty solid. You're right. He has a real case
*  I'm gonna mark him down
*  See
*  Sober house a good asset to the final trade value list
*  um
*  More people I liked from honorable mention bones highland
*  Yeah, and then fred van vleet just hasn't been that good this year and he's getting paid a lot of money
*  And I think if I had done this list in the summer, I think he would have been on the list
*  But I don't think he deserves to be
*  So there you go another potential trade asset
*  toughest omissions for me sugs
*  Who rookie contract and he's shown flashes
*  Robert williams who has a great contract?
*  We just don't know if he can stay in the court if he shows he can stay in the court for the next two months
*  He's on the list
*  I love jared vanderbilt on utah
*  And he's on a cheap contract and you could argue you'd rather have him than go bear
*  Have you seen dyson daniels on the pelicans at all?
*  Not only have I seen him
*  I was really praying that he was going to be around when the wizards drafted this year
*  Um in the most recent draft, I thought he would have been a terrific, um
*  Defensive addition to the team. He just plays hard as a mother effort and it's unbelievable that he's on the pelicans
*  He the pelicans are quickly becoming the most fascinating league past team, especially with how zions playing
*  Daniels comes out and he looks like he's 25. Yep
*  I he might end up being on the list by the time i'm done
*  I really like the way he carries himself and you're right like he defensively he's already there
*  Seems like he's fun to play with
*  and i'll be interested to see
*  How he evolves for them whether they're gonna be able to find enough minutes for him because they're a contender. That's that's the problem. Yeah
*  draymond green
*  He's player option for next year. He's been really good the last month, but
*  He did punch his team man in the face two months ago
*  So I thought have we have we finally hit the expiration date on that joke?
*  No, it's not really a joke. I mean we have it they're playing better after tonight's game
*  Let's see if it's if we've hit the expiration date because the warriors are playing the bucks the warriors are two and eleven on the road
*  Straight up that's not against the spread
*  Yeah, and they but but what they did to boston on saturday night and and what I think they're they're intending to do tonight
*  And a lot of it comes down to clay
*  If they show out tonight against the bucks or and and possibly even beat the bucks
*  Then I think you know that that's it there we can put the punch behind us. That's my contention
*  Um kelden johnson on the spurs
*  Sure, it was like a very quiet 20 a game. Yeah
*  Jordan pool who just he makes a lot of money. He's 30 million bucks
*  Jalen williams on okc. Have you seen him? This was a
*  Jonathan shark's favorite shout out to our guy. Sure. Yeah
*  um just
*  Okc just putting together this position this weird basketball team. That's super fun nemheart on on the pacers
*  Who just looks legit and has already had a couple like holy shit moments made a game winning three against the lakers destroyed the warriors
*  I forgot to put them on the list. I sent you but uh, I forgot to put devin vas devin vasel on there
*  Yeah, um on the spurs who sure I watched him over the weekend. Um
*  Um, just sintonio beat somebody on the road and maybe it's miami
*  And he made all the biggest shots down the stretch, but he's another 3nd guy. He's as advertised
*  randall
*  Uh zoo bots on the coopers just a unique guy like yesterday in the seltzer game. There are a couple moments where it's like fuck he's
*  Five feet from the basket. We don't have any size. He's got a cheap contract
*  and then uh
*  and then finally my guy malik monk who I think's making like seven eight million a year and it's just like
*  If you're talking about heat check guys off the bench and you're looking at jordan clarkson and jordan pool and hero all these dudes
*  Monk at a discount is a pretty good deal
*  Okay, so any any any of those guys on that list other than randall you think has it has a case
*  Well, there there's an omission that um, it should be a tough omission and i'm not even joking
*  I could I didn't see bowl bowl anywhere
*  Bowl bowl these deserve to be
*  Somewhere in this wow bowl bowl
*  Yeah, you're doing this. I almost got my game worn minute bowl jersey to put up over my right shoulder
*  I I wish I thought in honor in honor. I I really i'm not even kidding
*  I think bowl bowl deserves some kind of recognition
*  in view of
*  Where the magic are?
*  That team that's coming together
*  And the potential that they have they're in the wemby sweepstakes like yeah, this thing is getting now we me you and racilo
*  All jumped on the magic as an over candidate and they had to win 27 or 28 games
*  You know, we we might get there with that though. Well, have you they've been hanging in some of these games like they're
*  Right now their record is
*  What are they they are?
*  eight and twenty
*  But if you go through the games
*  They're they're always hanging around at the end of games
*  Like and they beat the raptors they beat the clippers in ot recently, but they played the bucks hard
*  I don't I don't know that they're they're in the mix night after night
*  I think we might be able to get that unless they start sitting guys
*  Well, I think a big part of that. I mean, uh palo's been hurt a little bit
*  So that's that's another aspect of it. But let me just go through some of the bowl bowl case. He's shooting
*  What do you let me just ask me? I don't know if you have it up in front of you
*  What do you think he's shooting from three? I thought he was wasn't he like 40 percent
*  He is 40 percent. He was over 41 percent a week ago and he's missed a couple since
*  He's shooting 60 from the field
*  and our boy koc
*  Last week threw out a stat about how effective he is
*  Uh on on offense. He's an efficient iso scorer
*  Yeah, the top you know like eight percent of iso scores and he also because of his handle
*  Is among the league leaders in unassisted?
*  Field goal percentage he doesn't need a pass to score from both the three-point line or from the field
*  Both this is an amazing bowl run. He's 23 years old
*  Yeah
*  So there was one video that somebody had he's averaging at 12 and seven this year
*  I know there was one video that somebody had about him versus wemba nyama
*  Where it was like the same? I think it was a tiktok video
*  I think my son showed it to me where it was like wemba nyama getting a rebound and going down the floor and and bowl bowl
*  I gotta say they look same kind of weird bodies and everything. But yeah, all right. We'll have bowl bowl
*  Yeah, let's add let's add bowl bowl
*  Sarudy and clark will kiss us for it
*  Oh, orlando's got something good going. So you think rando is the one guy we're gonna mark down?
*  Well, I I think he deserves he's okay. I put him way well inside the top 70 to be honest. Okay. All right top 70
*  I'm not going to read the names of the tiers. I'm going to save that
*  for the piece
*  But this is uh group m
*  There's four people in it
*  All of them are expensive
*  Number 70 kawaii lennard number 69 chris paul number 68 zack levin and number 67 bradley beal
*  And the question is with all these guys for the amount of money you're paying
*  Where are you going short term long term?
*  Right kawaii the coopers they traded so many picks for him
*  They're not they're not going to shop him
*  But if you're another team would you want them and after you watched them the last couple games, I think you would
*  chris paul
*  They couple moments in that second new orleans game which I watched where he looked like the old chris paul
*  Especially he had a big big shot in the last five seconds
*  But for the most part his stats are way down his field goal percentage is way down eye test
*  Doesn't look like he's I would say rounded in his shape yet and makes me nervous zack levin
*  They gave him that big contract and he immediately got hurt and he had turned out his knee was bothering him since the spring
*  He got surgery has not looked the same and then your guy bail is just too expensive for what he gives you
*  so
*  I think that we need to split this category up because
*  The value of kawaii and chris paul
*  is to
*  Those teams ability to win the nba championship both of those guys are on teams that have
*  Championship ambition and aspiration
*  And then what the teams are paying for
*  Is is that run that playoff run into the title zack levin and brad biel are overpaid?
*  They are your classic example of guys the old nba mistake where you pay
*  Non-superstars as super duper stars. I'll never get over the brand biel. I would say it's all sports. Oh sure
*  It's a classic like oh, we don't want to lose this guy and then all of a sudden
*  Yeah, the way the cap operates like, you know signing a guy like bradley biel
*  Who's made one all nba team a third team one time in his entire career?
*  And he's within five percent of of the value of the contract that uh, uh,
*  Nicola jokic has the joker like that that's that's a problem and and that's what that's that's the cardinal sin in the nba
*  Well, and then on top of it
*  He's taking that contract
*  Because it's the most money anyone can offer him
*  And that's really the only reason he's taking it. Otherwise, he would have left
*  He doesn't even seem that happy to be there right now
*  Well, yeah, there there has been some fun conspiracy theories here in washington
*  He had a very convenient hamstring injury three games before john wall's return back here to washington
*  So he didn't have to be on the floor
*  for uh, you know the the the dc crowd
*  Doing what it did for john wall now. Look, that's a conspiracy theory
*  It does conveniently fit a lot of my beta biel. Um kind of personal animus
*  I think he's a wonderful guy. I just don't you know, it's not his fault that the team has grossly overpaid him
*  But I mean it's colossally
*  uh
*  It's not overcomeable. It's a hurdle that you're stuck with anyways the kawai kris paul
*  They go somewhere else zach lamine and brad biel are your cardinal sin
*  Over you know, I think you're right bumped. I have a category later
*  And i'll spoil the category group j is called. Sorry. He's worth way more to us than to you
*  That makes sense both of those guys were initially in that category
*  I think when kawai started missing games again during the season and chris looked like he did
*  I moved him out of there, but I should move it back. All right
*  Next category. This is uh group l
*  And this is basically a bunch of people who were just quality starters on good contracts
*  so well i'll split them up because there's a lot of people in this category, but
*  Number 66 to number 60 in this category cj mccallum
*  kow kuzma tyrese maxi jeremy grant
*  damarda rosen jordan clarkson
*  and tyler hero
*  So one at a time mccallum's had
*  A pretty lousy shooting year and he said he's been sick and he had like minor injuries and stuff
*  Um, but they he's a big part of what they're doing. Yeah, it doesn't matter. He's the mayor of the pelicans
*  Got to have a mayor
*  Kuzma's got a great deal. He's 13 million a year. He's a great trade piece for them
*  I don't even know if you'd want to trade him, but he's really turned into an asset
*  I mean you could argue him just for westbrook straight up would have been a great trade for the wizards
*  He's in every other game guy. Um, he doesn't have the consistency yet
*  But when he showed I mean he had 25 points in the first half against the clippers on saturday night
*  Like he he can get it going and he can start going
*  Downhill he's still I I would love to see him
*  with um an adult
*  Uh developed point guard who could help him to figure out how to put the brakes on a little bit
*  And the one thing with kuz I would like to see also a little bit more is a consistent effort on defense
*  But yeah, great contract and you know an asset
*  You didn't expect to like him like you did
*  You're right about that. I mean, you know, what what did we see?
*  From the laker years. I mean it was also the same kind of consistency. It looked like he was going to be an unfulfilled promise kind of guy
*  He works his ass off. Um, and you know, he's he's trying to fulfill his promise. He's on his way. I think
*  I think he was screwed a little bit on the lakers team because
*  He basically is the exact same position as lebron. Yeah, lebron's not going to play out of position
*  So kuzma there was trying to kind of fit him into these
*  Other things now in the wizards. He's the right guy. Uh maxi is
*  64th
*  You could argue he should be higher. I don't know. He's putting up stats. He's on a rookie contract
*  I can't say he's a lockdown defender
*  well
*  until the injury
*  You know when the when hardin went out it felt like there was a possibility
*  for maxi to step in and start making the case for
*  You know most improved player
*  That he was going to get all the run
*  Uh, and then he got hurt and and now he's in a little bit of no man's land here
*  Which is why I don't really quibble with with where where you have them, but
*  Yeah, he might be a little undervalued there
*  He's on a weird team where it's like embita has the ball or harden has the ball all the time, which is
*  It would have been more fun if he was just like the point guard on orlando
*  Just playing with those guys playing with the two forwards and doing stuff
*  I think it's around the right spot jeremy graham. I did not expect to have on here
*  But he's been just really good on portland really good those reps that he got in detroit all those uh
*  Scoring reps have really helped him and that was a pretty good trade all the way around
*  He's got a good contract too. He's only I think 20 million this year free agent
*  The rosens number 62. This is like how crazy this list is. These guys are good players. They're not even in the top 60
*  Um the rosens this year next year like 28 29 million range
*  professional score
*  I assume they're going to blow it up pretty soon and he will be available and vuch will be available
*  You can probably get kobe white caruso will be a great trade piece
*  and uh
*  The rosin will be a fun one. There's no player quite like him
*  He'll be the end of some sort of breed of shooting guard after he's gone. That'll be it
*  Clarkson I was shocked that he made the list
*  And I was shocked that I almost felt like he should be higher because when you watch those utah games
*  He's an awesome crunch time guy. Did you have him in washington?
*  No
*  You jordan crofford you never had jordan carlson
*  You should have had jordan carlson and signals got crossed
*  um
*  I think he is I don't have any issue with having him on the list since we're sort of through the first quarter
*  Of the season and this is capturing what we've seen he he to me that it's a will hardy
*  Award he gets if we're naming trophies where there should be a will hardy trophy and will hardy deserves
*  You know really resuscitating the career of lori mack marketing and jordan clarkson and you know, uh, not not necessarily
*  Kelly olynyk is a valuable trade piece that all of a sudden again after bumping around a bunch of teams like
*  This is clark clarkson
*  May make sense ultimately for wherever utah ends up because he's he's still pretty young
*  Um, but he also might fetch back. Um some some decent, uh trade assets at least one good asset
*  Yeah, I think this is part of the trade value game
*  He's 13.3 this year and he's 14.2 next year, right?
*  So you could pay him that or you could pay jordan pool of 31 million dollars jordan pools
*  I think a slightly better player is younger
*  But if I can have clarkson for less than half the price
*  I'd rather have that it gets tough with the next guy hero
*  um who I have at 60 because
*  um
*  I do heroes 22
*  There's moments especially like you just feel like he's gonna score 10 points in a row when your team's going against him
*  There's a ceiling with some of the stuff he's doing that's pretty high
*  And i'm interested to see what's there five years from now. I don't know what's there five years from now, but I think it's
*  Going to be more than what we're seeing
*  Well, we have to root for it
*  Miami has to root for it. Yeah, Miami definitely has to root for it
*  Um, all right. So now i'm gonna get away a little bit from I don't want to spoil the
*  calm too much
*  I'm just going to give
*  I'll do a hodgepodge of 59 to 52 and you'll have to guess where we had them ranked
*  um
*  Four centers are in here
*  Deandre Ayton subonis go bear and alan
*  Wiggins is in here
*  Dearon fox brunson marketing
*  In some order not to spoil it too much for the for the listener, um anybody in that list jump out at you
*  I um
*  I'm having a hard time with rudy go bear being on this list at all. Let's talk about it because I
*  There was another category with that zac lavene bradley bill category
*  I was thinking about putting there or put him on a convention. Here's the problem
*  Minnesota gave up so much for him
*  That whatever value he has for them. There's a saving face piece of it
*  Saving face piece of it
*  That I don't know how that translates to what he would be worth in a trade because nobody else in the league would have him
*  even close to what they
*  Paid for him last year and and them trying to save face now
*  And I just don't know what he's worth
*  I don't think we had a situation like this before because this is already one of the worst trades in the history of the league
*  Let's let me make a recommendation and this is a category that we didn't really run through but it was one of my
*  Absolute very favorite categories of this list, which is dishonorable mention. We didn't go through
*  Oh, I forgot to do dishonorable mention. I know
*  My bad. So yeah, my bad listeners dishonorable mention was kairi harden ben simmons and russell westbrook
*  Now first of all russell westbrook no longer dishonorable. Yeah, maybe he takes yeah, let's take him off
*  All right. Yeah, good point. You're off russell westbrook good teammate trying hard agree invented himself as a six man
*  Great job by him. You're right. Great job by russell westbrook. So he's no longer I would put go bear there
*  But the dishonor really isn't his although his inability to get along with teammates
*  Seems to be traveling with him
*  you know there's been rumors about his ability to get along with teammates and
*  You know, we've we've seen the clips of him
*  um with minnesota waving frantically for the ball in the low post and
*  And getting it and not succeeding and his teammates showing body language
*  Unfavorable body language perhaps is it because he's french or is he not fun to play with I
*  I can't tell there's a there's there might be a personality thing. It's hard to say we don't know
*  I mean, I'm not it certainly explains why donovan mitchell lost the ability to play defense last year because the life had been sucked out of him
*  so
*  Dishonorable mention now look the dishonor belongs really to minnesota not not to go bear, right?
*  I think he's on the list. I don't think they would trade him. But maybe maybe I just put him on the back
*  So then one of them is the thing then you know, what what would the the case be?
*  Like what would the the team the perfect team for go bear be?
*  You know, I've changed my mind. I'm just going to do the the rankings in order
*  For the listeners, I think it's stupid to have ambiguity. It's too hard to do
*  We had brunson 59
*  brunson
*  Hey turns out he's good at basketball. Oh
*  Oh, I knew that already I watched the playoffs last year marketing
*  Discount dirk. Yep
*  Doesn't seem like a small sample size anymore. This has been 27 games
*  Well, I I can't call him the finished bhargnani anymore. You cannot cannot he's too good. He's really good
*  Bargain, he might have been good in this era of the of the mba by the way, you know
*  I stand by bhargnani. I I was a
*  I had a lot of bhargnani stock till the bitter end
*  I even kind of semi defended the next trade for him
*  He averaged 20 a game one year in toronto like it wasn't like he he wasn't darko
*  No, he was not darko. I think the league he you're right. He was probably six years too early
*  Now he's just like kelly olynyk basically
*  At darren fox 57
*  He was not on the list before the year. I think I think subonus has really really had a dramatic impact on him
*  Dramatic team. It's like I think it together the chemistry of it and he plays really hard. He always played hard plays hard
*  It was always a little misguided and then in the last three minutes. He always made you a little nervous
*  But I think that's gotten better
*  Then I had the four centers in a row at eight and
*  Jared allen who's basically 10 million dollars a year cheaper than eight and go bear who we moved and then subonus has the best
*  of that group and
*  subonus this might be
*  He might be 10 spots too too low here
*  Sure, because he's been a borderline dominant offensive force. They run their whole offense around him
*  and uh
*  I've been really impressed. That's a really fun team
*  Are you able to watch them because you're on the east coast?
*  You've probably not seen a lot of kinks some of the west coast night late night. Obviously I have the package
*  Um, so i'll i'll click on as long as I can stay awake, but you know me i'm i'm old so I can't stay awake
*  Yeah, you're snoring. Yeah, I am
*  and then wigs on the kings
*  Wigs at 52
*  Just earned it after the playoffs last year. Yeah, I get it. This is really fair salary
*  It's a reward 25 million for his finals performance
*  Them locked up for a couple three years after this one and I think for 3nd guys. That's a really good price
*  Next group is the upside gang
*  There's five
*  Jaden ivy herb jones shade and sharp
*  Ben mathurin and jabari smith number 47
*  That's from 51 to 47. These are all young guys on cheap contracts with a shitload of potential and herb jones's case
*  Is somebody who it can be on a contender right now playing crunch time?
*  I think there's a reasonable case to be made and our our silent partner in this our our anonymous consignierie
*  Made the observation
*  You could flip these two categories, right?
*  These young upside guys
*  You know what you get out of the quality starters and there are some great contracts in amongst these quality starters
*  Even with how cheap the the upside guys are. I mean, I understand the upside guys
*  So this is the trade value game, right? It's like would houston trade
*  jabari smith for
*  Jordan clarkson. No
*  Would they trade him for tyler harrow? No
*  Trading for tyler harrow no marketing now, they're at least having a meeting then we get to like sub bonus
*  Maybe they consider it. That's why it gets good
*  I value the upside for this game more than the quality guys, but I I hear your point
*  These guys are all cheap upside guys, but
*  You know, who knows if any of them are going to become all stars whatever we know what we're getting in the other group
*  So it could go either way
*  Okay, i'll tell you this much
*  Going one at a time ivy physically
*  I think he's 19. Yeah, I don't know what he's going to look like four years from now
*  And we don't know what's going on with kade and what he's going to look like four years from now
*  But physically that backcourt is going to be a problem
*  That is not a slender backcourt
*  That is those are two like making those are two
*  Two
*  Two athletic strong
*  physique guys and that's I remember like nash
*  I think i've told this story asking nash when he was playing who was the hardest guy to play
*  For him and he said baron davis
*  Oh, sure, and I remember being like baron davis. He's like
*  Yeah, it's like going like trying to basically tackle running back for two and a half hours
*  the physicality with baron
*  You just felt it after the game. I think with ivy when he matures and cunningham
*  That's just going to be like fucking beast of a backcourt. Yeah. I mean, what do you what do you make quick aside of of?
*  Uh piston shutting down kade the shin shin surgery is out for the season. It's a wemby play
*  Rossello rossello kind of winked at this when he was on my pod
*  Okay, like last week there's been some rumors about I don't know. Is this bad the shit?
*  I gotta say the shin thing is terrifying. Yeah, that brings me that brings us back to like sam bowie shit from 40 years ago
*  Oh, no, you know science is better now the medical science. I guess but you're talking shin tibia like
*  There's a pretty unusual injuries that may be nervous. I don't I don't think it's a shutdown yet. I don't
*  What no he said there he's out for the season
*  He's getting no, but i'm saying I don't I don't think it's a wemba nyama shut down. I think it's like right for the pistons
*  Yeah, because if they if they were in shutdown mode, you've got to trade bug donovitch tomorrow
*  And tomorrow I well, I agree. He's got to get that fucking guy off the team. I agree. He's he's a really valuable asset
*  Yeah, get him out trade him
*  So ivy I like that pick herb jones. You've heard me talk about him on the pod many times his defense
*  You like his work?
*  I really love the pieces on that team. It's so funny a year ago
*  A lot of people including myself were just torching griffin
*  For the moves right zion was 300 pounds. They blew the lanzo thing
*  They signed davante graham. It seemed like they had no plan at all and it just was like a catastrophe
*  He nails that draft
*  They get zions head back into it makes that really smart mccallum trade gets larry nansen into who's a professional
*  signs mccallum
*  In this current draft gets dyson daniels
*  Doesn't give up any of their assets like he went from I thought he was doing one of the top five worst jobs for
*  Magyam to now you would put him in the top five for everything. He's done the last year and most important
*  They re-engage zion which is by far the most important thing out of any of it
*  Well, and let's also I mean and alvarado. I forgot alvarado. He deserves the criticism for hiring stan band gondi
*  yes, he does then deserves the praise for
*  Will agree for that for fixing that mistake. Yeah, he did he fixed it in a year
*  Yeah, like this is a big mistake i'm fixing this so good job by griffin. Yeah number 49 is shaden sharp
*  This is a little bit of a deep cut league pass. I'm not sure how focused people have been on like second quarter portland games
*  There's an athleticism with this dude and you could go go on youtube and just google like shaden sharp highlights
*  Something's different about him
*  There's a hang time thing with him that is
*  Really really really unusual and I don't know where it goes. He's he's taller like he's kind of kobe's height
*  But he's bigger. He's six six, but he's a little bit bigger
*  but he can kind of hang around around the rim up in the air in these different ways and
*  Really really special but also like I like the way he carries himself. I like his three-point shot
*  They they might really have something with that dude
*  Yeah, it's interesting you you put a guy like this into this list and you look at all the names behind him
*  And people will say that you're this is absurd. This is you know, a classic the port i guarantee the portland fans will not think it's absurd
*  But here's here's some telltale in addition to the athleticism you're describing
*  The guy, you know has has played in uh
*  26 professional basketball games. Yeah, and is shooting 47 from the field in his 20 minutes of game
*  Yeah, and
*  You know over 30 from three
*  He's ready to play nba basketball. He is playing nba basketball
*  I mean I look at the guy that the washington wizards drafted and where i'm going to stop doing this
*  But the comparison between what's shaden sharp looks like as a potential nba player and daniel
*  So you were just like a pick late, but then unfortunately durin's good
*  Uh jaylen williams aj griffin is the one aj griffin. Yeah
*  So the thing was sharp six million a year basically they have him for four years
*  and
*  I I don't know man. I
*  What I value in basketball if you listen to all the pods and red me really is
*  It's it's always the same right to watch this dude. Who's 19?
*  Who had this weird kentucky season last year and he comes on this team and the team's good
*  And he's already figured out how to get his 20 minutes a game and play pretty well and have some moments
*  I think that's so much more impressive than if you're on a shit team playing 30 minutes a game putting up stats
*  So much more impressive than if you're on a shit team playing 30 minutes a game putting up stats
*  Like he's already navigated how to matter on a good team or a decent team
*  If kentucky hadn't been the kind of team they were last season easy case for him as a potential number two overall pick
*  I mean, I know
*  Uh chet did what he did and we saw gonzaga on the big stage if we had seen more kentucky
*  And we've seen you know what was going on
*  With that that team on the on the stage I think there might have been a case for shaden as as number two overall
*  I have a great comp for him that i'm not going to say in the pod. I'll save it for the piece
*  Number 48 ben mathurin
*  Indi indiana
*  I'm just pronouncing his name mathurin. I listen, you know, I have the speech dyslexia thing
*  He's just a guaranteed 20 to 25 a game like you know where this is going like worst case scenario
*  He's just going to put up 20 to 25 a game. He plays with real energy
*  He seems like he can play any style
*  I think he could fit on 25 teams in the league and be an asset in some way
*  and that was a great pick and then the last one on this list is jabari just because
*  First of all real signs of life the last couple weeks
*  um
*  just an unusual
*  Size he can play the three or the four
*  He guards already he plays real defense which doesn't really have have him fit it on the tv side now unfortunately, but um
*  You can see it. I I certainly don't think there's no bus potential with him at the very least and
*  I think there's a pretty high ceiling you have you seen him yet?
*  I haven't seen enough. I mean, I haven't gone out of my way to watch a lot of houston
*  Probably a good move
*  All right. This next group is the aforementioned. Sorry is worth more to us than to you
*  And this is where I think we're going to put kawaii and chris paul back in
*  And then after that 47 to 41 was jaron jackson og and anomi
*  Marcus smart de jante murray chris middleton lebron james and jamal murray
*  so
*  One at a time jaron jackson
*  The only reason he's not higher is there's been some health stuff with him
*  And he was weird in the playoffs last year
*  And I and he's young. I mean, what is he 22 23? So I
*  There's some ceiling but he's also like he might just be a guy who's just like a 16 and 6 guy who blocks some shots
*  I don't really know yet
*  Good contract is like 25 million a year. Um, it's right around the range right you you quibble
*  No, only
*  I think the ceiling is higher than than you you're giving him credit for I think the defense
*  Could be you know game changing but the the important thing is that he stay healthy
*  He needs to be on the floor. He needs to be on the floor in the playoffs
*  this memphis team
*  um
*  and
*  It's just uh remains to be seen. That's all okay. So this is right around the range
*  Og and anobi I did not have in the top like 60 but defensively he's just been awesome this year
*  Yeah, and like really really went up. Oh now the toronto fans are like he's been this good for the last couple years
*  I disagree
*  I think he went up a level. I think they're I think he's a slightly different guy this year that team
*  I don't really know what's going on with that team something's missing and I can't put my finger on it
*  It's an ongoing thing with them. You know, they have nine guys that are six eight
*  Right and and you know, they're they're tried they tried they've been trying this experiment for a couple seasons
*  And they're right around 500 last year. They were kind of in the same spot at this point in the season
*  Then they went on
*  a run
*  um
*  And a lot of it had to do with scotty barnes. I mean
*  I I I don't know what's going to change
*  Uh for them to get them clicking but they're not clicking yet
*  So an anobi and barnes and two number ones for durant
*  Does does kd want to go play in toronto probably not after they cheered when he heard his achilles but um
*  Who hangs up faster for that one though?
*  The nets
*  Okay, I think you're right the way barnes has played this year number 45 mark is smart
*  Just awesome contract and a guy that we know can be in playoff series
*  Out there for 35 40 minutes guarding everybody and a ton of experience. There's really nobody like him even yesterday at the cooper game
*  He guarded kawaii. He guarded paul george. He guarded john wall. He guarded luke canard. There's nobody like him
*  44 to jante murray who?
*  Is as high as he is only because of his contract. It's still still cheap contract. He's like 16 million bucks this year
*  Unfortunately, he drew the short straw. He has to be in trey young's backcourt
*  I don't it hasn't gone awesome
*  It is a real conundrum that atlanta situation
*  Yeah, is a mess
*  And I don't know whether or not we're going to get resolution to it this season
*  They might like just end up being the seven or eight seed
*  In the east and knocked out in the first round and then use next offseason to try and fix this but
*  They got some issues
*  Murray's stats are pretty similar to last year
*  Except his assists are down
*  By three and his rebounds are down by three
*  But all his shooting stuff is the same the points are the same
*  Shooting a three-pointer even better which makes sense because he's playing with trey now
*  The uh the usage is down a little bit, but not as much as I expected
*  um
*  Um
*  In general, it's a weird combo
*  And i'm not sure
*  They had all these other moves to make before they made that move and even though the price was pretty fair
*  But now they're in this john collin situation and then bogdanovic would do with him
*  I don't know. They it seems like they have three trades left. Um
*  Chris minnleton lebron and jamal murray. We don't need to talk about them. Those are all key guys
*  I do want to talk about lebron
*  You're really going to have him
*  Up here in the 40s
*  Well, he's he's been in the league for 20 years he makes I know I got 40 plus million
*  He can't even be traded this year and
*  I don't know how many teams would actually want to trade for him
*  Because you have to assume he'd want to be happy to be on your team every team. So that's
*  Every team would want to trade. I'm sorry like no like
*  I don't know. Memphis isn't trading for lebron james. Like it would have to be a big city
*  And he's not going to only tell a anyway, it's too risky
*  You can't trade for lebron and then have them not want to go to your team
*  well that that that much is fine you wouldn't do anything without his consent, but
*  He's still at uh, you know for for for every kind of measure we use
*  For for this artifice
*  He's still in the top 30 top 25
*  It's lebron
*  All right, so hold that thought the next group
*  Is a bunch of young guys lamella ball chet homerun kate cunningham scotty barnes jaylen green and josh giddy
*  That's absurd
*  So you're saying the teams that have those guys would be like, you know
*  It would be a great idea if we traded this guy for a year and a half of lebron james under the circumstances under whatever
*  The circumstances are of course, of course, of course, of course. So you think lebron should be higher?
*  Sort of in like the mccale bridges range
*  Yeah, at least the mccale bridges range. He's 38 years old. He's played for 20 years
*  He's the most important player in the league
*  Yeah, you might be right. I I was so fixated on the age, but then
*  There's this thing this week about
*  He wants to play somebody was saying he wants to play till he's 45. Do you see that whole thing?
*  I guess he wants to do the brady. Oh god. Is he going to do tb12? Is he going on the program?
*  I don't know. I I can't believe he's played this many minutes
*  He's only kareem has played more minutes than him at this point. So good. All right, i'll move lebron up. You've convinced me good
*  That next group lamello homerun cunningham barnes jaylen green and giddy
*  So i've giddy is the best person in that group from an asset standpoint. I would add cunningham, but the cunningham shin thing
*  Chet same thing lamello. We've never seen him on a good team now
*  Right at some point i'd like to see that scotty barnes fell
*  I think when I did this right before the season I had him like in the low 20s
*  You did I just haven't been that impressed by him this year. I don't know what happened to him
*  There's still time. We're only a quarter in this is why win us back scotty barnes
*  Yeah, well that that's what I the thing we were talking about with og like with with toronto
*  It's kind of a mess right now. Somebody's got to come forward because paschalsiakum has been great
*  And then jaylen green and giddy see this is like I just don't think
*  Houston is trading jaylen green for lebron james. That's an idiotic trade. Why would they do that?
*  20 years of jaylen green for a year and a half of lebron for what reason well this version of houston
*  Also, if the lakers didn't do that, they should have their head examined because he's beloved because he's beloved
*  That's why because if lebron james is is playing home games in your city every game is a sellout. That's why
*  For like a year and a half so what it's worth it
*  I would love to see any houston fans reaction to we've traded jaylen green today for lebron james
*  New plan wemba nyama out. It's lebron sangoon and jabari smith. We're going for it. That'd be insane
*  I don't disagree. I just we have to come up with a way for lebron to be properly recognized in this thing
*  Jaylen green this will be the last time I think him and giddy. This will be the last time they're not in the top 30
*  Yeah, i'm fine with that jaylen green. There's been enough flashes of
*  him being the creator in a game where they're going toe to toe against somebody good and he's
*  Clearly belongs as like the foil for whoever the other team's best guy is the she he's still not hitting threes
*  I wanted him to get to in the 40s with threes. He's pretty far away and then giddy
*  Giddy's a delight. We would have loved to play with giddy. Oh awesome giddy
*  When our holy cross runs giddy would we would be like, oh giddy's in the gym
*  Okay, let's get on giddy's team. Yeah, we love you're gonna get touches
*  You're gonna get great touches in great spots great
*  Spots that's fucking massage place
*  Does that need an edit no josh giddy bob craft was caught at josh giddy's last night
*  That's a good name
*  The next category is just like the
*  Elevated winning asset category. So you're saying lebron's in there. I'm gonna listen to you. We'll see what america thinks at least
*  Got mckell bridges number 33
*  We know you can win with mckell bridges
*  Right. Yeah, you're making a face. Oh only here's my problem
*  I can't get over
*  I still haven't unseen what dallas did to phoenix last year in the playoffs and mckell bridges was a big part of
*  What dallas did to phoenix last year in the playoffs?
*  He he he disappeared. It was a disappearing act. He is a terrific terrific. I mean, it's he's a winning asset
*  They won 64 games last year because mckell bridges is a winning asset
*  And you know, they they're they lost their last four games in a row
*  But you know the nice start that they've had to the season again mckell bridges nice regular season guy was luca who's
*  The single hardest small forward to cover
*  Probably since lebron and his peak
*  I get it one thing with bridges incredible contract 21 this year 21.7 23.3 24.9
*  so you're basically paying a 40 million dollar guy half of what he's worth, which is
*  Which is where you want to be in the trade value list
*  Anthony simons just bullied his way into the top 35
*  We were waiting and we were waiting and we were waiting
*  We watched a lot of games of anthony simons on portland and portland
*  You know trying to prop him up and then he wasn't ready had to pull him back down
*  And they tried to prop him back over the last three seasons. They tried, you know, and and here he is
*  And he I think you know what it is
*  We had our guard up because portland's tried to do this to us before with people like rudy fernandez
*  Great point great point all these people who would be these awesome assets and never made it but
*  I watched he had that 45 point game must have been like a week and a half ago where he also made it was I
*  Think was against utah
*  Where he also made the two best defensive plays. Maybe that was saturday night
*  um
*  He's a dead eye scorer. He has these runs where he just like feels like he's
*  Scoring for five straight possessions. He plays really nice with dame
*  He'll have everyone so while have like a six point box score
*  You're like what happened that night? But for the most part that's right and really good contract 25 million a year basically for
*  Somebody that every year has gotten better. So love him
*  I was worried. He was a good good stats bad team guy
*  But he's not he's not
*  And neither is this next guy franz fucking vogner man
*  You know the the orlando guys are going to insist that we redo
*  Rookie of the year last year we're talking about the 2021 2022 season scotty barnes won rookie of the year
*  That franz should have won there. We're going to hear that for the rest of his career
*  And as he gets better and continues to to you know, reveal to us what he's capable of
*  We might end up agreeing
*  The words to commingo
*  We're already down on scotty barnes for christ's sakes the words took commingo over him and we both like comminga
*  But after watching vogner on this orlando team, it's really hard for me to imagine
*  Vagner wouldn't have fit in perfectly
*  On that golden state team like fucking perfectly in related news. Bob meyers is waiting on a contract extension
*  Yeah, what was that story?
*  So suspiciously timed right before the first abc game of the year and it's like who's up for some gm gossip
*  Wait, so does have a contract yet. It's fucking december
*  And to me that seemed like he wanted to float it out there for the lakers
*  He went to ucoa. I felt like there was some lakers
*  Stuff in there as you know, I always try to figure out the agenda when this stuff comes out indeed
*  anyway franz vogner
*  I think he could be a 25 points a game guy pretty soon like in a couple years. It just depends on
*  How orlando evolves? I mean there are they have three guys that could be 25 point guys
*  You it's the it who's the third guy
*  You're not gonna say bobo. Are you?
*  No, no, I I
*  I think like wemby or something. Oh lottery pickaxe. I got you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
*  Yeah, it's funny about franz and palo it's kind of what we grew up with remember there were these teams that had
*  You know denver had alexander alex angus and kiki van de wey at the same time
*  It's like look at these guys one guy's averaging 27 the other guy's averaging 28. How does this work?
*  Uh, it feels like a little bit like that where they could just like go off with these two dudes
*  And they play well together. I actually like how they play number 30 desmond bain
*  Who unfortunately got hurt right as he was having his official coming out
*  Party as an awesome awesome
*  Awesome player one of the things with him
*  he has
*  A ludicrous contract. He was the 30th pick in the draft
*  So this is year three for him
*  And he's making a whopping
*  2.1 million dollars god and then next year 3.8
*  And if they wanted they could have them for 11 million as a cap hold in 2025 but uh ridiculous value
*  Ridiculous value
*  proven playoff guy and
*  I think somebody that could be one of the three best guys on a finals team
*  I don't think he'd be the second guy, but I think he'd be the third guy. I like that
*  I'm willing to concede the third guy. I'm willing to contemplate that i'm not giving
*  Because he has the single most important skill
*  In this league in this version of the league the way basketball right now
*  Can you make a basket when you're staring at the basket and the answer is yes, you can do you can switch with him on d?
*  He showed some creation stuff this year we talked about with verno a couple weeks ago like they were
*  Able to initiate the offense with him, which I just wasn't expecting. I didn't think he had that in him
*  so he's on there and then the last guy on this list who
*  We can have an argument in one second, but uh, daris garland
*  who
*  Just like hit the lottery
*  And by the way, he's great anyway, but I mean to have mobley and then mitchell
*  And this is just like these are your two guys now with jared allen like that
*  That's just like what better situation for a point guard and he's a real point guard
*  Where did we have garland on this list a year ago that that's not this high
*  He was like in the 40s. So this is the point you just made is the right one
*  Which is donovan mitchell basically grabbed him by the shorts and pulled him down
*  Not didn't pull his shorts down but just pulled him down into this kind of rarefied air
*  In terms of a trade value space top 30 trade value we have him at 29 in the deepest year we've probably had
*  Yeah, yeah, he's so he's 8.9 this year
*  But then he signed an extension
*  And the extension was for five years 194
*  Which is the only reason I didn't have him higher than this because he is going to be making money
*  What I love about him is how unselfish he is and I actually think he'd be fun to play with
*  I think he's like a little bit of an old school point guard like he'd
*  His perfect game is like 19 and 9
*  And he hits one big three in the last three minutes and just moves the ball and keeps keeps a certain speed to the game
*  He's kind of point guard. We don't really have anymore. Well, we the only knock on him is he needs a scorer
*  He I mean, this is why cleveland didn't go anywhere in the playoffs last year, but I don't know if he's that guy
*  You're right. He's he needs a scorer. He needs a score. Yeah, yes. Yeah, you're right. Well, he got one
*  Right. He did and and he gets to play with evan mobley
*  He should just he should handcuff his leg to evan mobley's leg when they're not playing together
*  Just to make sure evan mobley doesn't go anywhere. I just be like I I am your tony parker
*  Take me with you wherever you go
*  Next category has two people
*  One of them is trey young and the other is carl anthony towns
*  They're in this group
*  Because I don't think they're available
*  But I also don't think the team hangs up if you're calling about them
*  That they're both very
*  tough players to project
*  now now trey did at the
*  Very early in his career drag a team
*  In into playoffs. It was a super weird playoffs. He did they got to the third round
*  But and but he did that he did it 29 a game and we we all loved it and he
*  acted like he belonged he won big games on the road and
*  He talked the talk and walked the walk
*  The problem is it doesn't seem like he's that player
*  He can do that every night on a regular season basis and maybe you don't want that from him
*  So then what's the situation which is why I think it was pretty
*  Smart of atlanta to bring in murray
*  Because it's an insurance policy between bakdanovich and and and murray
*  You know, they're they they've created kind of a safe place an insurance policy to trade trey young
*  Well to to to let let's really see what version of this team is best
*  Is it with trey young or not now that whatever the coach thing is?
*  Has to get since there's two coaches in a row that
*  There's been some weirdness with they also they're the number one team for me if we're doing the
*  The olympics for bad body language this season atlanta is either a gold medalist or a silver medalist
*  You catch them on the wrong tonight. You're like, oh what's going on?
*  I I what happened is there a fight at denny's last night at two in the morning. What's going on?
*  That the the john collins signing remains
*  Uh somewhat confounding because it feels like then it leads to the herder trade
*  Which is like herder's actually somebody who could be in a playoff series free
*  I don't even know what position john collins is and and he continues to be in in trade rumors
*  Yeah, what was the point of it? What were they doing? Were they helmet hamstring? Did they have to do it?
*  They couldn't get anything for john collins new owners
*  And then towns at 27
*  Look statistically
*  Looks great
*  Awesome basketball reference page he had one of the dumber playoff series i've seen against memphis
*  Which we talked about in this podcast a lot just very bizarre
*  Up and down strange decisions in the fourth quarter. He's hurt now
*  Doesn't fit with go bear
*  I think that's
*  Even a more bizarre combo when we talked I don't want to rehash stuff. We've already talked about in the pod but um
*  Has a huge extension coming
*  Is the other piece of him? That's the problem
*  and
*  It's even kind of worse than the bill thing because
*  I don't even know what your outs are. So if you're minnesota, you're going to be basically paying
*  in 25
*  2025 50 million
*  26 54 million 27 58 million
*  And then he has a player option in 28 for 62.062 million
*  Which i'm pretty sure he's already good at exercise
*  Yeah, um right now he is uh at 33
*  Million and he can't be traded until july
*  Oh, he has a 10 trade bonus. So if you trade for him, it's 10 higher than that
*  He 28 might be too high for him or 27
*  You know
*  He really shouldn't be on the list
*  He doesn't have trade value
*  He's well, that is he's 24 and 12 a night. That's a poison pill contract. But if you're like charlotte you're
*  You know, I don't know
*  So you can get to the second round of the playoffs
*  There's like four franchises
*  Where he would make sense
*  And it and it's in that category. It's it's the charlottes and the washington's of the world
*  He would make perfect sense. He'd be great in washington
*  Beale for towns done. I think you have to throw in something you're throwing in something else
*  Nothing not anything good
*  You having a root for towns would be one of the funniest things that's happened since i've known you
*  Talking yourself into him towns was unbelievable. I like what are you talking about? I would immediately talk myself into it
*  uh next group
*  First time in trade value history been doing this idea. I think since like 1999 or 2000
*  The 14 chance for victor wimminyama
*  Is number 26 on this list the rights to any probable top five pick. It's like 14 14
*  12.4 percent and like 10.3 percent something like that. So
*  just
*  An above 10 chance to get wimminyama is the 26th trade asset in the league right now
*  It's crazy valuable. You can't even joke about it
*  I know you're making a joke. I know it's light. It's not a joke
*  It it is it is
*  franchise altering
*  It is you know your your contention trajectory. It's everything
*  All right, so top 25
*  This guy might move back let's talk about him number 25 brandon ingraham
*  Back in what direction what do you say back should he be in that kind of
*  Where simons and franz wagner are like in that 30 to 32 range?
*  Because I don't think cleveland would trade daris garland for brandon ingraham. I just think I have them like five spots too high
*  Yeah, I don't think minnesota would trade towns for him
*  I
*  Kind of do
*  You do?
*  Yeah
*  Maybe I miss reading
*  Minnesota I mean minnesota is impossible to get a read on
*  I think i'm gonna move him back five spots brandon ingraham
*  Also like uh, I don't I I don't think
*  Orlando would trade franz wagner
*  for brandon ingraham
*  I don't either so that that's a perfect spot for him
*  There was they put him so i'm gonna move him back to the low 30s do you like brandon ingraham?
*  I do wonder though
*  If the pelicans look at this and really start to wonder if you put kd in that brandon ingraham spot
*  Can you win the title?
*  But could you actually win the title with the way zions play now with your role players?
*  Could you just say fuck it? Let's let's actually win the title the west is still open
*  That's super hard kd is is a is a true conundrum because the the thing I would be worried about as the pelicans is
*  Chemistry, right and whether he's happy in new orleans. What have we seen out of kd over the last half decade?
*  It suggests that he's like go along get along
*  Stability of long-term stability and just happiness. Yeah, you're right
*  The better off probably not doing anything this year
*  But the ingraham spot with all the picks they have they could upgrade into somebody in this 20
*  The rest of this group
*  This is group e
*  Pascal siakam paul george dame lillard donovan mitchell drew holiday and bam out of bio
*  I admittedly rank colladay too high
*  I just feel like
*  As i've said a million times like I want guys who I know can be guys that I can win a title with
*  Win a title and we've seen him now in too many playoff series. He's too destructive. He's too good defensively
*  He checks every box in the olympics
*  We fucking love drew holiday, so uh one at a time siakam
*  What remember you mean was we didn't we do like we said he was the worst contract what a what a run for siakam
*  2022 a roller coaster ride ever since then tell us to stop it to stick it up. He really did. He's been great
*  his contract
*  I think is pretty reasonable. I'm calling it up. He admitted that he had an attitude issue
*  He had to get on the same page he had a bad offseason they they
*  Uh, he had a little bit of an injury and then they all got on the same page
*  Right around the time that we did that podcast with right
*  and he's been a a menace
*  he uh
*  35 million this year 37 million next year
*  Fair and he has he has some bonuses if he hits
*  If he hits uh, oh and be a second team first team shit like that too, um
*  Paul george number 23
*  I think he's in his early 30s now huge contract
*  But you watch a game like last night where they're bringing against the seltes like, you know, who's good to have on your team paul george
*  The six foot eight guy who could shoot threes and handle the ball and play defense and can't really can't be defended like, you know
*  There are there 96 of the league can't really defend him
*  Especially the regular season
*  I think he has
*  The the most or the second most third team all mbas
*  Feels right. I don't know if that is that pull that thing up. Uh, yeah, he has the most third team on base ever five
*  It feels right. I joked on twitter that adam silver was gonna give out the third team
*  On ba trophies are called the joe johnson trophy
*  Uh-oh, and I looked it up. I looked it up. He only had one third team on ba joe johnson paul george had five
*  Well, it's the paul george trophy the paul george trophy the third team on ba trophy. That's not even a knock
*  By the way
*  If you're the best if you're one of the 15 best players in the league five times and he was first team on ba
*  So six times he's been one of the 15 best players in the league. That's not nothing. Let's go
*  Like uh
*  I was looking at some of the other ones reggie miller and ray allen people like that
*  Oh, I think people think are among the greatest players of all time
*  And ray allen was like one second team one third team. They're just great shooters. They're that was you know
*  It's not a knock to say that they were incredible shooters. Yeah, vince carter
*  One one second team one third team
*  That's right. We know that we watch it with our own eyes
*  Tom chambers two second team on ba's these were all really good players alex english
*  He was three second team on ba's that's one second team all mba too high for tom chambers germaine o'neill
*  One second team two third teams. Yeah, but anyway paul george putting up six pretty good. Yeah
*  damn
*  Huge contract
*  Massive just ridiculously expensive. He's in the 50s
*  In the 50s
*  And with an extension, but then he had 11 threes last night
*  And he's I mean he's healthy. He's good. He we were worried
*  He hadn't seen him healthy in like 18 months, but he's shown enough. I think
*  The last six weeks that I feel okay, and I feel okay having him top 25
*  Also one of the rare guys who means a shitload to his city. That's it
*  It's it's he's synonymous with portland. It doesn't matter what the contract is
*  He had so many opportunities
*  It was reported that he was interested. He was like those reports are all garbage. I'm never leaving. I love it here
*  I'm staying
*  I'm the guy here. I love what's going on. I'm gonna make it work and that's yeah, I want to win a title here
*  It's great
*  Holiday 20 and then bam out of bio 19
*  What about donovan mitchell? Oh and donovan mitchell 21 good comeback for donovan mitchell
*  I would not have had him in the top 25 before this season because we hadn't seen him play defense since
*  Before the pandemic this and guess what guess what he he knows how to play defense and he has long arms
*  And when he's really engaged with this team, it's like oh cool donovan mitchell's a two-way player again
*  So why wasn't he engaged with this team?
*  This is why I think it's not far-fetched to put rudy gobert into the dishonorable now
*  I'm off for blaming rudy gobert for anything
*  So you like that order dame 22 mitchell 21 holiday 20 out of bio 19, I mean
*  I don't know what the defining bam moment is. I'm not sure that I could point to like oh bam
*  You'd move them back. Yeah, what's what's my defining?
*  Where where is the they've had a lot of success with that dude? Yeah. Yeah, yeah
*  Because he's um, you're gonna have no heat culture is gonna come after you know
*  Heat culture, what are you talking about?
*  Heat culture people who every time miami wins they eat culture and then they're like 12 and 17
*  10 how many
*  How many people are on the key the heat culture bandwagon?
*  Who is that you can see him in the stands? There's like at least 12 of them those seats those empty seats
*  One thing with bam
*  Great contract 30.3 this year 32.6 34.8 37.1
*  He's a top five center in the league so I don't want to be misunderstood I recognize
*  I think that's the right spot for him. I think I value him a tiny bit more than you because okay
*  He's I i've had my team go against him for six games seven games in a playoffs
*  He's a fucking bitch to play against. Okay. He really like he that little floater
*  He has he's great at these illegal screens that they never call. He's a really good defensive player
*  I will confess my bias
*  At the end of the all of those games. It's always jimmy with the ball
*  It's always jimmy that you want with the ball. They're not running anything for bam. I mean, you know, he might have some cleanup stuff
*  So that's the bias i'm confessing it heat culture. I i'm i'm acknowledging my blind spot when it comes to bam
*  This next group is three, uh, very young possible franchise guys
*  tyrese halliburton
*  18 anthony edwards 17 and palo 16. Is that the right order of those three?
*  Palo 16 anthony edwards 17 halliburton 18
*  Man, I I would have edwards as close to the top 15 as possible. I think
*  Anthony edwards is just
*  What we we have enough sample size out of him the other two guys not enough quite yet
*  I mean definitely not with palo. We've only seen 28 professional
*  Basketball games that have where he he was even eligible and he's already been hurt a little bit
*  and halliburton
*  You know, he had to acclimate to the to the paces a little bit
*  It I think he's I think he's settled in now. I think he feels comfortable. Jesus
*  Yeah
*  He's so good
*  I really think
*  I I always loved him and I definitely own a lot of halliburton stock
*  I never thought he could be a franchise guy until this year because he's completely changed
*  There's a selflessness to that team and I think he comes from him from him and from carlyle
*  how good of an offensive coach he is but to even see people like buddy healed who
*  Was never like an awesome teammate and didn't seem like that fun to play with and they were always trying to trade them
*  And even he's kind of bought in I don't know. There's a vibe to them
*  I like yeah because the paces are going to make the playoffs at the east now. Yeah
*  Your team's probably going to sell out, right?
*  They they makes they should they have issues. They're they're best
*  Opportunity is to to fight for the 10 so they have a chance to make the play and they're
*  They they're in like the 12 seed seed slot right now, Washington. They have no chance
*  Indiana's, you know 500 puts them right in the mix for you know, five six seven eight
*  Yeah, right now the pacers
*  Are eighth 14 14
*  So really the bulls or the wizards would be the two threats for them. Miami's 13 and 15
*  I can't believe toronto's 13 and 14
*  We thought we did the over under pod. We we thought like high 40s minimum for them
*  They're all they're they're on my lock list if you look it up. I still think yeah, I I have them
*  I spent a lot of money. I invested in
*  Getting over 46 wins because I thought that win total
*  Was low I I thought they sorted out that six eight wing, you know
*  They have all these guys that are between six eight and six ten
*  And that they'd sorted it out last year
*  I think part of the problem might be van vleet and I would love for them to get another shooter
*  I want them to be a buyer in the upcoming trade market. I don't know who they they could get I
*  It would have been a kevin hurter, but he's not available. Yeah, it's never going to be available
*  I
*  Want them to get a shooter they need somebody who can knock down threes
*  It would be a nice thing to see from from scotty barnes
*  It's not his game. Yeah, he went he went backwards this year. So we'll go halbert and palo edwards
*  Just quickly on palo. Wow
*  Wow
*  Talked about him already on pods, but jesus nba guys just size and speed
*  Yeah, like you don't usually see the six ten guys with like a first step like that
*  It really comes easy to him just way
*  Way better as a rookie than I expected from him. All right, the next group has five people
*  jimmy butler
*  jaylen brown anthony davis
*  shay gildedges alexander kevin durant
*  There's some some some shockers all the way around here now
*  butler is
*  incredibly expensive
*  so
*  if
*  So when when you hear that list you're like wait, why is why is jaylen brown a better trade asset?
*  than jimmy butler the answer is
*  jimmy butler's contract
*  And I think he's 30
*  He's 33 years old
*  37.6 million this year signed extension 45 48.7
*  52.4
*  In
*  2026
*  Jaylen is jaylen's 25 million a year
*  So he's basically almost half the price of jimmy butler and butler's already missed 10 games 10 out of the 28 games
*  Jaylen's way more durable and they've had pretty much
*  similar playoff success jimmy's a little higher because of the finals, but you know jaylen was
*  boston's most reliable player in last year's finals, so I think
*  When you throw in the age jaylen's
*  Eight years younger than jimmy butler. I don't think that's an argument
*  I wanted to make an argument for butler to get pushed down a group or two. Yeah, you can't he's you cannot you can't
*  He's got to be in the top 15. He does I mean he's just he's a he's a one-of-one as a playoff dog
*  So then people would argue well, why isn't lebron higher than?
*  If we're doing the playoff dog thing which was your argument you made before yeah, I argued for it
*  I think lebron should be higher
*  Yeah, it's tough because
*  No, he's that he's not in this tier, but it it speaks to your lebron argument
*  I think the lebron being in the league 20 years just I think threw me off with the ranking i'm gonna put him lower
*  Jaylen brown 14 davis at 13 davis was
*  Right in that trey young
*  Uh, he was in trey young spot next to town in that weird group as the hey any interest
*  Hey any interest
*  But he's been kicking ass and they're finally learning it play with speed with him put him around the rim a little bit
*  He's a little more engaged defensively. He's been really good good contract, too. He's only got two years left. I want him
*  To drag them into what what what what seed is the right seed for the lakers to exceed?
*  Expectations good question. Is it is it a five seed?
*  No, they they're not getting there they're already they're 11 and 15. They're they have so much work left
*  But they they they started the season like you know with only two wins
*  new orleans memphis denver
*  In phoenix
*  I just think are going to get to 50 plus wins probably right those four teams
*  The only one that's vulnerable there is phoenix then you get sacramento portland
*  Clippers dallas gold state well clippers see I would put clippers in where you have phoenix and I would have phoenix in the
*  I just don't know what i'm getting from kawaii, but yeah, I think
*  I think the lakers are going to be like a nine or a ten seed
*  And if you go through the all the teams that list they basically have to take the spot
*  Of sacramento portland or utah just to get in that top ten. That's not that's not you're not you think well
*  Utah will probably phase out they sure are
*  And then minnesota is kind of lurking too
*  I asked that question because I wanted to to know
*  How often?
*  I ought to be doing small increments on anthony davis to win the league mvp
*  If over the last 40 games of the season
*  The lakers he he is the the animating force the energy behind them getting up to that
*  Let's let's do that that five seed territory
*  You know, I don't think they're they're not going to jump over phoenix, but they're like six seed, I guess maybe
*  So i'm not allowed to bet on this but we love talking about it
*  Davis is still 35 to one god
*  Like I just want to do seems off. What was he last week?
*  Because you and I talked about this last week too less than 20. He was like right around in between
*  um
*  16 and 20 to 1
*  I might have got him even a tiny bit of 24 to 1 tatum's the favorite of plus 270
*  I
*  Out of the long shots, I can't believe i'm saying this but yokich at 27 to 1 is great value. No chance
*  I'm not doing it anymore
*  Denver is good though
*  I know but people will not do yokich the other one that I think has to be considered as davis at 35 to 1
*  I mean, i'm sorry duran at 35 to 1 just because brooklyn's 17 and 12
*  And there's a world in this season where they just win 55 games and he averages 34 a game
*  I I don't even want to say
*  What's gonna happen because we know what's gonna happen. Yeah, we know it's gonna happen. I wouldn't bet that I wouldn't bet that
*  I don't want to screw it up
*  But well, not that that that's not even the risk proposition. It's it's kevin durant plays 55 games a season
*  He's not eligible for these for these awards because he doesn't get the requisite
*  To the rexwood threshold and I don't even really think he should I do think it makes sense for him to rest
*  For him to be for him to be prepared right just get get in the tournament
*  The guy that's going to carry the water for them if they really are going to do it is ben simmons like that
*  He's the guy i just throw up in my mouth
*  One more 35 to one shot for you
*  zion williamson
*  I don't want to do anything. I don't you don't want to talk about this. I don't I don't know
*  It's like we're at a blackjack table. We just want some hands and we're like, hey, so how about those bets?
*  We
*  We don't want to change the dealer we like the dealer that we have at that blackjack table he looks
*  Amazing. He not only does he look amazing. No, i'm not talking about his basketball
*  I'm talking about as a physical specimen, but i'm talking beyond the basketball beyond the physical specimen
*  He's got his fuck you back
*  I didn't know where his fuck you went his fuck you was gone for two years the windmill dunk
*  It's my favorite thing. He's making my favorite moment of this whole season
*  He's demolishing dudes and he's making the fuck you face after and he's like looking over the bench like this
*  Do you believe that guy tried to guard me like yeah, there's like he's like
*  Seeping fuck you. Yeah, I I love it so much. I miss him. I missed watching him. I'm so glad he's back
*  But those two phoenix games, which I watched as much as I possibly could have both
*  These teams didn't like each other
*  The sons hate alvarado. Do you see that little elbow chris paul whipped at him?
*  It's so good
*  They were talking shit in the court and zion was like basically bully balling them for two games
*  He was like you got fucking guys get out of here. It's what he's what you said is 50 gallons of fuck you right there
*  I loved it. It's terrific. Yeah, nobody's allowed to bet on zion 35 to one. Let's pretend it's not happening
*  I I hope a prayer continues, uh, davis 13
*  Sga at 12. What a miraculous run for him and he just keeps doing it. He's still still crushing it and um
*  Outrageous how talented he is he can take he is he deserves he's right where he belongs
*  Top 12 can take over any game that he plays in and be the best player on the floor
*  And you need to see it. You need to watch him do it. He he literally
*  I mean he's a top 12. It's just a top 12. I don't I mean I can't go beyond that
*  You know philly could have drafted him
*  Who'd they take instead
*  mchale bridges
*  And then they traded mchale bridges for zair smith in a future first the philly the philly fans
*  That's one of their they'll never get over that. That's never get over it
*  Tough one and then durian at number 11, which is basically around where he's been for us. That's fair. That's all season. Yeah
*  All right, we're down in the top 10
*  Separated in two groups
*  The untouchables and the completely and utterly untouchables
*  Number 10 joelle mb'd
*  Fine could win the mvp this year if he stays healthy
*  He's doing like the early 2000 shack
*  Joelle and beat had 53 points last night. You're not even blinking
*  And that makes sense because he did it last season. Yeah, he he he he he seasoned us
*  Yes
*  The injury longevity piece with him is always going to make me nervous it just is it just is
*  Zion williamson avid number nine
*  Dramatic
*  If it was like if they had when you can look at stocks and the stocks go up and you look at facebook
*  It's like whoa or netflix. Whoa netflix was at 680 now. Oh and then it went down to 180 now. It's at 300
*  That's been zion stock the last like five years and might be bitcoin
*  Now that's that's insulted in zion
*  He's more he's more like uh, it was over 65 000 a coin
*  Hey, but now you wouldn't want it
*  I'd want zion
*  I don't know what stock he is maybe
*  Tweeted house tell him tell him what stock zion is
*  Holy shit, though
*  I'm just so glad it really seemed like it was over a year ago
*  Maybe i'm too cynical as I get older
*  But when he put on all the weight and he's wearing the sweatshirts, I thought we were done
*  We didn't think it was over
*  It's just we couldn't you can't see the way to him getting his head right because i'm an over as like an impact
*  superstar that kind of over so giant fat guy with a foot problem
*  Not very encouraging. Yeah, look at it
*  Oh the foot problem that that I shouldn't have had him back by christmas and then it was trade deadline
*  And then it was the whole season and we kept seeing pictures of him being a giant fat guy
*  Yeah, it was not encouraging. So i'm with you. I don't disagree whatsoever
*  And the thing that that is such a wonderful
*  Uh development is somebody got in his ear or maybe his own self. He just grew up. He's a kid. Maybe he grew up
*  He's like I am going to stop eating 22
*  All this terrible food and i'm just gonna get lean and what I really love to do
*  And I think he said some of this in some of these interviews
*  I love to play basketball and go kill people on the basketball court
*  And I think he he confessed that he lost that desire a little bit over the course of the previous year
*  And now he makes the fuck you face again
*  25 7 and 4
*  He's shooting 61 percent
*  And he's shooting 36 from three now he doesn't make a lot of threes but
*  When he shoots them during these games, I think they're going in sure
*  That's a great shooting percentage for a guy his size with with his skill set
*  Two years ago. He was 8.7 free throw attempts. You know, I love free throw attempts
*  This year 7.7 and climbing sure. Yeah
*  the thing with him
*  It actually reminds me of uh, Tyreekill
*  Like there's just nothing you can really do
*  You can throw the multiple guys at him
*  He's out there. The other team is just concerned the entire time. There's moments when
*  Like the little like not fast breaks, but like the semi-transition when it's like four on three
*  But all of a sudden you realize he's got a head of steam
*  Get out of the way and you can see the other team like fuck. Yeah
*  That's good him and Embiid
*  Just physically
*  And Giannis would be the third that we have these three just fucking specimens this year that are just like can get to where they want
*  And then Davis when he wants to be like that. So I have nine
*  Now we could argue about having Mowgli here at number eight
*  I'm admittedly I own the most Mowgli stock. I am the biggest Mowgli super fan there is
*  The reason I have a mate in Zion nine is because I just think Mowgli
*  Knock on wood. I'm gonna knock on everything
*  Like I think it reminds me of like the Duncan and KG like these guys that just they seem like they're built for these
*  100 game seasons 90 game seasons like he it's just there's an ease that he's going up and down the court
*  All his decisions are easy. He's just low stress. I just feel like he's headed for like 1700 regular season games
*  So I think you do overvalue him. I would put him in that category with Halliburton and Edwards and Paolo
*  I think that's the right class for him and the caliber of player that that he is the sample size remains way too small
*  Yeah, Mowgli and he has the benefit of
*  An unbelievably good stable Cleveland situation, which is a hilarious thing to say not anything that anybody
*  Would have said about the Cleveland Cavaliers up to the last two years
*  And the move 20 21 years old
*  Yeah, I mean that he's 21 and his contract that rookie contract
*  Is impeccable so Zion's on Zion's on already like some form of the extension because he came in early deserved it
*  Deserved it. Yeah, he's on the like the minimum extension still
*  But I mean I the the Mowgli case is is the age and the contract
*  I just think in terms of impact he belongs with Halliburton and Anthony Edwards and Paolo
*  Uh
*  Zion is 33 million and 24
*  It goes all the way to 44 million and 28 which worth it seems super risky when they did it and now seems a lot less risky
*  Worth every penny
*  Another David Griffin masterpiece. Um, i'm happy with being accused of overvaluing Evan Mowgli put that on my tombstone
*  I'm making the fuck you zion face to everybody else. I just value what he does
*  I think I think you win titles with guys like him and defensively
*  He's at a whole other level than zion. That's the other thing like as a two-way guy as a forward as
*  Somebody that can either play five or four you play small ball with them
*  Those things are true. I just love him and he's gonna start making threes about two years from now and that's gonna change everything
*  He's not even you can't smell Zion's jock
*  Offensively talent wise though. I think he's a way safer health bet though
*  Okay, that's reasonable that's reasonable yeah, no talent wise talent wise zion should be in the top group
*  He should yeah he should
*  Number seven devin booker now you could argue this is a whiff too high too, but here's the thing
*  Um best two guard in the league
*  He's won and been either the best or second best guy on like legitimately crazy successful teams
*  And
*  I think he means a lot to phoenix in that area. I thought it was really interesting in telling
*  During the durant trade rumors how that was one of the the celtics didn't do this with jaylen
*  That was one of the only cities where everybody and our guy eddie johnson
*  Was one of them like we're not fucking traded devin booker. What are you talking about?
*  There's no way that trade's happening take take his name out of your mouth
*  It was like one of those devin booker is going to be a retiring phoenix guy
*  So that that makes his trade value a little bit harder to figure out
*  Yeah, I I mean the only quibble I would have is like
*  He's ahead of kevin durant. He's ahead of it
*  He's ahead of was younger than he's like seven years younger than duran. I know I know I know from a health standpoint safer bet than an
*  Embiider zion that's why you can't and he's proving unlike moby
*  So but I listen I will fully admit moby and booker might be too high
*  And you could you could argue m beat and williamson you could flip
*  You can flip moby and booker and you can flip and beat and williamson and we're probably in the same spot
*  Maybe i'll end up doing that
*  Number six is john moran
*  The question is whether he should be in this next group. That's the last group
*  And I went back and forth. I had him where he was in the last group
*  I had him or he was the leader of the second to last group
*  and it keeps coming back to me to
*  to
*  He just makes me nervous how he plays. Yep
*  that's it and
*  I I don't know how else to put it. He nobody no nba player makes me more nervous than him watching him on my television
*  Because he is podcast was it you or one of your guests who said?
*  They just want him to to to subject him to to tape of derek rose to watch derek
*  I was talking about it because I watched this game two weeks ago
*  Where he intentionally missed a free throw and then he just like flung his body forward into three people and it's like you
*  You can't do that. It's oh, it reminds me sunday. We were talking sal and i were talking about debaul samuel
*  and how they use debaul samuel and it's like at some point you're just
*  You're just testing it right after the 28th time you've run him over the middle where he gets hit by four guys
*  Like at some point this isn't going to work
*  And I feel that the greatest thing about jas how hard he plays now reckless he is
*  And it's the thing that scares me. So I don't know whether he should be in this next group or right here
*  But he certainly is it's he's no less important to the memphis than tatum is to boston. No, no, no
*  They're same age. Basically. He's I think he's a year younger every one of these top six have that same attribute
*  Yeah, so I got to think about it some more. I I think i'm gonna end up moving him to the next group
*  But I I want to I want to mow it over more. I got to look at like his games
*  There's only to me one candidate that you would you know flip them with
*  And i'll go through the list. All right, so the last the last five I have tatum
*  curry yokage donchich and yanis
*  Yeah, so I I would potentially flip jaw for curry
*  That would be the only one and that's just a function of stef being where he is career wise and where he is
*  You know how what's the mileage that's left and what makes the most sense for him?
*  In terms of playing over the course of the regular season that that's all like it's i'm not knocking
*  Not knocking stef curry for christ's sakes, but we're trying to split
*  Here I get it
*  this last group
*  I think you forgot the point of this last group the other team's just hanging up
*  You're any jam in the league
*  You're in a gym in the league and you're calling golden state and you're like
*  Hey, I want to talk about trading for stef curry and they hang up and they laugh
*  Why don't you make this group six players jaw is untouchable?
*  Yeah, I think he is I think you're right. He's he's literally untouchable
*  And whether you have him ahead of jason
*  I you can't put him ahead of jason tatum because jason tatum was the best player on a team that that played in the finals
*  And gave golden state a legit, you know challenge jaw's not at that at that level yet
*  And he's been the best player on the best team this season last two games accepted
*  By the way, I was talking to my dad about it today
*  I was like if the southspeet the lakers tonight, they're four and two on the road trip
*  Take it six. All right. So jaw six tatum five
*  I think curry has to be four because
*  First of all, he's still fucking incredible and we have no idea how long he's gonna be incredible
*  But yes, he the connection he has with golden state is the most meaningful player city connection. They would never trade him
*  Not I mean not it's not him or the golden gate bridge who gets traded
*  It's not more meaningful than dame to portland because of the the portland no it is because of the titles
*  Yeah, you win titles with somebody. It's different. Yeah, think about your team
*  You fucking you still love west unsealed and elvin haze and bobby dandridge
*  They won near 10. I have my elvin haze jersey. It's gonna go up over this year
*  The elvin haze is last defender. This is I take down the minute bold jersey. I'm gonna put up the elvin haze jersey
*  So curry for and then the last three are just the best
*  Year to year three guys in the league safest bets yokage donchich and janis. There's
*  It's funny you could make the case that any of the last three could be the first guy
*  Sure. Sure
*  because yokage is like
*  How many years in a row can he just go 25 12 and 8 and be at a 50 win team?
*  um, and then luca
*  Is the youngest out of those dudes?
*  But janis to me has to be number one he's still the league still goes through janis
*  We need another reinvention out of luca
*  We got a reinvention out of him. We asked him to not drink sweet tea and have nachos all summer long
*  Yeah in the in the summer leading up to the summer and he didn't and he played in that euro basket ball championship thing
*  It was incredible in that and he showed up in shape
*  But this dallas team
*  Sucks
*  They're not fun to watch not fun to watch playing at the slowest pace in the entire league because they rely on him so much
*  They're trying not to they're trying to
*  Not have him get tired, but it's I don't think it's good for him. It's yeah exactly
*  It's not and it's not his fault. It's a it's a design problem
*  Um, and I don't have it's funny like you remember this happened with lebron where lebron
*  The first cleveland stretch and he was stuck on these teams where he's basically doing this kobe jordan
*  Iso ball impersonation and it wasn't his fault. It was just the teams he ran but it was like man
*  There's so much more here. When is he being on team?
*  a real team that
*  You know that cuts in his ball movement and it uses like all the pieces of him
*  And then he went to miami and then they finally kind of found that at some point during the miami run where it was and he
*  Got to use all the pieces of him
*  And I do feel the same way about luca. I'm not sure
*  I don't know how many years away from seeing that there's a whole like
*  I just wish they were running more and that he was using like his passing skills and all that stuff and
*  Everything is slow down who could run christian wood could run. Oh god who could run i'm just saying like
*  Look at the the guys on the team. It doesn't even make sense
*  So yanis, I think this is his third straight year as the number one guy
*  Best player in the league as far as i'm concerned. Yeah, I think this goes back to money on him for mvp this year
*  Yeah
*  All right. So the big ones you think you think marianne should move up into the final group?
*  You'd flip edwards
*  with the banchero alabert and combo
*  Mood brandening goes back down. I pushed evan moble down. I'm not listening to that. I'm just telling you that
*  I'm not listening
*  Uh, and you think lebron should go up way higher way higher. Yes way higher for lebron
*  And you think toronto would trade pascal siakam for him?
*  No, I don't
*  Yeah, all right i'll figure it out this is fun it's always fun
