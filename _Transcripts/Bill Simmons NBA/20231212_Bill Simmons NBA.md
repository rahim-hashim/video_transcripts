# Doc Rivers on Trading Shai to the Thunder #shorts #billsimmons #podcast #nba
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [December 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idxcNTQw5_U)
*  We cannot give up Shay.
*  I even told Kawhi when he was saying like,
*  I need another guy, kept saying, you know,
*  Kawhi, Shay's gonna be a star.
*  But how long?
*  I don't know how long, but he's gonna be one.
*  Looking back at that Kawhi decision where he's like,
*  I'll come, but you also have to get Paul George.
*  And you look back and it was like,
*  that was kind of stupid.
*  In retrospect, if you could have convinced Kawhi,
*  come, let's see what we have.
*  If we wanna go get Paul, we can still go get him.
*  Yeah, that trade with 19 picks was gonna be there.
*  Yeah, no one else was doing that trade.
*  So Kawhi was basically saying,
*  if you don't get A, he's gonna go to B.
*  And bombers worried he's gonna go to the Lakers
*  and the Crippers lose out again.
*  They lost out on Kobe in 2004.
*  Yeah, but we couldn't lose to the Lakers.
*  I don't believe in my heart that Kawhi would have gotten there.
*  I think he was coming to us all along,
*  but he had all the cards.
*  He had all the leverage and we had the bite for sure.
