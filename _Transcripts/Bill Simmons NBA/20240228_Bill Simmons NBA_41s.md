**Bill Simmons NBA:** [February 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Euf-67GhbU)
*  Here's a fun Kobe Bryant story. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Euf-67GhbU&t=0.0s)]
*  2008, spring. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Euf-67GhbU&t=1.52s)]
*  We're working on 30 for 30. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Euf-67GhbU&t=3.12s)]
*  We got all these documentaries going. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Euf-67GhbU&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  ESPN separately is doing Kobe doing work with Spike Lee, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Euf-67GhbU&t=5.88s)]
*  which is a documentary following Kobe before, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Euf-67GhbU&t=8.68s)]
*  during, and after our Lakers game. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Euf-67GhbU&t=10.96s)]
*  So they show up for the day of the game. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Euf-67GhbU&t=12.56s)]
*  Kobe won't come out of his house. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Euf-67GhbU&t=14.56s)]
*  He's like, no, get these guys out of here. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Euf-67GhbU&t=16.0s)]
*  They're like, what? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Euf-67GhbU&t=18.04s)]
*  And he goes, I want to make more. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Euf-67GhbU&t=19.6s)]
*  Give me more money for this. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Euf-67GhbU&t=21.56s)]
*  This is too much of my time. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Euf-67GhbU&t=23.32s)]
*  They're like, what? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Euf-67GhbU&t=25.04s)]
*  So over the next like 90 minutes, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Euf-67GhbU&t=26.04s)]
*  his agent quickly negotiates more money for Kobe Bryant. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Euf-67GhbU&t=28.32s)]
*  Spike Lee's there. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Euf-67GhbU&t=32.44s)]
*  Spike can't get him to come out of the house. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Euf-67GhbU&t=33.36s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Euf-67GhbU&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  Kobe got paid. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Euf-67GhbU&t=36.24s)]
*  And Kobe decided to do some work. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Euf-67GhbU&t=38.36s)]
*  Kobe Bryant. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Euf-67GhbU&t=40.28s)]
