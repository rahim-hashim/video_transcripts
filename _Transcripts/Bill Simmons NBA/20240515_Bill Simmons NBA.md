# Another Nikola Jokic Masterpiece | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj85xBFQ1YA)
*  We just watched Yoko throw a masterpiece at us.
*  I don't know.
*  You tell me.
*  I thought after game two, I thought this had a good chance to be a sweep in that
*  Denver was beaten down and semi broken.
*  And this is what happens to back to back teams.
*  So 72 hours pass, they summon something, they figure out something.
*  And from that point on, they flip a series in a way that I only have a couple
*  historical examples of what is the number one reason this happened to you?
*  Cause now they're up three, two heading, heading back to Minnesota for game six.
*  But the series has flipped in the most unusual way over the course of a week
*  that I can remember in a while.
*  Why do you think that happened?
*  I think maybe three different things.
*  So I'll give you three bill off the top of my head.
*  One is Minnesota maybe relaxed a little bit.
*  Two is the greatness of Nicola Jokic and three, I'll place it on our industry.
*  The media acting like Jokic can't play acting like Denver's championship really
*  didn't count because of who they were going through.
*  And they're a team that wasn't going to be able to bounce back and they were
*  diminishing what they did last year.
*  And you saw Mike Malone or Michael Malone use that as motivation.
*  And I don't know how much that played a role.
*  I personally was disgusted in the way that it was covered.
*  And I'm not talking about you specifically because you said sweep, but you gave, I
*  think a pretty logical reason.
*  It was the health of Jamal Murray, right?
*  Murray didn't look good, but other people were coming out.
*  And saying, well, this proves that what Jokic did last year was a fluke kind of
*  sounded like he didn't deserve one MVP, nevermind three.
*  Uh, and that's clearly not the case.
*  Yeah, it seemed, I don't know what happened to Murray last week from game two to
*  game three, but you know, he looks way better.
*  Christian Brown, the last two games has really helped them.
*  Gordon has been awesome game four and game five, but the big reason is Jokic.
*  His computer super brain just figured out how to slow the pace down correctly
*  against the timber wolves.
*  And then today specifically just picked the park go bear.
*  Like it was like, it felt more like a boxing match to me.
*  It felt like watching the superior boxer who, when they show the scorecard after
*  10 rounds and they go to like, you know, Harold Letterman, what do you have?
*  He had a better, I have a 10 rounds.
*  Nothing.
*  Yo kids, Jim, I just think he's dominated.
*  That's what he was doing.
*  He was just killing go bear, the defensive player of the year.
*  I mean, to me, to me, it seemed a little bit more like, uh, like Tyson and
*  Peter McNeely, right?
*  Or it's just like one punch and he goes down.
*  Cause I think it was like over pretty fast.
*  And then like, he wasn't the only people killing it.
*  I'm looking at people on social media and people are killing go bear so
*  bad that I felt bad for.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you and I didn't think this cause I think we've been riding in the front seat
*  of the Oakage bandwagon.
*  And I, I know I've been in my share of like personal life arguments about it.
*  And some people were slow to come around.
*  Some people were begrudgingly admitting how good he was.
*  But then as soon as this Minnesota series turned, like you laid out in the
*  beginning, it was like, Oh, see, told you.
*  Well, who'd he beat last year?
*  Well, go look at the playoff teams.
*  They beat, they didn't beat anybody.
*  Hey, great.
*  Congrats.
*  You won one title.
*  A lot of people won title.
*  We heard all this stuff.
*  I kind of think he needed this to just kind of slam the door.
*  And like if they finish off this Minnesota series, Minnesota series,
*  God knows what's going to happen.
*  But I feel like he needed this in a weird way because people still didn't believe
*  cause he just doesn't look the part of this guy who's this generationally
*  special basketball player.
*  I don't, I don't think people can wrap their heads around it.
*  And yet if you watch it day in day out, this is what he does.
*  He's the most consistent superstar.
*  He's the most consistent super duper star.
*  We've probably had since I don't know what offensively, I mean, even like
*  LeBron wasn't at the level he's averaging 30, 13 and eight in the playoffs now for
*  four years, you know, like this is, this is just, I, you have to go back to the
*  bird Jordan magic era really for any of this.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I've heard you say it before that you think he's one of the greatest
*  offensive players of all time.
*  And like, I can maybe argue that there are guys just as good as him, at least
*  during my lifetime, I can't argue that there's a guy better than him.
*  I wouldn't say there's anybody out there that I would say is definitively better
*  than him to me yet was growing up in the eighties or looking at magic and bird
*  where they got the combination of like, I can score when I want to, but I also
*  make my teammates better.
*  It's curry who kind of did it in a different way by his gravitational pull.
*  And he made everybody better that way as well.
*  Even a guy like LeBron or Luca, who are both fantastic and Luca specifically is
*  a little bit more heliocentric than LeBron, but LeBron's got the ball a lot
*  and doesn't necessarily make other guys better passers.
*  And you saw it when you like grew up watching bird, right?
*  He made everybody else on that team, a great passer.
*  Yoke, it has the same impact where he gets the ball, he gets rid of it.
*  And it's almost infectious outside of maybe Michael Porter Jr.
*  But like, look at the player Aaron Gordon has turned into where it's almost like
*  he's learned for like some of the passes that he made tonight where he finds
*  Yoke, it's curl into the hoop and it's like they're just on the same wavelength.
*  And I think he's he's helped him see the game in a different way.
*  I think he's done that for all his teammates.
*  And I personally think that's what great offensive players do.
*  Yeah. And he brings us selflessness.
*  Now it just sounds like we're throwing Yoke each cool way at each other.
*  But it was it was a pivotal moment at the tail end.
*  Yeah. KCP goes and grabs the ball from him so he doesn't get the turnover
*  because this new stupid thing NBA teams do.
*  Not relatively do when they dribble up the clock and take a turnover
*  because they're up 15 or 29 seconds left.
*  I have no idea why they don't just shoot.
*  But Yoke was about to get stuck with the turnover and KCP ran over and grabbed the ball.
*  So he would get the 24 second shot clock violation.
*  It's like it's a little tiny thing, but shit like that matters to me.
*  That's the kind of stuff you look at when you're like, how tight is a team?
*  And then the other thing I noticed after the game and we've seen this,
*  there's only a handful of guys.
*  And as much as I love Tim Duncan and I ride with Tim Duncan,
*  I think he's the seventh best player of all time.
*  I don't even know if he did this night tonight when somebody is so great
*  during a game that you see the guys walking off and they're coming over to high five them.
*  And they're just kind of like, holy shit, man, like that.
*  They have that look on their face like, Jesus Christ, I'm just honored
*  to give you a high five right now.
*  Very few guys have levitated in that territory where the people on their team,
*  the coaches, the equipment managers, everybody's just like,
*  I can't believe what I fucking just witnessed.
*  Yeah, I think specifically maybe they even do that a little bit more after this game,
*  because I would argue this was the best game of his career.
*  I mean, I think you can make that argument over what the stakes were.
*  Right. And all the heat he was taking, like you got all the critics
*  that are all over his case basically saying like, all right,
*  this is the first time you faced adversity.
*  And Bill, that's like kind of what we love, because I know we're on the same wavelength.
*  It's like you like defending champions trying to defend the title. Right. Yes.
*  And then I also love and it's the reason I was so angry with Durant
*  for going to Golden State is I love to see when a super duper star
*  has his back up against the wall. And how's he going to react?
*  Whereas when Durant went there, it allowed like Curry to kind of pick up the slack
*  or if Curry struggled and allowed Durant to pick up the slack.
*  You never really saw those guys in that spot.
*  They didn't have to be in that position.
*  Whereas Jokic was put in that position. He's down.
*  Oh, too. He's got all these critics.
*  How is he going to respond?
*  First time he's faced adversity.
*  And I think it really is the first time that he faced adversity
*  because two years ago and three years ago, he had the injuries to Jamal Murray.
*  There's no pressure on him. Yeah.
*  Last year, what they go through the postseason 16 and four.
*  There was really never a tight spot outside of two two against Phoenix.
*  Here is really the first time he's faced adversity
*  throughout the course of his entire career.
*  And guess what? He's passed it with flying colors.
*  Yeah, I remember a week ago, I led the I led this podcast with like, hey,
*  what if Minnesota sweeps?
*  What are all the ramifications from this?
*  And the last piece I talked about was Jokic and saying,
*  if he actually solves this Minnesota team, which is the best that defense
*  they played in game two was, I think, the best defense any of us had seen
*  in 20 years since the four pistons.
*  It was like, if he can flip this, this will be the this will be the thing.
*  This will be the thing in his back pocket that you just pull out
*  anytime somebody is complaining about him, questioning him
*  and wherever you want to put him in your pantheon.
*  This will be the first thing mentioned.
*  Oh, 100 percent. You didn't overreact there, too, because Eddie and myself
*  did the same thing on our show where that individual performance by the whole team.
*  But I'm talking about game two specifically, the best defensive performance
*  maybe that we've ever seen.
*  So you put that in the proper context when you were talking about it on your pod.
*  And for him, then, to do that against a defense that's that good.
*  I mean, think about it.
*  He went up against a defense that were comparing like 2004 pistons, 2008 Celtics,
*  the 89 pistons, the 91 Bulls.
*  And he just went out there and had I was the final line.
*  40 points, 13 assists without a turnover against that defense.
*  And Rudy Gobert shots.
*  Yeah. And Rudy Gobert's got the what for defensive player of the year awards.
*  Now, whether you think he's worthy or not, the guy's got four.
*  What is it? It's Ben Wallace and it's it's, I believe, Dwight and it's him.
*  So he's got the Kembe, excuse me, not to.
*  So he's got the four and he does it against him.
*  He does it against them.
*  It makes the performance even more amazing.
*  Yeah. And I still don't know why Minnesota decided not to keep playing
*  like they did in game two, where they were picking them up full court,
*  really pressuring him, harassing him, harassing Murray.
*  I thought that was such a big part of their success.
*  Maybe they couldn't sustain it.
*  They couldn't sustain the intensity.
*  Maybe Denver figured out something that I'm not smart enough to see.
*  I'm like giant TV.
*  But even like today, I kept waiting for Nasri to pick up Yoke edge,
*  you know, because they started pressure, Murray.
*  So then you could you're bringing up and in game two, especially Nasri
*  was coming way up and just like just bothering Yoke edge and trying to get in his.
*  And they just didn't do it.
*  They let him kind of get into the spots he wanted.
*  And the thing I love about his computer brain in this series
*  was he figured out all the different locations on the court
*  that were the best places to attack. Right.
*  Like sometimes he would go high to the right
*  and just kind of see what he needed to see and then kind of attack quick
*  and then do that kind of hurly burly spin double, triple spin movie does.
*  Other times he would just try to post up Gobert
*  because he knew he could back him down.
*  And I thought Draymond was interesting at halftime talking.
*  I thought Draymond was good tonight.
*  He's saying at halftime about like, how is Gobert
*  letting him back him down, back him backwards like that?
*  Like he's the defensive player of the year.
*  Why are you going backwards?
*  But the point is, he just figured it out.
*  Yeah. The only thing I'll say about Draymond is Draymond's acting
*  like he didn't get his butt kicked against Yoke.
*  Like in around one a couple of years ago when you could have any teammates.
*  Yeah. Yoke, you kicked his butt to that's where he kind of hamstring, I think.
*  In the final game of that series.
*  And it was still fantastic.
*  It took him about a game and a half to figure out Draymond back in that series.
*  And then the other thing with Yoke, the two plays that stuck out to me tonight
*  and there's always usually it's past that sticks out.
*  How about the lefty hook?
*  I think that was in the first half.
*  He gives you the lefty hook to be able to do that.
*  His size is just freakish.
*  And then the other one was the righty hook.
*  I think it was over and go bear what he's like fading away into the corner.
*  He throws it high off the glass where it looked like he was off balance.
*  I mean, yeah.
*  So just the, you know, the touch that the guy has on on on every single
*  type of possession is just amazing.
*  I thought I enjoyed Jamal Crawford tonight, but he brought up Hakeem
*  versus David Robinson in 95, which was kind of the iconic.
*  I'm now taking this personally and I'm going to destroy your career
*  playoff performance.
*  The reason I there's pieces of it with go bear Yokeage, but go bear
*  just isn't good enough.
*  He's not in the Yokeage class.
*  The thing, what made the Hakeem Robinson thing so special was Robinson was
*  handed the MVP during that series.
*  And Hakeem just like his eyes narrowed and he famously just laid the smackdown
*  from that point on, this is a little different go bear the best they played
*  in this entire series was game two.
*  And I'm still not positive, you know, now it's like I might be back in on my go
*  bear trade, 210 cents of the dollar.
*  Maybe, maybe I'm back in on that, on that tape, but I just think Yokeage
*  is at a different level.
*  I liked the most when it was Nasrid in towns as the two bigs against him.
*  A hundred percent.
*  Cause Nasrid and Eddie and I talked about this as well.
*  He's a little bit more girthy, right?
*  So you saw what Yokeage is just shoving him right under the basket with Rudy
*  Gobert, Nasrid, he can't necessarily do that to Nasrid is Nasrid.
*  Not the defender that go bear is, but that's something that he's unable to do
*  in regards to like using his weight and with the Hakeem and David Robinson.
*  Yeah.
*  If he's going up against NBD is doing that then yeah, you could, I think, use
*  that reference that Jamal's talking about because NBD is the guy that a lot
*  of people still out there.
*  I think even after this game, unfortunately, I don't know what they're
*  watching are going to argue NBD, but we talked about it on like one of the pods
*  I was on with you several, several months ago.
*  It's like the gap between this guy and everybody else in the sport is as, as
*  it was at any point when LeBron was, was dominating the sport 2013 range.
*  Well, NBD had 70 against the Spurs.
*  He did.
*  That's a good point.
*  Bill, I forgot about that.
*  So I don't know how that compares to the gap is tightened a little bit after that
*  point.
*  That's just, that's right.
*  I forgot about that.
*  I said this on your show, but I haven't said it on my podcast after he won the
*  third MVP and now what he's doing this series and assuming they can finish this
*  off, they'll go to the next round.
*  They're going to play.
*  Okay.
*  So you're Dallas.
*  I just think to me, this is the Western finals, this Denver, Minnesota matchup.
*  I think Yoko is in my top 15 now.
*  And I made the list and I have this whole group in the Pantheon where it goes
*  Hakim, Shaq, Moses all in a row.
*  And they're like 12, 13, 14.
*  And then I had Oscar and Kevin Duran at 15 and 16.
*  And I just don't see how I can separate Yoko from Hakim and Shaq and Moses
*  anymore.
*  If he wins, especially if he wins another title, even makes the finals.
*  Moses had that five year run on Houston and then the last year in Philly, three
*  MVPs won a title.
*  Shaq had the three straight finals MVPs and Hakim for three years, maybe four
*  was out of control, one, two titles and was just awesome.
*  And this Yoko run is as good as all those runs.
*  I think, yeah, so I don't know if you saw it on TNT towards the tail end, they gave
*  it Moses an extra MVP when they were running through all the MVPs, they put up
*  the graph or they gave him four on the graphic and they got magic and bird
*  behind him with with three.
*  Yeah, so he's at three.
*  But no, I agree with you there.
*  And I would also say like the the title, maybe that he won.
*  And I want to give Jamal Murray his credit.
*  And we talked about this on my show with you the other day as well.
*  But he won it with him as a sidekick.
*  Like Shaq wins his three in L.A.
*  He's got Kobe Bryant, OK, who's a top 10 to 12 player of all time.
*  Moses, as good as he was, what did he need before he won his first title?
*  He's got to go to Philadelphia.
*  He's got to team up with with Dr. J.
*  Well, and Andrew and Andrew Tony and one of the best players the league that year.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Kill in the Celtics and no cheeks who, regardless of what you think, should be
*  in the Hall of Fame or not, is still in the Hall of Fame.
*  And Jamal Murray will probably be there at some point as well.
*  It's really easy to get into the Hall of Fame.
*  But like, yeah, the sidekicks that he's won.
*  That's why I don't know where you said you had Durant at like 15.
*  I don't think it's any question that you'll get you ahead.
*  He definitely bumped him.
*  Hakeem won the title in 94 where his best sidekicks.
*  Exactly. That's why it was a hodgepodge.
*  But that was also a pretty weird year for the league.
*  That was the year MJ was playing baseball.
*  Reggie Lewis had passed away.
*  Like we just had we lost some good players.
*  The talent that was kind of between two eras, a little bit
*  magic had just left, Bird had just left.
*  But then the next year he won with Drexler.
*  Jokic, I think I heard I heard you guys talking about this the other day
*  where he's never played.
*  Jokic has never played with another all NBA player.
*  Yeah. So Tom Habistral has this on his substack where he ran through the list
*  of guys through this point in their career.
*  So basically at the age of 28, how many MVPs did the guy or how many
*  all NBA players did the guy play with?
*  How many all stars did the guy play with and how many all defensive guys
*  did the guy play with?
*  And like I think it was within a five or six year radius
*  because Deandre Jordan obviously made an all defensive team,
*  but he doesn't count because he's well passed in Sprung.
*  He made an all NBA team as well.
*  Did Deandre Jordan?
*  But I'm not counting him. Exactly.
*  And neither did Tom in the piece.
*  And Jokic has played with zero guys.
*  The average guy, I think, played with 14 of them to this point in his career.
*  Average guy played with 14.
*  Jokic is the only one that has played with none of those.
*  Magic played with the most at 32.
*  Bird was second at 29. Jokic zero.
*  So the point of like basically the article is he's had the least amount
*  of help of any MVP since 1984.
*  This is all 1984 on.
*  So we do the Ringer 100 voting where we vote for the 100 players,
*  which it's gimmicky, but it's fun to try to make a list
*  and see where guys rank. Right.
*  So Mitchell, I'm sorry, Murray, is somewhere in that group with.
*  You know, well, Anthony Edwards is probably past them,
*  but he's in there with Mitchell and Fox.
*  I had him the last time we voted, I think I had him 14th.
*  Because I value the playoff thing, right?
*  If you're going regular season, he's probably not top 15.
*  But if you're valuing how he can go up a level in the playoffs.
*  So let's say he's 15.
*  I had Aaron Gordon on this list.
*  Uh, somewhere, somewhere in the fifties.
*  And those are his two best teammates.
*  This is in the league.
*  And going back to like that Moses example where he's playing with Dr.
*  J, Mo Cheeks and Tony,
*  I do I do think he should get a little more credit for his ability
*  to lift everything up, which we saw during those no Murray seasons.
*  Yeah, he's just throwing a team on its back.
*  That would have been like a 20 win team otherwise.
*  I mean, what was Will Barton, his second leading score,
*  like the next score behind him, I think one of the years when he did that,
*  you know, a couple of other guys that are out of the league.
*  And with with Murray, like Murray hasn't even been fantastic in this postseason.
*  Let's be honest.
*  I mean, Murray was against the Lakers, had two good quarters,
*  maybe in in the entire series.
*  And then in this series, he's been, you know, he's been so so tonight.
*  He wasn't great.
*  He hit a couple of shots late to sort of make the stats look better.
*  But Murray hasn't been the same player he was last year by any stretch.
*  He had a nice little stretch in game four that I thought was huge.
*  And he was good in game three.
*  The heat pack was was kind of his signature boba the series.
*  And I know you guys talked about it, too, but Rosal and I talked about on Sunday night.
*  I just can't believe he wasn't suspended.
*  I just based on the history of punishment for that kind of stuff.
*  And if I'm a Minnesota fan now that I'm down three to I'm moving into full fledge.
*  We got absolutely screwed.
*  That guy should have been suspended.
*  If you go back and watch the clip, it's kind of crazy.
*  Like Townes could have easily stepped on that heat pack and gone flying
*  and like hyperextended his knee or something.
*  It's a clear one game suspension.
*  So at least Minnesota has that to grab on to without question.
*  And like any player out there, it's the same thing with Mitchell Robinson.
*  When NB pulled his leg like Mitchell Robinson should have went to the ground
*  and pretended like NB shot him.
*  Yeah, he should have rolled around for 10 minutes.
*  You're right.
*  Exactly. And somebody should have saw that he had and like slipped on it.
*  Now, granted, they probably didn't know that, you know, Jamal threw it.
*  They were probably just surprised by it.
*  And, you know, I think you talked about this, but it's got to go down
*  if they win as one of the biggest what ifs in NBA history.
*  Like he gets suspended.
*  Minnesota wins that series, maybe the championship, maybe it affects Boston.
*  Boston wins the championship or as they can't beat Denver.
*  So like Minnesota is not the only team that should be ticked
*  that Jamal Murray didn't get suspended.
*  Oklahoma City, Dallas, Boston, like anybody with a legitimate shot of the championship.
*  Or Jokic just would have put them on his back in game three and just just laid this back down.
*  Which would have made the legacy even grow even further.
*  We'll never know.
*  The other thing I missed as I look back on trying to figure out how much did I overreact
*  after game two? What would I do differently?
*  Edwards was so great in round one and the first two games around two that it really felt like,
*  you know, the word that MJ initials were getting thrown around.
*  We knew that wasn't the guy.
*  I don't like comparing him, but that's how that's how good he was.
*  And you see tonight, he looked like a 22 year old kid tonight.
*  He made a ton of mistakes.
*  He just wasn't that good.
*  Yeah. And 22 is why I'm not going to hammer the kid.
*  And I hope that's not what other people in the media do.
*  And I almost feel like exactly.
*  And I look what he did in game four.
*  I mean, game four, 44, five and five on I think it was like 15 to 26 from the field,
*  three of five from three.
*  Like he was amazing.
*  His teammates didn't lift them.
*  They really should have been up three, one if his teammates came along for the ride.
*  And I hope the rest of the media doesn't do that.
*  And I almost feel like the media is a whole kind of put him in that spot where people
*  have to criticize him because it's like, oh, he's Jordan, he's Jordan.
*  And then people get defensive.
*  Then they rip him.
*  See, I told you he's not Jordan.
*  He didn't do anything other than say, please don't compare me to Michael Jordan.
*  Exactly.
*  And people are going to hammer him tomorrow.
*  Probably.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, I told you he's not he's not Michael Jordan.
*  But listen, the way that he accepts criticism, I think is like first class.
*  The way that he handled like the loss the other day in game three, where he's like,
*  no, that's directly on me.
*  Reggie Miller was 100% right.
*  We got veterans that are 35, 36 that are pointing to their head coach in Phoenix
*  and in LA that don't take responsibility like Anthony Edwards took at the age of 22.
*  Yeah.
*  The only people who should be getting hammered tomorrow are Tyree Salberton and Riccardo,
*  which we'll get to in the next segment.
*  I'm still not sure Minnesota is out of this series.
*  They're coming home for game six.
*  And I don't know.
*  I, I, for some reason, I can't count them out yet because we have seen them dial up the defense.
*  So I'm not ready to say this is over, but I will say if Denver did flip this series
*  and they're going to end it in six, I was going back.
*  I was trying to figure out the great dig deep series flips we've had.
*  And it can't just be like a team that was down and came back like the 81 Celtics.
*  It's like, that's, that's a comeback.
*  That's not a dig.
*  We're digging deep.
*  Our backs aren't just against the wall.
*  They're through the wall.
*  And then we turned it.
*  And by the end of the series, we're just like fucking tattooing the other team.
*  The, the 2016 Cavs doesn't even totally qualify for this,
*  but I think they have to be mentioned just because game seven was so close.
*  But game five and game six, they really spanked the Warriors.
*  If you remember game four, right, right before Draymond punched LeBron the balls.
*  That was two, one in Cleveland game four.
*  And the Warriors played one of the best games of the entire career
*  and beat them in their house.
*  And the game was pretty much over when Draymond did the thing,
*  but it felt like the series is over.
*  And then the Cavs flipped it.
*  The oh six Mavs is a really good one where Dallas wins the first two.
*  And it's game three and then Wade makes that big comeback.
*  They get some calls and all of a sudden by game six, Dallas is a shell of themselves.
*  Right.
*  So that that's probably your worst case scenario.
*  The, the 95 Rockets fell behind to Phoenix to nothing.
*  And they, and got waxed in the first two games.
*  They were down three, one after the fourth game and then came back in those last three
*  and one and seven, the 93 Bulls lost the first two to the Knicks and came back.
*  And then I think my favorite one for this is the 77 Blazers where,
*  and where I'm going way back and people are like, what the who's on the seven.
*  That was the Bill Walton Blazers.
*  They poured them, wins the title.
*  They lose the first two games near the end of game two,
*  Darrell Dawkins gets in a fight with Maurice Lucas.
*  Somehow Doug Collins is the only one that gets punched.
*  Dawkins goes, destroys the toilet in the locker room after the game.
*  He's mad.
*  The Sixers didn't help him out.
*  And game three, that's it.
*  Portland just runs them off the court for the next couple of games.
*  They went in six.
*  It's pretty rare to see a team established dominance.
*  And then by the end of the series, they're getting their ass kicked.
*  And I don't know if that's going to happen in this series.
*  Do you think game six will be the culmination of that
*  or you expect Minnesota to fight back?
*  I think Minnesota is going to play hard.
*  Just cause I love the leadership of like Anthony Edwards.
*  I mean, Conley's a big, no, Conley tonight.
*  Yeah.
*  You should have mentioned that earlier.
*  Cause we talked, Bill, about all season Conley and how important it was to go
*  get like Monte Morris at the trade deadline, even though it's not a big name.
*  We're like, oh, that's important for Tim Conley to go out there and get
*  just cause they have no, their offense falls apart down the stretch.
*  If they don't have Mike Conley on the floor.
*  So like that was important.
*  So the loss of him is obviously important.
*  And here's the other thing.
*  I think that maybe we as a whole overreacted to with Minnesota
*  in saying that maybe they're the championship favorite at one point
*  after they were up to nothing is all season long, their offense wasn't any good
*  specifically down the stretch of games.
*  Like their clutch offense was bad.
*  We get on the Celtics case all the time, but their offense down the stretch isn't great.
*  I think they're returning down to, you know, they're returning down to the norm.
*  Maybe over the last couple of games where we didn't see it in the first six,
*  when they're going up against Phoenix, they're going up against Denver.
*  This is kind of the offense that we saw during the regular season out of them.
*  Yeah, I think that's fair.
*  Well, they lost by 15 tonight.
*  We'll see. They at least got towns going a little bit.
*  Conley, I'm sure we'll play in game six and they're going to have to figure out a way
*  to summon the game to energy again.
*  I don't know if they will.
*  Denver might have done it.
*  I don't know how they did it.
*  I really don't, but it's, it's, it's going to be a feather in the Yocach cap.
*  you
