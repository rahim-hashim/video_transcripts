# Too Soon to Completely Panic About the Grizzlies? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [November 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5yx_iOX0Jk)
*  Your team's 0 and 5.
*  We played a game with, uh, with house and Kyle Mann called too soon.
*  Dot, dot, dot.
*  Is it too soon to dot, dot, dot?
*  Is it too soon to completely panic about this grizzly season?
*  Completely panic?
*  Yes.
*  Uh, be worried?
*  No.
*  Um, I do think what we've learned though, Bill, like it's over the last couple
*  years, we do this every year.
*  Last year, Philly started one and four.
*  The Lakers started 0 and five Sacramento started 0 and four.
*  I mean, it happens.
*  We got to two weeks into November and the one seed I think was Utah.
*  And the two seed was Portland.
*  We got into two weeks into December and the one seed was the New Orleans Pelicans.
*  And so it's a, it's a really long season.
*  It's a really long season, but certainly to start off 0 and 5 and put yourself in
*  a hole is, is not a good look at all, especially when you know, you got to
*  somehow get to what, like you want to, you want to be at least in the mid
*  forties in terms of wind.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, 45 got the four seed last year.
*  That's what Phoenix said.
*  They were 45 and 37 and they got home court advantage.
*  So I don't know.
*  The problem is the conferences might be more lopsided this year because the
*  East just looks like it's weaker across the board and the West looks like
*  it's better across the board.
*  And it might be like, remember that wasn't that their year that Phoenix had like
*  48 wins and didn't make the playoffs.
*  I don't know if it'd be that bad, but I think mid forties is going to be the
*  number.
*  Yeah.
*  I think, I think, yeah, I think you're right.
*  That was like the Eric Bledsoe, Isaiah Thomas, that old crew where we thought
*  the guy did like, like the best coaching job ever back then.
*  But yeah, I don't know.
*  I mean, they've been terrible for sure.
*  And to lose to, you know, at Utah is not terrible at the Wizards is abominable.
*  I mean, you can't lose that game.
*  Right.
*  The scoring is rough.
*  House was talking earlier about, you know, your 29th in offense.
*  He just wasn't scared of any scores on the team.
*  Bane's good, but you don't have that.
*  Oh my God, we need a bucket.
*  This guy's definitely going to get us an awesome shot guy.
*  Bane's probably the closest.
*  The only thing that you can hold onto is they have run into historically
*  great shooting performances.
*  No one has ever given up more three pointers in the first five games of a
*  season than this Memphis Grizzlies.
*  89.
*  They've had two teams shoot 50% against them.
*  And now, you know, when teams shoot 45, 55 shots from three, if somebody goes
*  50% from you, you're dead.
*  You're dead.
*  Right.
*  So who's come in?
*  Who have you seen in person?
*  Who's coming to town?
*  I have seen Denver.
*  Unbelievable.
*  Yeah.
*  Dallas, but they were without Kyrie, which was shocking considering the
*  player participation thing is working so well.
*  That was like the third game of the season.
*  Third game of the season.
*  He wasn't on the injury report.
*  I show up to the arena and they say there's no Kyrie.
*  I said, why?
*  So he sprained his foot.
*  I guess he, he must've, he must've sprained at mid afternoon.
*  Um, I have seen them.
*  I've seen the Pelicans the first time.
*  What'd you think of them?
*  Wait, what was your Pelicans take?
*  You know, it was, uh, I got, uh, look, I've gotten in big trouble and the
*  Pelicans, like their team account is now mocking me because I just thought it was
*  odd, like I thought they had a weird chemistry with that starting five, like,
*  you know, they're hardly interacting with each other.
*  I don't know about the Ingram Zion thing, but I guess lucky for them,
*  they never play together.
*  Um, they're already not playing together by now, but they, um, I think, you
*  know, I think it's hard.
*  I actually think that they're going to have to do some figuring out to reach
*  where they want to be in terms of the pecking order and also just kind of
*  getting some role guys, you know, they've got Nance, they've got Alvarado.
*  They got Trey Murphy.
*  These guys are all like good role players.
*  A couple of those guys are obviously not in the mix right now.
*  Dyson Daniels can be a role player, but you know, when they're starting, they're
*  starting for non-defenders and Herb Jones.
*  Right.
*  That's that, you know, and so I don't know who odd man out is in those mixes,
*  but you know, when it comes to reaching their potential, I think.
*  You know, you're going to need, you're going to need some guys in there
*  that can get you some stops.
*  They also don't shoot a lot of threes.
*  And I think it's hard now, you know, Phoenix does this as well.
*  Um, if you don't shoot a lot of threes, it, the math just doesn't go
*  in your favor a lot of times.
*  They don't, they don't have a lot of guys.
*  And obviously Murphy is probably the best of the three point shooters.
*  Uh, they're trying to get this Hawkins kid going that they drafted.
*  Um, yeah, but, uh, yeah, I mean, I think.
*  Their whole thing is how much health can they have to, and Ingram's already out.
*  We're like, we're in week two of the season.
*  That's what that's been their issue thus far anyway.
*  And so look, it's not, it's, it's not a demerit to watch them and say, Hey,
*  these guys don't seem to have all that much chemistry considering they never
*  played together, none of them.
*  And now already by the second week of the season, they're not playing together.
*  And so I saw, yeah, I think I've seen, uh, yeah, oh, and three.
*  Uh, so I've, I've seen, I've seen Pelicans, Denver, Dallas.
*  I watched the OKC New Orleans last night and it looked like OKC was just
*  going to win by 20, they were way up.
*  And then New Orleans has these weird heat check guys.
*  Like yesterday was McCollum, but all of a sudden they'll get like points in bursts.
*  I'm still trying to figure them out.
*  To me, that's like a don't gamble on them or against them team.
*  If you're just like betting basketball, stay away from that dude.
*  I watched them as well and O'Gilman city is too small.
*  Right.
*  They need one more guy.
*  I mean, they're running ched out there to play center and you know, you're going
*  up against Valance Eunice and Zion.
*  And I mean, they got full grown men on that Pelicans team.
*  The only thing is there's only a couple of teams like that, that you could say
*  like, Oh man, this is a big boy team.
*  You guys are in trouble tonight.
*  So there there's certain nights like Yokech is going to be a
*  disaster for them every time they play.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, the Grizzlies ran into it last year in the playoffs without Adams.
*  The Lakers are big.
*  Lakers are big, you know, so Minnesota's big.
*  Minnesota is big and a little clumsy and really hard to play, which
*  Denver found out last night.
*  Um, so where is the city at with, uh, with the Jaws saga?
*  They give us the update.
*  How are people feeling?
*  Is it, do people feel like it's now us against the world?
*  Um, I think it was Jaws corner.
*  Are people worried about him?
*  What's the mindset?
*  I think it was upset with him for sure.
*  Very disappointed.
*  Then I think the best thing that ever happened to him was the ESPN article.
*  Because I think what happened is it's like everybody's mad at you.
*  You know what it reminded me of?
*  It reminded me of Will Smith, how we all loved Will Smith and then Will Smith went
*  and smacked the shit out of Chris Rock.
*  And we were like, damn man, what's up with Will Smith?
*  Like I always thought he was cool.
*  I always really love Will Smith.
*  I'm so disappointed.
*  And then Jada Pinkett went on her tour and started trashing Will Smith.
*  They were like, oh hell no, no, no, no, no.
*  No, like we're allowed to not like it, but like, this is, this is overkill.
*  This is too much.
*  Like you don't have to humiliate the guy.
*  And that's kind of where the ESPN are in the absence of a bunch of new stuff.
*  Um, it was almost like, all right.
*  It feels like-
*  You're going with the small business owners?
*  Come on.
*  Like, yeah, like it feels like piling on.
*  Um, and so I think that on that point, it was like, okay, you kind of got people
*  back, uh, on your side.
*  And then now that the team's not any good, obviously there's a bit of resent
*  about that, like, man, why'd you have to do the Instagram live thing?
*  It's so stupid.
*  Um, but I also think that we have, when I go out and around, all anybody says is,
*  do you think we can, you know, you think you could be 10 and 15 or do you think
*  you can be, you know, nine and 16 or whatever by the time we get him back.
*  And it's just now, just like, all right, these next 20 games, we'll see what
*  happens, but can't wait to go 26.
*  Even if you go 10 and 10, you're going to be 10 to 15 when it comes back,
*  which is not ideal.
*  So I don't know.
*  Um, the story sucks.
*  I actually miss watching them play.
*  It just sucks to get guys pulled out of this daily, you know, cavalcade,
*  awesome NBA players we get to watch every night.
*  And it really might be too late by the time he comes back.
*  Cause if we think it's 45 and they're nine and 16, and he has 57 games left
*  and you have to get to 45 wins, which means you need 30.
*  So you gotta go basically 36 and 19.
*  The moment he comes back.
*  And yeah, I would assume he has to get into some sort of game shape, stuff like that.
*  All the West, you're not going to have the easy games like you would in the past.
*  Cause there's going to be 11 teams that think they have a chance.
*  I think it's going to be really hard.
*  Like you need something to step up.
*  This will make you mad.
*  But we were talking about Julius Randall with, uh, house and Kyle.
*  And, uh, we talked about, could the Grizzlies roll the dice
*  with the Julius Randall trade?
*  Oh, come on.
*  No good grief.
*  Look, they're going to go, they're going to go get themselves a good wing.
*  Okay.
*  They're going to do, they're going to go get themselves a good wing.
*  And like a Jeremy Grant, how good of a way are you talking?
*  No, I don't know.
*  I just think that this is my prediction.
*  What's going to happen is they were going to let all the young guys figure it out.
*  And they were going to see who could separate themselves.
*  So you're going to throw them all in a bucket.
*  Zaire Williams, David Roddy, Luke Knorr, Jake Larravia.
*  They're going to throw them all in a bucket.
*  They're going to say, all right, who comes out of this?
*  Now in the end, when Ja comes back, Smart will probably just roll over to small forward.
*  Um, in the meantime, uh, to be a wing defender.
*  But I do think that they could look at a wing to try to get one of the, uh, to try to get,
*  you know, maybe you revisit the Ananobe type stuff or you revisit, you know, there are
*  guys out there that become available.
*  And so I think that's one.
*  Maybe you go, maybe go the other way.
*  Well, there you go.
*  You know what?
*  This was the year from how we lost Brandon Clark.
*  You lost Steven Adams.
*  You lost Ja for 25.
*  No, not when you've got, not when you've got Ja Morant, Desmond Bayne, and Jared Jackson
*  Jr.
*  Not, come on, come on.
*  You're ruling it out.
*  Yeah.
*  What if they're, what if they're six and 19 when he comes back?
*  I mean, they're not going to be six and 19 when he comes back.
*  You would have said they wouldn't have been on five.
*  I would have said they wouldn't have been on five, but I mean, playing five games in
*  the first seven days of the season is pretty extreme.
*  It's not that good of a basketball team.
*  I mean, you don't, you don't want them to be good.
*  You want Marcus to suffer.
*  And that's not true.
*  I like Marcus.
*  That's not true.
*  No, all you Boston fans say the same thing.
*  No, that's not true.
*  You guys all, you all, yes you are.
*  It's like your ex and you're checking on Instagram to make sure that she's doing
*  shitty.
*  Not true.
*  Yes it is.
*  It's a hundred percent what's happening.
*  We're not, no, we love Marcus.
*  We're super happy with our team.
*  Yeah, he's been pretty good.
*  Actually looks like he's in, I was worried about the abdomen thing, but it actually
*  looks like he's in good shape and he's moving around.
*  This is my dream.
*  My dream is that you look up in April and it's a nightmare for you.
*  It's John Moran, Desmond Bain, Marcus Smart, Jaren Jackson and big Rob Williams.
*  And you've got to sit there.
*  Yeah, you want Rob Williams.
*  And you always got, I mean, come on, what's going on?
*  What is he doing in Portland?
*  He's collecting dust.
*  Does that make any sense?
*  They should be needed for.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's got like a $12 million contract or something.
*  So that's not even a big, like not that big.
*  And it's not that big of a deal to have to deal for.
*  Well, you can't, you can't score.
*  You can't really rebound.
*  And you just listed five guys in a row that you were counting on for one of those guys
*  to step up.
*  And it was basically the poo poo platter.
*  You were like, yeah, if we can get the spare ribs or the chicken wings or the egg rolls,
*  if one of those can be good.
*  I like Roddy.
*  I like Roddy.
*  I do like Roddy.
*  The other ones, I mean, we'll see.
*  But, you know, it's five games.
*  It's five games.
*  I mean, you just, you just outlined like you were like, well, what if they, then they
*  got to go this many, then they got to go this many.
*  This is why you're on the NBA Too Soon podcast.
*  It's, all of this is too soon.
*  What else are we going to talk about?
