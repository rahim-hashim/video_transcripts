# Week 1 NBA Takeaways With Kirk Goldsberry  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [October 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv2GK05yNzw)
*  Kurt Goldsberry is here. You need some sort of gimmick for us. Like the professor. What do you want to be?
*  I'm a professor. Yeah, I like that. Let's do that. I am technically a professor here at the University of Texas.
*  So maybe that's not even a gimmick, but I like it.
*  Well, I like it for the pod. Like the professor is here.
*  We want to talk NBA. We've had a week not counting tonight's games.
*  You know, everybody does like overreactions and to me it's more of trying to stay calm
*  and noticing things that have jumped out of the TV to me one way or the other.
*  So we're going to get into a whole bunch of that. But I just asked you come up with five things. It could be any list you want.
*  You wanted to do five
*  important developments
*  even though we're only one week in. But the thing is what is the season like 25 weeks?
*  Yeah, I was trying to think.
*  Yeah, I was trying to think about that in NFL terms. They have 17 weeks now.
*  I feel like we have to have like 30 weeks or something. Yeah, whatever it is.
*  I mean the thing about overreactions, you can see some things
*  that go
*  ooh
*  like Denver's bench is like
*  anyway, five important developments start us off. What do you want to hit first?
*  Well, you just started us off. I have the Denver Nuggets, Bill Simmons. The Denver Nuggets might be in big trouble.
*  That's my first development and I think it has a lot to do with something I wouldn't have predicted with any Nikola Jokic team
*  just a few years ago and that's their shooting numbers. They ranked 28th
*  in effective field goal percentage. You mentioned they're very thin.
*  I think they're particularly thin when it comes to one emerging skill in pro basketball, which is shooting three-point shots.
*  They let KCP go famously.
*  This is after letting Jeff Green and Bruce Brown get away previous to that. Then of course they imported
*  Russell Westbrook to a team that already ranked last in three-point attempts
*  last season. So here we are with Westbrook on that team and the numbers maybe shouldn't have surprised us.
*  But the Russell Westbrook thing especially has been a debacle in the 58 minutes he's played. They have a net rating of negative 30
*  and in 91 minutes he hasn't played they're plus 11, which is a lot more Nuggets like. So that's my first one.
*  I mean this is a team that a lot of us thought could compete for the championship
*  and certainly early it doesn't look like they have the offense to do that.
*  Yeah, it's a respect for
*  the stuff they've done the last few years. Respect for the fact that they have one of the three or four best players in the league
*  depending where you want to put them. You could put them first.
*  When we did the over under odds
*  I ended up going over. Did not feel great about it. It was really just a respect for Yoke-age thing.
*  But you know when the over under was I think it was 51 and a half something like that
*  as we were like a month away from the season. It seemed really high with all the things that were in flux. What's interesting though
*  every single thing that was in flux
*  or I'm a little worried about this or what if that doesn't.
*  It feels like they're nine for nine with it going the wrong way against them, right?
*  Murray looks
*  okay. He doesn't look like the Murray from you know two years ago. Porter does not look the same.
*  Gordon the shooting thing becomes even more drastic when nobody can shoot. All the guys they were counting on off on the
*  bench of the world players.
*  I don't really think any of their shots are going to go in. Like Brown had that big shot in the
*  overtime game last night in the corner wide open. I didn't think it was going in.
*  And then you see Yoke-age having to take this huge offensive burden now where he's 40 both nights.
*  That's not who he wants to be.
*  No.
*  No, it's almost like those LeBron teams in Cleveland where he had nothing the first time he was in Cleveland.
*  He can do that, but he's not put on this earth to do that. He's put on his earth to make everybody else around him better.
*  And they're really sort of Peter principleing Christian Brown. He's he's being promoted to this level of
*  expectation that it is not suited for him. And again, it goes back to this front office.
*  Not being able to build a
*  really deep bench around somebody I would say is the best player in the world right now, particularly on offense.
*  So I think this is a failure for
*  a front office to build, particularly spacing
*  around this offensive savant. A guy that almost beat Team USA single-handedly in the Olympics this summer, Bill.
*  And then we show up. Yeah, Jamal Murray's not who he used to be. Michael Porter Jr's off to a slow start.
*  Aaron Gordon's never been a floor spacer.
*  So what do you do around that? You got to find shooting.
*  And they just haven't done it. And in fact, they did the opposite by importing probably the most
*  infamous jump shooter of our time in Russell Westbrook.
*  And it's been woeful and it's been really harsh to see. And so I just don't think they're a contender
*  with this group we've seen in week one.
*  It really bums me out. And they've taken some swings because on the one hand you could call them a little cheap for having
*  I think he's the best player in the world.
*  I would also understand if somebody else wanted to really make a strong Luca case, whatever. But I still think Jokic has the belt.
*  But you know, they gave Zeke Nagy,
*  gave him this four year deal, right? That he's making nine million a year. You look even like how do they fix this?
*  It's really hard to make trades with them.
*  You know, because I thought like the trade that made the most sense in my head right away was something with Michael Porter
*  and Zach Levine.
*  I was like, Zach Levine's kind of, this is a different look for them.
*  Makes them a little smaller, but he brings some stuff that they need. He can create his own shot.
*  Not everything has to go through Jokic. He's a good three point shooter. He's not good defensively,
*  but that's fine because maybe your offense will get so much better. It's not going to matter.
*  But you can't even do trade. That's not a straight up trade that works. You have to put Zeke Nagy in it.
*  You have to use like the Bulls trade exception. And then the question is well, why would the Bulls want Michael Porter and Zeke Nagy?
*  So
*  I don't even really know how they make the team better. They don't have anybody in that mid-range level like that
*  12 to 20 million
*  type of player that you could flip and the Bucks are in a similar position too, but
*  I don't know what the move is to fix this. I think is a bigger issue for me.
*  I don't see one and I don't think there there is one coming and and I think one of the only moves is to
*  to make Jokic do all of the stuff that he doesn't like to do specifically to three point shooting and if you look at
*  their three point shooting without Jokic the numbers get even bleaker.
*  So I know that you've been talking a little bit about Jokic losing his three point shot in the summer. It looks like it's back.
*  It's unfair for this dude to also be the team's best floor spacer. That can't be the answer. We can't have
*  the guy
*  being the best rebounder,
*  the best playmaker and your best three point shooter.
*  He is the MVP three of the last four years, but even that's too much to ask for Nicole Jokic at this point.
*  Well, the other thing with that
*  it looks good now because it's we're four games into this season,
*  but you saw it last year like his legs started to go during the playoffs and he he just
*  the three point shot wasn't the same. He defenses are clearly like we want you to shoot this now,
*  right? It's a go ahead and knock yourself out. If you go four for ten from there fine, whatever because
*  we're also covering all this other stuff.
*  But the fact that Porter hasn't gotten better
*  and I really wonder like did the stuff that happened with his brother like how much did that affect him?
*  How much off-court baggage is in there with how he just doesn't look the same?
*  He's had a bunch of injuries over the years, but
*  to me he just doesn't look like dynamic. Like I would take I really like watching the Hawks
*  even though they're not that good.
*  You could talk me into like four Hawks wings over Michael Porter Jr. at this point.
*  So the fact that he's just not even an impact player in any way,
*  combined with all this other stuff. It's I know everybody's been talking about the Nuggets,
*  but this is really important. This is one of this is probably the best player of his generation.
*  I also feel like they might have cheated out. They won the title 17 months ago. We're going to talk about them.
*  They have the best player in the world according to many of us.
*  And then one of the weirdest things I've seen is early this season is is a head coach,
*  you know pining for a player that left the team.
*  Cantavious Caldwell-Pope who would solve some of these problems, but he's
*  repeatedly mentioned this and there's some tension reportedly between
*  the coaching staff and the front office.
*  By the way, that's not reported. I think
*  there's definitely tension because those rumors were flying around and then right as the season starts
*  he comes out and is like, you know who'd really be nice? Cantavious Caldwell-Pope.
*  Like you don't do that shit unless there's some deep rooted stuff going on.
*  Yeah, I agree. And I'd never seen I don't know somebody correct me if I'm wrong.
*  I haven't seen a coach be like man, we really could use that guy back. Like that just that's just you know, nobody does that.
*  So I I think there's
*  I think there's a revelation there that they just don't have enough pieces particularly on that perimeter.
*  And then Michael Porter jr is being asked to be more than he is because Cantavious isn't there anymore.
*  So it's just it's just all a symptom. I I think of of poor team building there.
*  Yeah, Michael Porter is basically
*  13 and 7.
*  He's not going to create shots for anybody else. This three-point shot is going to have a little variance to it.
*  Murray's at 17 a game through the three games. He did get the game time basket that sent the game to overtime.
*  Last night where he looked like old school Murray a little bit, but
*  I wonder like do you feel
*  when somebody's doing the same thing over and over and over and over again for years.
*  I'm not saying the play is stoppable now, but we've had just had so many reps with it that the defenses at least have
*  somewhat of a sense of what to do. And then when they're shooting around Murray and Jokic together isn't awesome.
*  It just feels like not as unstoppable as it did two years ago to me.
*  Dude when that ball is falling find in Russell Westbrook after those passing sequences, it's just not as scary. Yeah, there's
*  There's
*  there's another defender that doesn't really have to you know,
*  pay attention to the corner or to the wing than normally had to. So yeah,
*  it's a lot easier to defend when there's not contavious out there and I know I'm beating a dead horse,
*  but that's the thing. It's not just the possessions where they end up draining the three. It's the one where they thin you out
*  and it's a backdoor cut for Aaron Gordon and suddenly that plays easier to defend. So yeah,
*  I think there's these ecological impacts,
*  but the bottom line is you're not going to win the NBA title Bill Simmons in
*  2025 if you're the worst three-point shooting team in the NBA. You're not going to do it.
*  And I'm not saying that's where they're going. Especially when OKC and Boston are in the league.
*  100% and
*  yeah, I just think
*  it's a tale of two cities in terms of building a deep roster over the last two NBA championship teams.
*  Boston has done it right at the Brad Stevens. Denver has not.
*  The other thing I wonder,
*  so you're talking about the Cronkies who own multiple sports franchises,
*  franchises,
*  who won a team,
*  won a title a couple years ago, right?
*  So it's not like they're like, oh man, we're going to do whatever it takes for the Nuggets to win the title. They won the title.
*  They also have a best player
*  who is not going to be exactly leaking stuff to reporters and
*  doing passive aggressive shit or being like, I don't know, maybe
*  I don't know how long I'm going to be here if we're not committed to winning.
*  They're spending money, but they're not really spending money. And the people I've talked to in the league,
*  everyone's kind of shocked that they weren't more all in
*  on this Yocage Murray window.
*  And Caldwell Pope, there's been
*  reports about, oh, he took,
*  he basically could have had either offer. He chose the Orlando offer. But that's also one they maybe could have locked up
*  a year ago or
*  done a better job. But they clearly thought, no, no, our young guys can step up into that spot.
*  He only averaged eight points a game in the playoffs last year.
*  It just feels like they're not lavishly spending the way like the Celtics are spending right now.
*  Maybe that's not the perfect path either. Celtics are going to be a hundred million, you know,
*  over the luxury tax, whatever the hell it is. But at least as a Celtics fan, I'm like, my owners give a shit.
*  They're spending, they want to win the title again. I don't think Denver fans can say that.
*  It certainly doesn't. And that KCP transaction or lack thereof, I think is a very good sort of proving point for that. And yeah, they just don't have
*  the Aaron Gordon, yes, great transaction a few years ago. Jamal Murray is slipping. Michael Porter Jr.
*  isn't as good as I thought he'd be at this point in his career.
*  And below that line of four guys that we can all picture,
*  that's the exact part that the Celtics have gotten right. The Spurs used to get right.
*  The 4-12.
*  Yeah, because you have to have those guys. And a lot of times, Bill, those guys are your shooters. Those are your spacers. You mentioned the bench early.
*  That's just the exact part where they're letting Jokic and the fans down is they're just not doing 4-12 right.
*  I still love watching Jokic. I watched a lot of the game last night.
*  This is a fascinating version of him because if you look at the scoring title right now, and that was one of the things I wrote down, I was just like, hmm.
*  The scoring title has Jokic and Davis near the top after a week. I don't think that's going to last. I think Luca is going to end up winning it.
*  But Cam Thomas shoots 28 times a game. To me, the scoring title could go nine directions.
*  I do wonder, will this be a career high for Jokic from a scoring standpoint? Will he get to 29 a game? Because I think he's going to have to.
*  If he didn't score 41 the other night against the Clippers, they were going to be in bigger trouble than they already were.
*  And he had to score 40 for them to win an OT in Toronto, which isn't exactly a juggernaut right now. He has to do this.
*  There's just no other options. And again, I think the analogy is LeBron in the pre-Miami era where he had to do a lot of the work as a scorer himself.
*  So you're talking about Mo Williams, Antoine Jamison, Washed Up Shack.
*  Yeah, that era.
*  Was Drew Gooden? I can't remember if it was something.
*  Definitely Drew Gooden. Yeah. So I think that's not a good comp. Anytime we're talking about that roster for that player who is a very gifted player at that time in the 2000s, that's not a good comp for Calvin Booth and the Denver Nuggets front office.
*  Well, here's my question. And the Bucks might be coming up as one of your other developments.
*  Are you more worried about the Bucks or the Nuggets? Because I'm more worried about the Nuggets than the Bucks.
*  Because with the Bucks, you can at least talk yourself into a, well, when Chris Middleton comes back, they'll at least be able to defend wings.
*  Maybe not that great, but way better than how they're doing it.
*  Right now, the Bucks problem is any guard who can get into the paint and any wing who can get in the paint can do whatever the fuck they want against the Bucks.
*  It's like an all you can eat buffet. What do you want to do? Do you want to shoot a floater? Do you want to get to the rim? Do you want to do a stop and then a step back three?
*  Everything's that you want to post somebody up, come play the Bucks. And I don't know how they fix it. They're atrocious defensively. Middleton will make it a little better. I don't know what the fix is for the Nuggets.
*  Yeah, well, I think one of those two stars is more likely to ask out than the other one. So I'm going to say I'm more worried about the Milwaukee Bucks.
*  And that is my next developing friend. So I don't know if you want to do that now.
*  Let's do it now.
*  Yeah.
*  Because it is a very similar situation, but on the opposite end of the court. I mean, just like we sort of started to associate Nicole Jokic with just offensive efficiency in a can.
*  If you have them on the court, your top 10 offense. That's somehow not happening in Denver this year. The opposite was true, I thought, with Yannis and Brooke in Milwaukee, especially in the Bud era.
*  But their defenses is garbage right now, Bill. And I think they have a good chance of starting two and five or one and six.
*  And they are losing to teams, including the Chicago Bulls. They couldn't stop Kobe White or Zach Levine in that game.
*  They lost to the Brooklyn Nets, which was one of the more eye popping results of this young season.
*  But but also not eye popping because I was like, I forget what the line was, but it was high for the Bucks.
*  And I'm like, man, I bet the Nets could like give the Bucks a game.
*  I just feel like anybody who has wing scores and point guards that can create are a problem for the Bucks.
*  They should never be favored by 11 over anybody.
*  Well, then Peyton Pritchard comes out and looks like Klay Thompson against them from 2015.
*  So you're exactly right. You nailed it. They can't stop perimeter offense, which is not Mike Budenholzer's era.
*  Bucks team and certainly not Drew Holliday's era Bucks defense.
*  Last year, I think, well, in Bud's last year, Milwaukee ranked number one.
*  This is an ancient history. They ranked number one in defense two years ago.
*  They ranked 19 last year. That was a lost season.
*  But early this year, they're 26. And it's the nature of it.
*  It's the open threes that are giving up. It's the drive and finish from the perimeter players.
*  It's Damian Lillard not doing his job and nobody covering up in rotations.
*  The lack of Chris Middleton is being felt to some extent.
*  But this is an Eastern Conference that's less forgiving than it has been.
*  And I'm pretty worried about the Milwaukee Bucks because I've also heard some men tell that the
*  vibes aren't great there either with some of their top tier talent.
*  And, you know, I don't know if it's Giannis or Damian or Chris or whatever.
*  The bottom line is they might start one and six and their defense might be bottom 10.
*  And that's not a recipe for long term success.
*  And the big picture question.
*  Did they just get passed by a couple of teams?
*  Like I watched that Orlando-Indiana game last night, which I want to talk about at some point
*  as we're talking here. And those teams are just really young and really athletic and have multiple
*  options and really fun lineups they can put together.
*  And they're built around guys who can create shots.
*  And if Paolo is going to keep doing what he's doing, I just like Orlando sealing more than
*  Milwaukee as a regular season team, much less a playoff team.
*  I, we talked about it before the season when we did the over under pod and I brought up
*  Yana straight stuff a couple of times and I think people thought I was being a dick about it.
*  This is stuff that's been going around for a year and they can deny it.
*  He can deny it, but it comes down to the basic premise of the guy wants to compete for titles.
*  And if he doesn't feel like everything around him is title worthy at some point,
*  he's going to go to a place that he wants to compete, that he'll be able to compete for titles.
*  I look at this Bucks team and I, and it's really hinging on Middleton who hasn't been a hundred
*  percent healthy in three years, right? And he's 33 years old. They have an old team in general.
*  And now you're putting all this pressure on the Middleton piece, which it can't be ruled out.
*  But I wouldn't bet on it.
*  And I love what you said with Sal the other day about our, our LeBron and Tom Brady sort
*  of deforming our ideas of aging curves, you know, like they, they, they, there are these two examples
*  of just once in a generation competitors that also just broke aging curves. And, and Chris
*  Middleton is a great example. This is a normal 33, 34 year old season. Like there's going to be this
*  Brooke Lopez is getting up there like under normal circumstances, we would, we would be ready for
*  this. And I think age is a big factor. By the way, Damian Lillard, not exactly a young player
*  anymore. I think this is an old basketball team and you've studied this for years. They don't
*  do well, especially aging guards like Damian Lillard. This is not unusual to see this exact
*  thing happen. And I hate trade demand stuff. I hate trade demand gossip, but that Intel is out
*  there folks. The, the Yana stuff is out there. Leave it to other people to talk about the, the
*  deals and stuff like that. But you're exactly right. I think there's a world where, where this,
*  he's the next big domino to drop in that kind of trade demand. You know, media place.
*  The Knicks were waiting on it last year and then he ended up doubling down. They, they did the
*  Dame trade and I think they had to audible to other stuff they had planned. I asked them,
*  would enroll the Knicks out long-term with the honest to begin with, like they have the towns
*  piece that would work as the contract. I don't, I went through all the teams again. I was on a
*  text ride with some friends talking about it today and I don't really know what the team is.
*  If you're talking about titles, which we talked about when we did the over under pod last month,
*  there's not like the perfect fit, but I know that dude doesn't want to be irrelevant and just like
*  little like him not being on the Christmas day game. It's not nothing, right? You're not on one
*  of the 10 most interesting teams in the league anymore. Also, you don't really have a chance.
*  Doesn't seem like to win a title unless there's some, some roster changes, but the Dame,
*  the one thing with this is the Dame thing I feel like was pretty predictable because he had stopped
*  playing defense for a few years and then the Middleton, just him getting hurt three years in
*  a row, like he hasn't been healthy since that 2021 playoffs. So, and they missed on some draft picks,
*  which is the other piece of this. The Celtics did a good job with a couple of their fringe
*  guys that they found. How's her cornet Pritchard, like guys that even the Tillman trade last year,
*  guys they can plug in who can eat some innings for them. And the bucks haven't found that.
*  But it's so funny to bring that up because I remember in 2022, May of 2022, not, not ancient
*  history sitting at TD before that Grant Williams game, right? And you think back to that. I remember
*  talking to people around me and being like, I feels like we're going to watch these two teams play
*  big playoff games for the entire decade, doesn't it? And it just felt like that, like that was just
*  a rivalry we were going to get start this thing. And, and what did Brad Stevens do in the last few
*  years? He turned Grant Williams and Time Lord and Smart and Brogdon into this new deeper than ever
*  basketball team that won the championship. And Milwaukee's kind of gone the other way in that
*  same time period. And I just, it just doesn't feel right in their old. And the other thing about the
*  Damien deal, much like the Beale deal is that paralyzes your ability to, to trim around the
*  edges, to, to build small pieces around there. That that's a big number. And in this new CB era
*  bill, nobody wants to talk about the nerdy stuff. Just know that it's really hard to build a team
*  when you have one of these $60 million players on your cap. Right. And the Celtics got off
*  two guys when their value was probably higher than who they were as players, right? Grant,
*  and most importantly, Marcus Smart, who I think had a lot of miles on them, they sniffed it out.
*  Everyone went nuts when they traded them. I was probably on the side of people defending it.
*  Cause I was just like, I just think he's hitting maybe a different point in his career.
*  And he gets hurt last year, which is fluky, but this year you watch them and it's, it's,
*  it's not the Marcus Smart from three, four years ago. This is the shit that happens. So one of the
*  bucks mistake was they moved on. It feels like the wrong guy, right? They use Drew. They basically
*  drew became the fall guy for the two disappointing playoff performances. And then they kept the rest
*  of the nucleus and maybe they would have been better off. I don't know, come up with a different
*  plan. It's hard to rule out Janis. He still want to just like, it's hard to rule out Jokic, but.
*  Oh dude. Yeah. I think they, yeah. So they lost the one eight series and Miami just destroyed,
*  drew holiday. I mean, Jimmy Butler did, did do a lot of damage to drew holiday in that series. And
*  Milwaukee overreacted. I mean, I'm a spur guy. You know that spurs lost an eight one series
*  at some point during their run to Memphis. Yeah. It was in 2011. Did they fire pop? Did they trade
*  Tony? No, they didn't do that stuff. They said, God, that sucks. Like we, we, we got our asses
*  kicked. Let's get better and come back next year. They didn't overreact. And I think they know what
*  they did is that they did the George Hill trade that year for overreaction was they traded
*  their fifth best player, not their second best player. But yeah, I don't think that's going to
*  age well that that period, because Janis was hurt in that series too. And it's like, okay guys,
*  that's you're not going to win the championship every year. Like even the spurs dynasty, they
*  won five out of like 16 chances. Like you're not going to do it. You're not going to do it.
*  The other thing I think they've missed, I was talking to somebody about this the other day
*  that I just said, as I've said a million times, I think the league is better.
*  And these teams that you would put together, that would look like a 2018 contender.
*  I don't think that's conceivable anymore. Even look at like the Lakers have looked pretty good
*  for the first four games. That's not just about LeBron and AD, like Reeves is playing really well.
*  Rui is playing really well, right? The coach is a huge upgrade from last year's coach. It seems like
*  so far some of their role guys have been okay, but it's not just the two guys. And that that's,
*  that was what made the Celtics so special last year. That's what made the Mavs have realized
*  we got to go nine deep. You got to use the regular season a certain way.
*  And then you see the bucks and it's like so much pressure is on
*  Giannis and Dame having like a 35 point game. And then what's plan B if those things don't happen?
*  I don't know. I still like their ceiling with the Middleton piece, but you could also tell me he's
*  never going to be the guy again. And I would believe that too. The Nuggets, I have a much
*  harder time. The Nuggets basically come down to can Murray get back to where he was? And if you're
*  going to tell me he's going to get back to where he was, I'm feeling better even with the lack of
*  shooting. He saved their asses in that Toronto game in his home area. That was a good sign.
*  He is one of the, yeah, he has a gear and he has that clutch gene that so many guys don't have,
*  but he hasn't looked good in a while, particularly in the Fever play.
*  For what we're, you know, I had him probably like 22nd in the Ringer 100 this summer, you know, and
*  I don't know if I'd put him in top 25. What's your third big development?
*  Well, you're just talking about it. And our friend JJ Reddick looks like a good NBA coach. And you
*  were talking about it. I think the Lakers look like a different group. And it's really interesting.
*  I think JJ has found something. And if you followed it closely and talked to him in the summer,
*  he was obsessed with how can I get more out of Anthony Davis, Bill? And early on, one of the
*  developing things right now is that he's found a way. And Anthony looks as good as he's ever looked
*  as a Laker, maybe outside of the bubble so far. And I think, you know, playing through Anthony on
*  offense, giving him more responsibility, his work so far. But it's more than that. I think JJ has
*  also done a great job of getting the role players to feel invested, to feel like they're part of the
*  group. And I think he's designing ATOs that end with, you know, Austin Reeves or Rui getting a
*  good look. He knows the tricks. I know he's been a role player. And I think that you couldn't ask
*  for a better first week. I know they're three and one and not four and oh, but this is a great start
*  for JJ Reddick. And not everybody was predicting that, by the way. You didn't have to look very
*  far in our world to find somebody who's like, oh, JJ doesn't know what he's doing. This is going to
*  be a disaster. Well, through one week, at least, it's not a disaster in Los Angeles. Yeah. If you
*  had to tell me bet on disaster or great coach, I probably would have bet on disaster just because
*  I just think it's really hard to be a coach. And there's a whole bunch of stuff that goes with it,
*  including how you deal with your best players, how you deal with the media day in day out.
*  I've been super impressed and I haven't gone to a game yet. So I haven't seen it in person, but
*  they look really crisp. I like the plays that he designs coming out of timeouts. Like there's
*  just little subtle shit where you can tell, oh, this team knows what to do. And last night,
*  he gets the Suns. LeBron had a bad game. He didn't have it last night. And I think in the past,
*  they wouldn't have kind of moved the car keys away from him. And JJ has already shown to me,
*  he's not afraid to be like, hey, LeBron, you don't really have it tonight. Let's toss the car keys
*  over there. Because I felt like their last couple of years, I felt like there were games where like
*  Reeves, as crazy as this sounds, was probably a better creator matchup for them. Right. He just
*  had a worse part guarding him. He could run pick and roll with Davis better. And maybe we don't
*  need LeBron as much this game, but LeBron, because he's LeBron, I think the previous coaches were
*  kind of paralyzed by it. JJ is clearly like, we're going with the matchups that are going to win this
*  game. LeBron was like to the side last night. It was really interesting to watch. And what he's
*  done for Davis is like undeniable. Now Davis could get hurt tomorrow. But that's the thing.
*  But he's, he's as invested and as competitive as I've seen. And the last thing, because I'm doing a
*  rambling monologue, I really like how intense he is on the sidelines in a good way. And I have
*  a lot of different thoughts about what coach behavior should be on a sideline, because I think
*  these guys are all adults. They don't need Rick Pitino yelling and slamming the clipboard and
*  they don't need somebody yapping the whole time. He's more intense than like a locked in way. Like
*  if they get fucked on a call, he's going right at the refs. He's, you could see him pacing on the
*  sidelines. When it gets to the last two minutes, it's almost like he's playing. And I think they
*  kind of needed that. Don't you feel like they, they kind of needed that energy. And I think they've,
*  they've been in every one of these games, even the Suns game, they almost won.
*  Yeah. The Suns game on the road against the team that also looks like they have a good new coach
*  and is playing better than they had been. But yeah, I think JJ couldn't, couldn't be, and I think the
*  energy is a great point. I think he is a leader. And I do not diminish his preexisting relationship
*  with LeBron James, albeit on a podcast, but dude, it helps. It helps. You can tell that LeBron,
*  he started here on second base with LeBron James and we've watched LeBron run through
*  coaches in his career, Bill. He's starting in a better, he's starting in a better place.
*  And he's raising his, his role players in the media, Austin Reeves notably. But the AD thing
*  is, is, is the headline. I mean, he currently leads the NBA in scoring. He's averaging 33 and 12.
*  He's ruined the, I mean, he's played the Suns twice and Nurkic for whatever reason,
*  he just demolishes Nurkic. They don't, so we'll see when we get to some other centers, but
*  offense defense, he's been great. He looks like the guy when we're writing about him in Grantland,
*  he looks like the guy we all thought he was going to be in 2013 and 2014 when he was this
*  youngster in New Orleans. In fact, his usage rate is higher right now, speaking to JJ and running
*  the team through Anthony Davis, his usage rate hasn't been this high since he's gotten to Los
*  Angeles. So the numbers back up the idea too, that the team is running through Anthony Davis
*  and it's working early. He's one of the best two way players in the league when he is healthy.
*  And you mentioned this earlier, but he's got to stay healthy. And what, one of the things I would
*  say is he, he's looked healthy since the Olympics. He, he, he, he, it looks sustainable. I don't want
*  to, I don't want it. Yeah, that's true. I don't want to jinx anything. But he looks like he is,
*  is a reliable sort of a sustainable presence in this rotation.
*  You know, there's one other thing going on with this team that I didn't realize fully until
*  I was watching them. Cause I, I, they've actually been pretty fun to watch. I took the under for
*  them at 42 and a half. I thought, you know, new coach, LeBron, uh, hitting age 40. Like I did so
*  many good teams in the West, just didn't seem like a great bet. I went over on them the last couple
*  of years. Now their overs up to 44 and a half. And I would probably take the over on the 44 and a
*  half at that point. Here's the other reason, other than the ones we mentioned, I think the
*  LeBrony thing has been good for LeBron being part of that team. Oh, that's interesting. He,
*  I think there's a real energy and a real joy he gets from it. Um, now I sound like I'm an ESPN
*  talking head, just praising LeBron. Um, but I really think like there's just something different
*  about the investment when your son's there every night, right? And I, I, it just seems like he's
*  responded in all the right ways to it. I have no idea if it's going to last, if it's sustainable,
*  but I don't know if we're going to see some of the passive aggressive stuff that he was doing
*  the last couple of years with the roster because he seems way more invested in the roster and the
*  guys that he's playing with. That's a great point. I never thought about it. So primitive, but as a
*  dad, like it's, it's kind of harder to be a jerk to the waiter at the restaurant. If your kids
*  at the table, no, it's really true. And he's just being a pro. And you're setting a dad example.
*  You're still like, whether I know Bronnie is a grown ass man now is like 20, but he's still a
*  kid. Like my son turns 17 next week. I still look at him like he's a six year old that I'm trying
*  to teach him right from wrong. I don't know. I might be wrong, but I do, I do feel like the
*  energy from that has been a positive and I thought it was going to go the other way. I thought it was,
*  this is going to be a soap opera. This is there to be asking about every game, but it really seems
*  like they've navigated correctly. Bronnie's there probably in the G league. He's definitely not going
*  to help that team in any way this year, but I think he's been good to have around. I think it's,
*  it's given everybody a boost. It's weird. I love that take. And I think, you know, the other thing
*  is he is starting to slip. You know, he needed a late three in that Phoenix game and I know they
*  lost to get the 10 points just to keep his 3000 year old streak of 10 points in every game alive.
*  He needed to hit that three pointer. I think again, we're overreacting here. It's week one,
*  but you know, LeBron's going to have more and more nights like this. This is what it's going to look
*  like. And JJ to his credit saw this and was like, I gotta get more out of AD if this is going to work.
*  And AD is leading the league and points in the pain, as we said, leading the league and points
*  per game. And you know, it's a kindler, gentler, LeBron James, whatever, but this is very encouraging.
*  And I know you're a Celtics guy, but the league is more interesting when the Lakers are good.
*  And JJ looks to have righted the ship here a little bit in Los Angeles.
*  And Davis is really hard to play against defend Handel, right? He's, when he's playing at this
*  level, he's one of the six, seven best guys in the league. It makes me think like, I, you know,
*  they have some, some draft capital, they have some young players, there's some sort of move they could
*  make. Obviously D'Angelo Russell is going to be on eBay for the next four months as they shop him
*  to anybody. But it makes me think like, if I'm them, the way Davis is playing combined with that,
*  you still have LeBron on the team this year and next year, maybe you do sacrifice one of those
*  extra assets. Cause I look at the West and okay, okay. See in the Celtics to me are levitating
*  above everybody else in the league. It's like they're in their own league. Then it's a drop off.
*  And the Lakers with, you know, one more guy, especially if it was a point guard slash shooter,
*  I think if Davis is going to play like this, you have to think you could swim in that pool.
*  I didn't think they could swim in that pool a month ago.
*  No, I I'm with you. I think one of the, my first piece for the ringers should come out this week,
*  but we're looking at depth and I'm arguing the depth Bill Simmons is the new MVP of the NBA.
*  And it's harder to achieve in this new CBA. But when we look at what separates the Celtics and
*  the Thunder right now and teams like the Wolves is that they go seven, eight, nine deep. And that
*  is very hard. That is, that is evidence of a very good front office. And that is what we're seeing
*  separating the teams. Cause everybody has a superstar now it seems all the contender,
*  I have one or two superstars. Okay, cool. What do you have? And what you talked about in Milwaukee
*  and what we talked about in Denver is they don't have that the Lakers and sons also struggle a
*  little bit in that department. Would you put the Knicks in there? The Knicks are pretty good in
*  depth. Obviously I think they're, they're starting fives about putting them in the not enough depth
*  camp. Yeah. So it depends on what you define depth. I think they're fourth and fifth guys are great,
*  but below that Deuce McBride, we're asking a lot of Deuce McBride now. Once Mitchell Robinson
*  gets back, I think they're relatively deep. But I brought this up because you said there's Boston
*  and OKC and I think that's what it is. And when you look at depth, it's those guys by a long shot.
*  I mean, when you're talking about Peyton Pritchard and Sam Houser and Al Horford coming off your
*  bench, that's a different world than these struggling teams with superstars, or including
*  the Lakers have in those slots. That's why I loved OKC's over under one seed,
*  every bet that had them winning the West and winning 60 plus games. But I also ended up going
*  over with the Celtics too, because they, when you have, we can give this guy a day off depth.
*  That's like the last frontier of depth. The Celtics and OKC could basically, it's like OKC lost
*  Hartenstein for five weeks. They're like, all right, next guy up. And they have guys,
*  you know, and you watch like the way Wiggins and Wallace have been playing in this first week and
*  they go deep with dudes that can come in and actually flip a game, which is what the Celtics
*  have too. So the Lakers though, if they get, if Connect can become something of a guy for them,
*  like a 15 to 18 minute ninth man type guy. And if Rui, if this is real and I don't trust Rui at all,
*  but maybe this is a little bit real. And then one more trade, like they might actually have enough
*  depth to sustain LeBron games like last night, where it's just like, oof, he looks 40 tonight.
*  I'll represent Rui. Rui's a shooter, man. Rui can fill it up. And LeBron is one of the best
*  three point creators the world's ever seen. They just need a couple other guys around that.
*  But Rui can shoot the ball and if Connect, like you said, if he becomes a reliable off ball threat,
*  I think they can have a good offense. And with AD, they're going to be in good shape on defense.
*  So if I gave you, I know it's too early, eight playoff teams, OKC, Minnesota, Phoenix, would
*  you have all three of those in? Definitely. And Dallas? Oh yeah. That's four, those are four
*  definites. Any team I name after that, you'd be like, I don't know, they might be a playing team,
*  including Denver. He's like, I don't know, they might be a seventh seed. Eh, if Jokic got her for
*  12 games, that might be a 41 and 41 team. Until Stefan got her, Golden State was looking good too.
*  And I think the West and the Houston, who knows what we have there? Who knows if Wembe's going
*  to turn it on? Yeah, the second half of the West is going to be a lot of the five through five through
*  12. Yeah, five through 12. I don't think San Antonio is here. Sacramento, I would have been if they
*  had beaten the Lakers like they should have on Saturday night where they're just in control of
*  the first three quarters. And then LeBron just leaves his body for 20 minutes and just puts the
*  game. That was unbelievable. All right. What's your fourth thing? Well, let's, I got two Eastern
*  Conference ones. I'll save the Celtics for last. We're going to go to Cleveland. I think Cleveland,
*  you mentioned Orlando. I love this point. I think these small market teams emerging in the Eastern
*  Conference, Indiana, Orlando, but I'm going to talk about Cleveland. I think they all have a
*  chance to sort of upset the Knicks and Sixers and slide in. One of those teams could slide into that
*  two slot. And if I had to say right now, I like all three of them. Indiana has been off to a rocky
*  start, hasn't looked great a couple of times. If I had to pick one right now, I'm picking Kenny and
*  the Cavaliers. I'm picking the Cleveland Cavaliers, Bill. They're 4-0. They've won handily.
*  They had a good roster to begin with. It felt like they were underachieving for a minute there.
*  You remember a couple of years ago, it felt like they were on the brink of becoming sort of
*  perennial contenders. Last year, I thought that way. Yeah. But I think they're a really good two-way
*  team. Jared Allen is a monster. Evan Mobley gives you two rim protectors on the court at the same
*  time. And obviously, they're backcourt. If Darius Garland is as good as this, and he's had a hot
*  start. He was great in New York. But if Darius Garland is playing this well, and Donovan Mitchell
*  is playing this well, they're as good as anybody competing for that second spot in the East.
*  And I do believe in Kenny Atkinson. And I do believe that this Cavaliers team might be
*  a surprise two or three seed in that Eastern Conference. The Mitchell signing with them long
*  term, I think, really helps. The fact that Garland's healthy this year really helps.
*  Knicks game, granted, first week of the season. Not going to overreact to it. But I like that they
*  went in there and fucking, they were up five, up six, the whole second half of the fourth quarter.
*  And they just, that was it. They got stopped. Brunson missed a couple shots that he normally
*  makes. But they had a real hard time stopping Garland. And there was a couple moments near the
*  end where Garland had the ball. And Mitchell threw him the car keys a couple times and
*  let him do stuff. I also, this is one of the reasons we were so high in them in the over-under
*  pod. And I have a lot of Cleveland bets. I have them for the division. They've been playing together
*  now for a couple of years, which I think it's the most simple point you could possibly make.
*  But I do think it matters. Like these guys, it's really hard to have any kind of continuity in the
*  NBA anymore. So I see that with them. And then Orlando is the other one that they have Palo,
*  who's better than anyone on the Cavs, I think. Apologies to Donva Mitchell, but Palo's talent
*  ceiling, I would put higher than anyone on the Cavs roster. And then this Anthony Black thing
*  that happened last night was Joel. They put him out there in crunch time. He made two big threes.
*  He gives them size. They weren't afraid to go to him when it mattered. And that was kind of a game
*  changer for me because I was like, Oh, I wasn't, I didn't know he was coming to the party. I like the
*  magic anyway. So I don't know. I'd like both of those teams, certainly more than Philly as a regular
*  season team and certainly more than Milwaukee as a regular season team.
*  Well, if the best ability is availability, then Orlando has more abilities than those two older
*  teams in Philadelphia and Milwaukee. So yeah, I think when we talk about depth, Orlando is in
*  that conversation. They just have different looks they can throw at you. They seem to be really
*  willful defenders up and down the roster. I like that team a lot. And I think because they're in a
*  small market, nobody talks about the magic, just like the Cavs. The ringer talks about the magic
*  because we have Steve Cerruti on board. So we've done, we've been carrying most of the ringer,
*  the magic national torch. Now that the Lakers are good, nobody's ever going to talk about the magic
*  on any national TV station. Well, who do you, who do you like better if you had to overreact to one
*  way Cleveland or Orlando for sneaking into the tour, the three seed in the Eastern Conference?
*  Good question. Thank you for asking. I thought Cleveland really had a chance to be the two seed
*  and I'm not surprised by what's happened with them because I just thought they were going to be good.
*  I wasn't prepared for the Palo leap that I feel like might be happening. To me last night, he
*  looked a lot like Tatum, like year five, year six, Tatum, figuring out stuff at the foul line,
*  top of the key, how to set up other guys, how to know what the right time is to just, oh, I'm just
*  going to the basket now. I have Elaine versus like, oh, I'm going to pull this double team over and
*  find somebody. I thought there were a lot of similarities with those guys. And I didn't know
*  if Palo a hundred percent had that in him yet, cause he's so young. Like that took Tatum
*  probably until the 2022 playoffs to even really hint at becoming that guy in a real way. I felt
*  like Palo's like might be that guy now. I was just blown away by the game he had yesterday.
*  Granted it's against Indiana, Indiana sucks defensively. I get it. But that was a higher
*  level than I was expecting. Yes. I don't mean to just agree with you on that, but it's totally
*  true. I was not ready for a 50 point game from Palo. 50 points with like nine rebounds down.
*  Nine rebounds, nine assists. It's a crazy stat line. He has tremendous feel for the game. And
*  then when you watch him in person, it does feel like he's going to be one of these guys. The game
*  slows down for he makes the right read. He makes the right play. He can go get his own. He can make
*  people around him better. And the good news for Orlando is the guys, there's a really good
*  supporting cast already in place there. We talked about KCP enough in this podcast, but that's a
*  nice ad to have on the perimeter of veteran who knows how to win. And you know, I think
*  because that is the magic. The thing that jumps out with them is how competitive those dudes are.
*  Suggs is another borderline. If you're doing your all NBA sociopath team, I think he would have to
*  be first team guard. He's a maniac. Like Black hit that go ahead three and he ran over to him
*  during the time out and he's just like screaming at him like he was like a boxing hype man or
*  something. He's a maniac, but that's how that whole team is wired that way.
*  Yeah, I think so. And so I think it's going to be, I think they're deeper than the calves,
*  which I love the calves roster. I think there's a little bit of weakness in Cleveland at the wing
*  position. I liked how they use Dean Wade to guard Brunson a little bit, but I wish they had another
*  sort of three and D wing in that starting group or in their rotation to go to. But yeah, I think those
*  two teams aren't getting enough respect. And if the first week is an indie, any indication that
*  might change here in the first month of the season bill. I, so Franz only played 11 minutes in the
*  game yesterday and it, and they were able to, to kind of, I'm looking at the minutes now still
*  feels like they're one guy short in that Gary Harris, Jed Howard kind of area. But I also feel
*  like there's a lot of trade bait possibilities to this team. It's also a team that has all their
*  picks. So there's moves that they can make, but if you were going to give me Orlando and Cleveland
*  on this end and Philly and Milwaukee on the other end, I would just pick the Orlando Cleveland thing,
*  not just for the regular season, but for playoffs too. I love young durability, like and
*  competitiveness. Those are all things that we know works. It worked with OKC last year. Every time we
*  say no, no, they're not going to be ready yet. It always happens a year earlier than a year later. So
*  the Palo piece though, remember last year they lose the game seven and the excuse after the game,
*  which is, wasn't even really an excuse. It was like, man, that too much on Palo too much. He
*  had to create everything. It was such a burden on him. Last time he looked like he was, he was like,
*  I've spent the whole summer being ready to be the guy and now I'm going to be ready for this. But
*  yeah, he's better, certainly better than I ever thought he was going to be. Remember we were
*  talking about him versus Chet versus Jabari. I don't think anybody saw this. I know people love
*  Palo, but nobody saw like what happened last night. So Rudy, did anyone see this with Palo? Like even
*  like the most bullish crazy Palo fan, did anyone see what happened last night as a ceiling?
*  I think Rosillo before the draft, because I mean, infamously, I guess I was a Chet guy. I
*  still feel good about Chet. Not a bad opinion. He's going to be a good player. I think that's fine.
*  My thing is I just feel like both teams got the player that they probably needed long term. But
*  no, I mean, I think the thing that the worry about Palo was like, was he going to be like this
*  inefficient, mellow type scorer? And I think, you know, early on so much was thrust upon him that
*  like, he was like, oh no, is this going to be like just a high volume everything guy?
*  And that's why I got so defensive in the playoffs last year about the turnovers. Because I'm like,
*  cool. He's playing in this hostile Cleveland environment. And in his second year where he's
*  arguably at times the best player on the floor, as you said, Donovan Mitchell has an argument,
*  but like that's wild stuff. Like that's, there are not that many guys in the history of the
*  league that have been asked to do that and have like met the challenge in year two. So,
*  you know, I think everybody thought he was going to put up numbers, but like,
*  was the efficiency and the winning going to be behind it? So that's the question of that.
*  It's coming this early. That's what's so crazy about it.
*  Yeah. What is he 20? He's 22, right? Yes. Yeah. That I, it feels like the basketball,
*  the sport of basketball has slowed down for him a tiny bit. And this is why it's so dangerous
*  to do the overreactions after week one. I don't think that's an overreaction. Like he, you can
*  tell sometimes when a guy has gone from point B to point C or point D to point D, whatever,
*  it feels like he's at a different point of whatever the journey was than he was in that
*  Cleveland series. 22 in two weeks, by the way. So still wow. Oh my God. I don't Kirk. Where's
*  he in the trade value rankings now? I 21 year old with a 50 point game is pretty high.
*  Like he's gotta be like top five to seven now.
*  I got down now makes me want to do another rankings. I think you had to do it.
*  I had him eight, but I think he's gotta be higher. Like to me, Palo versus Edwards,
*  I would have had Edwards ahead of him. No question last summer. And now it's like, all right, I gotta
*  really sit down and sketch this out and look at their ages. And I just, cause we saw it happen with
*  the Celtics last year, you can build an actual championship team around a guy with this specific
*  set of skills. The difference is he's not as good of a defender as Tatum is at least not yet. Tatum
*  Tatum was always like a really good defensive player. Did you expect that Anthony black hitting
*  the two threes piece of the season? I mean, I don't want to toot my own horn, but like kind of.
*  So I was, I literally called Rossello after the game last night, cause we were both so excited
*  about it. And I was calling for Anthony black to play in the playoffs last year. I was like, what's
*  the worst that could happen? I mean, you know, nothing against Gary Harris and oh, he's not your
*  favorite player, but he's like, it can't get much worse offensively than what it was in some of those
*  games. And he's like, oh, for seven from three. So it's like, throw black out there, see what could
*  happen. I mean, when he was coming out of the draft, it was like, Hey, high IQ player, like big,
*  you know, can guard multiple positions, but like the shot is atrocious. So the fact that he's even
*  like the shot looks pretty good. And the fact that he's making them semi consistently and two, as you
*  said, two big threes last night that he's going to be a factor. He should be a factor. And I, I'm,
*  you throw like trade shifts. I mean, it depends who the guy is, but like, I'm kind of, I'm holding
*  that guy close to the vest. Yeah. Cause he fits in with the identity of the have, as you know,
*  Kirk, you know, I'm the body language doctor. I thought it was very instructive. How Orlando's
*  bench was reacting to the black threes. That's right. They, they were fucking losing their shit.
*  It was like combination. We love this guy, but also like, yo, if he's going to make those holy
*  shit, we might actually be really good this year. So I thought I was really encouraging when what I
*  know Franz left the game last night. What, what's the Franz updates? Rudy? I don't, it doesn't seem
*  like it's anything serious, but, uh, but what has he looked to heading into this? Like, did he carry
*  over the Germany love or no? So here's the thing is like, Paulo's become a better shooter, a more
*  efficient shooter. Suggs has improved his three point shooting every single year. I mean, he's
*  like a 40% three point. You're taking like what over five a game or something. It's absurd.
*  Anthony black has become a better shooter. We can't, who's co we can't get this guy to figure
*  out Franz's shot. Who's the, who's the shooting coach? I don't know. I should know the name, but
*  he's the one guy where it's like, what's kind of going on. And it is a little weird. Like he's
*  kind of like Suggs is kind of ascending to that number two guy. Oh, wow. Not, not, not in points.
*  It'll never be in points, but just as like an all around feel for the game because of the defensive
*  end. Uh, you know, I, I still believe in Franz. I think it's going to be fine, but it is a, it is a
*  little weird because everybody else seems to be like kind of growing, especially in the shooting
*  department. He's the one that's kind of regressed. So if you, if black comes through for you, maybe
*  you don't need Dennis Schroeder because he, he was auditioning for you this week with the 29 point
*  game. It's like, we're good. We're good. Unless it's an obvious, unless it's an obvious upgrade.
*  There's not, I, I, I like the core man. This team loves playing that's, and you mentioned the Suggs
*  thing and him running over to Anthony black, like they genuinely love playing with each other. Like
*  that's the winds are great. It's cool. But the vibes are just that there's, there might not be a
*  better vibe. Seemingly Suggs is like a Wolf of wall street character. Kirk, when you were in front
*  of the office, did you guys that you were with the Spurs, did they, did they like look for stuff
*  like bench chemistry, bench reactions as something that actually mattered?
*  Dude, I remember when we drafted Derek, uh, in whatever year that was, we watched all of his
*  clips for when he got fouls called on him and we watched his body language reacting to all the
*  ref calls against him. And we didn't like, he was very demonstrative after all of these calls. It
*  was, he was like one of these guys that, but yeah, body language is really important,
*  to people like pop and RC, of course. So you, you, you try to gain insights into the psyche
*  and competitive nature of all of these guys. And the body language doctors known this for years.
*  But yeah, we, we watch that stuff. We, one of the reasons you scout and you go to games or early
*  bill is you watch how guys warm up, you interact with their coaches, you talk to, you see how these
*  guys are as employees, as teammates, as leaders, as followers. That stuff is very important.
*  And I agree with Saruti, the vibes in this group, maybe with the exception of Gary Harris, am I
*  allowed to say that? It feels like they love each other. They're young, they're, they're, they're
*  fun loving. I wouldn't trade anybody by the way, including Gary Harris. But I think this team has
*  the body language doctor I would, I would confer with, but it feels like they would be near hit
*  near his, the top of his power rankings. No question. I think they're right in the same spot.
*  Okay. See was in last year. Let's see how well we can do. Let's see how many wins we can bank.
*  Let's let Palo cook. Everything's a bonus. Can we get to round two? Can we, can we put together
*  some playoff wins, but let's not really figure out what we have until the next off season would be my
*  recommendation. You want to talk about the Celtics? What do you got?
*  I have to talk. It's what I've been writing about for 10 years now with you and other places and in
*  books is like, these guys are elevating three points shooting to another level. Like
*  if we go from the splash brothers to the Dantoni hardened industrial complex in Houston, we think
*  it can't get any higher. Your team, Bill Simmons is taking it higher. They are shooting over 50 threes
*  a game and they're making 43% of them. I'm not sure either of those numbers are sustainable,
*  but I'm not copping out here. I expect this team to break three points shooting records by the end
*  of the season. I think they'll break the record for most attempts and most makes. And Missoula ball
*  has not only won a championship, but it's doing it by extending Daryl Morey and Stephen Curry's
*  legacy deep into the 2020s and, and, and proving once and for all the three point revolution isn't
*  dead. In fact, the best teams in the league are still finding ways to leverage three point shooting
*  and profound new ways. So your team, I think is becoming the new splash brothers or sort of
*  hardened rockets. It's like the splash family. Yeah. It was interesting. Last night they brought
*  against the bucks. They brought in Jordan Walsh and I was like, what the fuck, man, this guy,
*  he's not a good enough three point shooter. It doesn't fit into our system. And he took a couple.
*  We missed a couple, but, but it's surprising when they play anyone. Yeah. Well, it's shocking when
*  they put anyone in who can't make an open three, you know, and they have an embarrassment of riches
*  all over the place. It's, it's a, the three point shooting, the fact that they don't have poor
*  Zingas and you don't even really notice, they just have so much depth that now they're paying for the
*  depth. They're going to have a crazy luxury tax bill. I love, I love what I've seen from Tatum
*  and Brown early on Tatum fixed the hitch, which thank God, I think he's a legitimate MVP candidate.
*  Michael Pena wrote about that for the ringer.com today. And I completely agree if, if they're
*  going to be in the sixties for wins, you ought to really seriously look at whoever the best player
*  is. But I love everything I've seen from Tatum. And then Jaylen, I feel like has taken all the
*  shit that he was doing last year. And it's maybe even like just a hair better. And the two of them
*  together, it's everything Steve Kerr always told me about the year after you win the title, that
*  first two months, the next season, you're just like, you're so locked in, you have so much
*  confidence. And that's, that's, it's gotten to the point, like I would be surprised when they lose,
*  you know, which I feel the same way about OKC. We're like, Oh, OKC lost last night. That's usually
*  when you know, you have a 60 win team. It's like, Whoa, shit. The Celtics lost two in a
*  row. Like it's shocking. Yeah. Yeah. And I think like when Sam, Sam Hauser, but I mean,
*  Peyton Pritchard scores 28 points. That's a classic indicator too. I think when you have
*  a bench player come out and just change a game like that, and somebody who could, you would
*  count on doing that more than once or twice a month. Yeah. And I just think they are the
*  deepest team in the NBA, not to beat a dead horse, but as you, as you mentioned earlier,
*  it's the three point depth in particular. If you want to play for, for Joe Missoula,
*  you have to be able to shoot from 25 feet. You have to, you have to want to shoot it.
*  He gets mad at his players when they don't shoot them, which is kind of the mentality
*  that you need to have is a lot of guys in the league want to pass up those shots.
*  And he actually reprimands this guys and you'll hear them talking about,
*  he gets mad when we pass up an open look. That's very different than what was happening just 10
*  years ago around this league. But I think they're going to break records and three points shooting
*  potentially offensive efficiency again. And, and challenge conventional wisdom further.
*  How many threes can we do here? I think over half of their shots are three point shots at
*  this point, which is crazy. Yeah. So you figure they're taking 53 as a game
*  in making 40% of them. That's 20, that's 23 as a game, right? 82 games in a year. So
*  could they get to like 1700 threes for the season? Like it's conceivable. I don't know
*  what the record is, but I guarantee nobody's ever had 1600. Do they have five guys shooting
*  seven or more in a game right now? I think clay Thompson's only done seven or more in a game,
*  like half of his years in the NBA. So it's like, it's like a normal clay Thompson year,
*  but they have five of them. So it is sort of like the splash family.
*  And it is to the, you don't, I remember first talking about this two years ago,
*  but there was some dialogue about it the last couple of days on the internets,
*  that there's a sameness to all of these styles now that becomes boring during the regular season.
*  I don't, I'm so used to it now. It doesn't seem any different to me. And I still feel like there's
*  enough aberration type of players ranging from, you know, John Morant to Cam Thomas to,
*  there's some post-up guys. We still have like the Shungun types. It's still,
*  it doesn't feel like just everybody's checking up threes. We'll see who wins,
*  but do you see any of that? Yeah, I play both sides of that. I think the, there's never been
*  this much talent in the league. And ultimately that's why I turn on the TV set. I love watching
*  the guys, but I'd love to see the NBA move the line. I think it's time to move the line. I think
*  the shot has become too easy for too many guys. I've been really vocal about that. I think the
*  first time I wrote about it was in 2014 at Grantland after the Spurs won the title. And I think it's
*  only, I don't say it's ugly. I don't want to say that, but I think the shot has become too easy
*  for too many. And I'd like to see it a little more difficult for the average player. And it's
*  only going to make Stephen Curry and Damian Lillard more valuable or Jason Tatum, guys who can shoot
*  from deeper will become more valuable in a world where the shot's harder. So I think it actually
*  celebrates those guys a little bit more. I don't know. I think, I don't know. What do you think?
*  You think it's okay. You think everything is hunky dory. You don't think it's too many threes. I always
*  joke, Bill, that it should be called the two point line. Once we take more than half of our shots
*  from behind it. But yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm eager to hear what you think on this one, actually.
*  I, this is the first time I've seriously started thinking about, do we
*  have to fix the corner three a little bit? Do you make the arc, you change it a little bit. So when
*  it goes right to the corner, maybe the line goes so that a corner three no longer exists. And you
*  have to be three, four feet over from the corner for it to be a corner three. That that would be
*  the only thing that I could see five, six years from now. If they're going to tweak it, I could
*  see the whole arc of the three point line, instead of it just being like almost like a semi-circle,
*  the way it looks now being different where it kind of, it hits the corner in a way that you corner
*  threes are gone. It goes up higher so that like the peak of it is like 28 feet instead of 24 or
*  whatever. And, and maybe that's where we're heading. But I also, I don't, I don't know if that would
*  help the product because then it's like just guys heaving these long shots and these long rebounds.
*  And I think that would cause too many unintended consequences, but you could tell me like, could
*  they experiment with the corner three for pre-season, see what it looks like? I wouldn't be
*  against it. I don't think I've ever shared this, but in 2019, after my book came out,
*  Adam Silver had reached out to me and said, will you come present some of this stuff to the, to the
*  league? And, and we had suggested two different three point lines. We got to the competition
*  committee and we were going to try it in the G league, Bill. We're going to try two or three
*  different looks in the G league. And I'd love for them to revisit. One was to get rid of the corner
*  three entirely, which is very drastic. And in fact, I think it was Brad Stevens, who was on the
*  competition committee. He was like, hell no. You'll never see a slam dunk again. This is going to
*  ruin spacing. So, you know, you have to see it. You have to see how the league reacts to these things
*  because it could end up making the product worse. Like hand up, like some of these ideas might not
*  be good ideas for the product. And I think the better one is to keep the corners where they are,
*  but extend the three point arc, which is currently 23.75. Get it out to 25 or 26 feet, like you
*  described. But again, you're exactly right. Does that just mean we're watching more miss threes,
*  the same number of threes, but fewer makes? Cause that's not great. So I think we'd have to see it
*  in practice to see what it would look like before we would sort of engineer the right product.
*  What I would say is every other league on the planet that matters, the W college basketball
*  fee, but they've all moved the line back this century. The NBA is the only one that hasn't.
*  But yeah, I think that's going to be a bigger conversation as your Celtics continue to rain
*  down, uh, dozens of threes on their opponent on a nightly basis.
*  One other thing I was thinking is maybe there's a limit for threes.
*  Once you make 20, you just can only make two pointers from that point on you basically used
*  up your 20 and that's it. Like maybe that's where it goes. That would be awesome. I think
*  you kind of like that one. I like that one. I like it. It's like, I don't like timeouts.
*  Uh, sorry, that's your last three. So I hope you're ready to post up porzingis for the rest of the
*  game. You know, it's going to be, it would be wild to see how teams would change their offense.
*  Yeah. Maybe they wouldn't shoot threes in the, in the first quarter. We didn't, I don't feel like we
*  vehemently disagreed on anything. Do you have anything you want to vehemently disagree on?
*  Because unfortunately we see a lot of basketball the same way. Um, I'll just throw a couple things
*  out of you and you can tell me if you vehemently disagree. Ryan Dunn
*  in the running for most impactful rookie.
*  They knew this kid could defend. They knew the kid could defend the shot is a, let's just say,
*  uh, a work in progress. And I think it's way better. Dude, Lou Dort, same thing. Right now,
*  Lou Dort makes a lot of money because why he made the shot work. So I think this kid could be a
*  long-term NBA player, a rotation player for a very good Phoenix team, but he's got to be able to
*  start making some shots. Yeah. So I think if he's, if his three point shot is real, um,
*  that was the only question in my mind. The defense was NBA ready. Um, so I think,
*  I think they got something if the, if he's making those threes,
*  my guy, Eddie Johnson, that cranky Homer, who's also on serious XM radio, he was,
*  he flagged the Ryan Dunn thing like a month ago. And he was like, and he, he, he's, we have like a
*  really fun relationship, but he was so adamant and excited about how good this kid was in preseason.
*  I was like, I don't feel like Eddie's making this up. Like he, he's like super duper duper excited.
*  And it turns out like, you know, you see him out there and crunch time for them. Interesting
*  wrinkle for them. I still don't, I don't know what they're going to do about a center and I'm
*  not sure it's going to matter in the regular season. I still think they'll get to a 50 plus
*  wins. All right. Next. I'll try to start one more argument here. Um, Chicago,
*  a more pleasant league pass experience than you were expecting.
*  I think DeMar DeRozan is not there anymore. And I don't know if it's the Ewing theory or
*  the DeMar theory or whatever you want to say here. They're definitely playing harder on defense.
*  Um, Kobe white feels like a more enjoyable presence. The more time he's getting in this
*  offense, the more he's, he's a fun guy. Zach Levine, maybe not Vucevic. Uh, you know, I,
*  I don't know. Um, what are you going to say? I'll say no. I think I'm going to say no.
*  If I have five games to watch and they're probably not in my four box, you know what I mean? I'll
*  just say no. And for the sake of starting an argument, they were a cross-off for me as a league
*  pass team, but I actually like the ball, the giddy Vucevic still feels like there's this little tiny
*  foreign center thing to be unlocked with him with passing at the top of the key.
*  And now guys are moving around. It's not so like old school DeRosa gets the ball and everybody
*  kind of stands around. I don't know about they're on my radar. They have some players I like watching
*  I and, uh, and I I'm still rooting for giddy to, to become a guy. Cause I like, I just think he's so
*  different than all the other players. It's like, we need, you need weird players to succeed like
*  him with his kind of skillset. So, um, we'll see, uh, could cam Thomas lead the league in scoring
*  for real. I think the number has to be at least 32 a game. Cause there's no way Luca goes under 32
*  a game. The only, the only way I would happen is if Dallas is just blowing teams out and he's not
*  playing the same minutes per game. He's just an established 33 a game now. So let's say he drops
*  to 32. I think that's the number. There is a way, but I think it's very, very unlikely, but
*  Brooklyn in part because Brooklyn's playing better than I thought they would be billed.
*  They're playing harder. They're, they got a new coach too. And it looks like they have new vibes.
*  They're frisky and they're frisky and all Ben Simmons jokes aside, like he's looked okay.
*  And he just won't shoot. He doesn't. And they have to take them out with six minutes left. Cause he's
*  just not going to ever want to take a foul shot ever. It is wild. Uh, but cam Thomas is a, not
*  afraid to shoot. Uh, Mr. Greenlight. I think there's a path there, but I would, I would be
*  shocked. I would say this is Lucas. This is Lucas. So the money on Luca. Well, they're playing
*  tonight after we taped this. So you talked about American stars being worried about them counter
*  lot of American stars. I like watching right now. Tatum and Brown, Edwards, Palo Brunson, Halliburton,
*  Ja LaMelo rumors of a Lamello comeback Booker and Fox, Mitchell Zion when he plays. Um,
*  yeah, last time we talked about the Americans. Well, so are the casinos. I noticed that, uh,
*  both Jason Tatum and the, uh, and Anthony Davis have rightfully surged up the MVP futures list.
*  Right. Uh, and I think, I think Tatum is playing better. He looks a lot better, you know,
*  than anybody when he's, he's taken good shots and they're going in the three point shots,
*  especially, uh, Ja Morant. LaMelo has been one of the best stories of the first week,
*  again, new coach, new vibes. I think that's one of the themes of our podcast today.
*  And Charlotte has new coach, new vibes. And he, he's benefited from that. And I can't wait to see
*  him and Brandon Miller playing together, but, um, yeah, Tatum is five to one, by the way,
*  he was 13 to one before the season started and it's dropped now to five to one third best dots.
*  There you go. And I think, Hey, as a hardworking American myself, I love to watch Americans
*  dominate. You counted out the Americans. I don't know. Um, Houston needs to make a trade. Yes or
*  no. Houston has one of the weirdest rosters in the league. I need to see a little bit more,
*  but for the sake of argument, yes, they have tradable pieces. I'm not sure which of these
*  young players is really going to stay there. It doesn't feel like Shangoon and Jaylen Breen should
*  be on the same basketball team. Uh, Fred Van Fleet, Dylan Mitchell. Yeah, I just, they, they
*  couldn't be. And then one of the cool things about weird, you said weird basketball guys,
*  like these are guys that the fact that they're on the same team and they're from such different
*  parts of the world and they play well together, but Freddie Van Fleet, Dylan Brooks, like these
*  guys are just, how are they all on the same team? So yeah, I'll go with yes. Um, they need to make
*  some changes there. I think there are two for one or three for one, but I felt that way before the
*  season. Memphis is not a playoff team.
*  I'm just throwing that out there for argument's sake. I don't, I'm not saying whether I believe
*  it or not. I can get there. I'll just for the sake of argument, I say they are a playoff team.
*  I think they have too much talent. I don't think they're as good as they were a few years ago.
*  I think Steven Adams remains sort of an unheralded piece of their success from two years ago with
*  just the physicality and the rebounding, particularly the second chance points that they
*  really just depended on. Um, and, and we'll see what Edie can do. Um, but I think there are six
*  seed. I think the Memphis Grizzlies are going to be the six seed, the last non-playing team in the
*  West. If I had to say, I'm less bullish on them than I was. And I went to under on their over under
*  cause I thought it was too high, but, um,
*  this is why it's the first week of the season. I'm, I'm just watching them. I,
*  I'll have a harder opinion than them in the 20 game. Are you worried about New Orleans yet,
*  by the way? A little bit, but this Jordan Hawkins kid has caught my eye and, uh, he looks like a
*  natural shooter. Yeah. What do they do? It just feels like he needs to play. He needs to play.
*  And I mean, I don't know if that factors into the Ingram decision they have or, or trying to get
*  off of that, but dude, I love that kid. And he looks like a shooter, like one of the best jump
*  shooters early in this season. Uh, and it doesn't look like an accident. He was one of the best
*  shooters coming out of the draft. I'm not worried about them. Um, I'm always worried about Zion
*  staying healthy. Um, but I'm not worried about them. I think they're going to figure it out.
*  Um, but they have like a couple of pieces. They just need to figure out rotations in my opinion.
*  What are your thoughts? Too early. I want to, uh, I'm with you in Hawkins. I just feel I was
*  talking to somebody about it today. Somebody has to be disappointed in the West. We're not going
*  to have 11 playoff teams. There's gotta be somebody who, when we get to mid December, we're like,
*  Holy shit. I can't believe that team is, you know, 10 and 15. It's going to be somebody. And I have
*  a couple suspects, but I want to watch for another week. The Clippers being a little, uh, better,
*  at least in week one than I expected is another monkey wrench. Cause I just had them penciled in
*  as a bottom three team, but Hardin, Hardin is like, this is great. I have the ball all the time.
*  They have a bunch of defensive guys who are like, this is great. Hardin has the ball all the time.
*  All I have to do is worry about this. And then norm pals like, this is great. Every once in a while,
*  they just let me cook. So I still don't know if they're good, but I am also a little concerned
*  that cause that was one of my locks. I had them under 37 and a half. I'm a little concerned. They
*  might be more of a professional basketball team than that. Well, Ty Lou is a great coach. And I
*  think James Horton's in his happy place. He sort of alluded to it. He seems super pumped. Undeniably
*  the leader of the team right now. And you know, if he feels that way and Ty lose the coach and
*  their defense is playing like this. Yeah, I agree. Like you're saying there's six guaranteed spots.
*  There's the two play in playoff spots of four play in teams. I think Denver, Denver and the Clippers,
*  I think I would say a plan team that that's probably my biggest overreaction from week one.
*  I find it hard to believe they're going to be one of the six best teams in the West. Cause I
*  don't know what the fixes are for them. Milwaukee. You can talk yourself into it a little faster
*  because the East is such a, you know, once you get past the top eight, it's just, there's seven
*  crummy teams in there. But, uh, have you, have you been to the Intuit, uh, facility yet? No,
*  I'm going this weekend. Okay. We look forward to report. I hope it's, I hope it's a better
*  experience than the Atlas.
