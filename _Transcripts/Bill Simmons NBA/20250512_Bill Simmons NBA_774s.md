# What Happens to the Celtics after Jayson Tatumâ€™s Devastating Injury? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU)
*  Tonight was not a good night for Celtic fans. Holy shit. Uh, really tough loss in MSG. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=0.0s)]
*  I don't know how long Jake, Jay Kyle man is here. Joe house is here. We're going to talk about the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  lottery later. We're going to play off the next Celtics game as well. Not going to speculate too [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=10.48s)]
*  much on the Tatum thing, but it did not look good. It worst case scenarios and Achilles [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=14.8s)]
*  best case scenario was like torn ligaments in his ankle or some sort of bad ankle injury, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=22.56s)]
*  but either way like done for the series and God only knows for how long. What was your reaction [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=28.32s)]
*  when you saw Kyle? Did you think Achilles right away? I mean, just, I've had a lot of sports [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=33.28s)]
*  injuries, but I'm not going to pretend to know these kinds of things. But the fact that we were [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=38.4s)]
*  arguing about, you know, ankle or not, I mean, the fact that he was neutral and there was the plant [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=41.84s)]
*  and then the reverse angle where you see the pressure and then you just kind of see him, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=46.72s)]
*  his ankle just kind of wobble like the stability gave out, which made me worry. And, but you and I [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  were saying that, you know, the pain part of it was the interesting reaction because to me, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=56.0s)]
*  I've never torn that God, you know, God willing, I don't go there, but he, his reaction to it was [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=62.0s)]
*  what made me think because every basketball player fears that, right? I mean, it's, it's [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=68.72s)]
*  increasingly getting more, you know, doable and navigable, but with surgery and everything, but [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=73.12s)]
*  I think his reaction was he knew that's kind of my speculation. It was, he knew what it was and it [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=78.32s)]
*  was just that like, holy shit, why me kind of a thing, less than a writhing in pain type thing. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=83.6s)]
*  Yeah. House usually with the Achilles, the guy almost doesn't seem like they knew it happened [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  and they grab like for something behind their thing. So I was, I was studying it like, well, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  he's grabbing the side of his ankle. Maybe it's not, but it doesn't look great. And the irony of it [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=100.16s)]
*  was that was one of the best games of his career up to that point. I mean, he's single-handedly [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=105.28s)]
*  kept the Celtics in that game for three plus quarters and was outrageously good. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=109.92s)]
*  That's the bummer. We were being treated finally in this game four to the mono, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  we mono that we, we basketball fans deserve. We were waiting for a Brunson game and then, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=119.92s)]
*  you know, Tatum was there to match him blow for blow shot for shot. And you know, that fourth [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=126.16s)]
*  quarter was, was, was getting very exciting down that stretch there. And that's it. It's over. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=131.76s)]
*  The season's over for the Celtics and who knows what happens over the summer and next season. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=139.04s)]
*  It looked like the Knicks were about to pull away when that play happened [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  and the irony, a normal pass to Jalen Brown, who just, you know, just didn't have it the whole [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  night. He was fouls turnovers. And for some reason, the pass just to flex off him goes back to Tatum. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=153.2s)]
*  Tatum jumps for it, has the injury, but the Knicks, you know, it was really just Tatum and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=158.88s)]
*  White tonight for the Celtics. Even before that injury, nobody else really showed up. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=163.6s)]
*  The Porzingis minutes were horrible. The two older guys, Horford and Drew Holiday, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=168.56s)]
*  brought nothing to the table. Pritchard didn't really give them the boost off the bench. And [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  then conversely Brunson was awesome. Bridges made some big, big, big little eight, 10 footers. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=177.2s)]
*  OG made a couple threes. Towns had some big minutes, even though he was getting torched [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  on defense. Robinson had a couple of rebounds. The Knicks just, God, they just looked like a [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=189.04s)]
*  better all around team up until the injury. Yeah. The Porzingis thing was really glaring. I mean, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=193.12s)]
*  in every facet he was slow to the ball on the glass, but what I noticed was, you know, on the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=198.56s)]
*  season, it was a lot of McHale Bridges, his strengths, his things that he's already pretty [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=203.68s)]
*  good at, or just being, you know, exacerbated, I think amplified in this situation where he's [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=209.36s)]
*  really good at those dribble pull-up twos. And this is something that goes back to his Phoenix days [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=213.76s)]
*  that I remember in particular, CP3 and he would kill Porzingis with that left to right where they [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=217.76s)]
*  would sort of go through the middle of the, snake through the middle of that pick and roll and get [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=224.72s)]
*  to that dribble pull-up shot. I mean, he was just killing Porzingis with that because Porzingis [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=229.04s)]
*  wasn't moving laterally really well. Horford wasn't either, but yeah, 48.1% on the season, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=232.64s)]
*  I looked it up, dribble pull-up too. So that's his strength and man, he killed him with it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=238.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. I was worried. I was really worried about this game for a bunch of different reasons, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  but the one day rest for the older guys on the, on the Celtics versus like having the home game [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=246.16s)]
*  and then having to do it again on Wednesday night. House, when you're before the injury, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=251.12s)]
*  you're watching it. And I was saying to you, I was worried about this game because the Knicks [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=256.56s)]
*  hadn't played a good game in this series yet. What were the odds they were just going to go [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=261.44s)]
*  through two weeks and not have a good game? I thought they were pretty good tonight. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=264.96s)]
*  They were good, but you know, the, the key, and I'm not here to, you know, rub it in anybody's [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=269.44s)]
*  face. If, if Porzingis isn't effective and the Celtics, it makes it super duper hard for them [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=274.48s)]
*  to compete. They just don't have enough dudes. The Hauser injury turns out to be really impactful. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=279.92s)]
*  And if Porzingis is this version of Porzingis, then it's tough because the Knicks do have [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=286.16s)]
*  six dudes. They have six. That's exactly the number. They don't have more might maybe even [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=291.36s)]
*  just called five and a half, but they are dudes. They're all dudes. And look, here's the crazy [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  thing to me. I'm looking at the numbers here. How did the Knicks get up 13 more shots? They had 13 [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=300.96s)]
*  more attempts from the field. I know that's right. They beat them by 12 on the boards. That's the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=306.88s)]
*  answer. It's crazy. Cause the turnovers were pretty even and the Celtics were getting to the free [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=312.32s)]
*  throw line. That wasn't an issue. And they both shot, you know, good from three, 38% for the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  Celtics, 35% for the Knicks. Those are good, good numbers, but 13 more attempts. Cause the Knicks [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=324.47999999999996s)]
*  own the boards and this is the second consecutive game where that happened. And you know, it just [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=330.4s)]
*  goes, it's very basic. It goes, it comes back to like, you know, your dudes, who are your dudes, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=336.0s)]
*  who's going to go get a rebound when you need it. Yeah. There was one point I looked at Tatum and [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=340.96s)]
*  Waite where I combined 13 for 25 from three. And then the Celtics were still like down by a point. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=345.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm like, that's not a good sign. If you had told me that that was going to be the number was six [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=351.52s)]
*  minutes, seven minutes left in the fourth quarter, that those two guys are going to have that. And [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=356.23999999999995s)]
*  they would still be losing. So Jalen roller coaster game, uh, before Tatum got hurt, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=359.84s)]
*  I just thought he was so good on both sides. I mean, he had, he had five steals, two blocks, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=364.96s)]
*  he's all over the place, just over and over again, attacking towns, attacking towns, attacking towns. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=370.4s)]
*  And, uh, and really kept them in it. And the irony would happen late was that it felt like [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=375.91999999999996s)]
*  this was going to be, you know, potentially another version of the Jason Tatum game. He's had a couple [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=381.2s)]
*  of those, like he had the game in Milwaukee, he had the game in Philly, but this was, I thought [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=387.04s)]
*  the best all around game I had seen him play a couple of dumb threes here and there, but for the [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=390.88s)]
*  most part, uh, was, was awesome. Did the next seem like a finals team to you, Kyle? I mean, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=395.20000000000005s)]
*  based on what's on the board. Yeah. I guess, I guess it's going to be down. Yeah. I thought, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=402.08000000000004s)]
*  I just thought it's for as brilliantly as Tatum played though, you know, he was living a tough [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=407.6s)]
*  life. I mean, you know, nine isolations on the game and a lot of it was working. If you're, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=412.48s)]
*  they talked a lot about on the broadcast that, you know, Carl is really vulnerable in drop. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=417.52000000000004s)]
*  He's really vulnerable side to side, but he is decent at kind of staying down and like, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=422.24s)]
*  he's long enough to contest. They were talking about how he bothered Durant. Tatum just kept [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=427.12s)]
*  working hard and he wasn't really getting by him. And a lot of the shots that he was getting to, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=432.0s)]
*  he was making them, but he was just kind of doing his thing where he steps backwards. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=436.96000000000004s)]
*  I don't know. It was, uh, he was, it seemed like he was burning a lot of calories to, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=442.0s)]
*  to just take tough shots. Sometimes they go in, but that's just kind of the Jason Tatum experience. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=446.48s)]
*  But Hey, if they all go in and he finishes that, yeah, I definitely think it's a, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=451.12s)]
*  it's a notch in his like legacy, you know, bullet point list. Yeah. The offense just fell apart. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=454.56s)]
*  In the last quarter and a half of the game where you could just feel it. You can feel when that [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=460.56s)]
*  the ISO ball stuff starts, the balls, they stop running plays, they stop going, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=465.36s)]
*  Oh, let's post up holiday in this player. Let's run a little pick and pop with Derek way. And it [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=469.84s)]
*  just becomes all one-on-one stuff clear out, you know, the one four kind of offense, which, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=474.64s)]
*  I don't know how I, well, that offense fed into a run by the Knicks. The Knicks scored 70 points [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=481.59999999999997s)]
*  in the second half. They had 37 points in the third quarter. Yeah. So Brunson made some great, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=487.67999999999995s)]
*  great, great shots. And the Celtics fell asleep too, a couple of times, like they left them open [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=492.88s)]
*  from three. They didn't switch over in time and they just kind of let him get into a groove. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=497.84s)]
*  Cause you can kind of always feel when he's about to go on one of his little runs, but I thought [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=502.71999999999997s)]
*  Bridges really helped too. And it, you know, I didn't think Tibbs did a good job offensively [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=507.52s)]
*  the first three games, but I thought they mixed it up better in this game. It felt like everybody [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=513.68s)]
*  was a little, a little more involved. So this kid, this could go down as we'll see what happens with [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=518.16s)]
*  Tatum, but this could go down as one of the, one of the darker Celtic days. I mean, honestly, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=525.12s)]
*  cause especially the timing of, you know, not to mention he's at the peak of his career. He's never [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=530.4s)]
*  had a major injury Tatum. And if this is like a, a major one, it doesn't just take him out for this [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=536.96s)]
*  playoffs, but it takes him out for, I think all of next year too. As you said, he is late twenties [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=545.04s)]
*  and he just wonder like, is he going to be able to get back to the point that he was at tonight? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=550.4s)]
*  So we'll find out. The shame of it is the Celtics should have just tanked down the stretch, got [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=555.44s)]
*  themselves into the play and lost in the play and gave them a half percent chances. So like a half [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=560.0s)]
*  percent, it's a miracle what happens in the NBA miracles happen. It's amazing how it shifted though, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=566.24s)]
*  from what you're talking about, Bill, like the conversation that we were, we were on this nice. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=572.8s)]
*  And if you're lucky, you get to have this conversation about your career and everything [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2lq7frNfHU&t=576.4s)]
