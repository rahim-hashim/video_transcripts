# SGA vs. Jokic, Celts-Lakers, and the State of NBA Media | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [March 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE)
*  All right. We're taping is 1230 Pacific time. Just watched. Okay. See Denver. I'm a little groggy today. We're so low. Um, okay. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=0.0s)]
*  Daylight savings combined with, uh, going to bed last night, wanted to throw something on, flip through the cable guide cause I'm old and I still flip through cable guides cast away. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=8.08s)]
*  It just started a movie I've seen a hundred thousand times. I did a solo rewatchables for, and I'm like, ah, I'll just watch the beginning. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=17.56s)]
*  And I'm up till like one 45 in the morning, which was really two 45 in the morning. And, uh, I just loved that movie, but I had to ask you, what's your cast away move coming out of the gate? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=24.720000000000002s)]
*  You're just stranded on the island. Like, do you figure out how to do a home gym? Like what about a year in what does your Island look like? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=36.44s)]
*  I've actually thought about this. Okay. Great. And I'm glad that you asked cause I, I like watching alone. It's a, it's a good fall asleep show. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  It is cause there's no music for like 50 minutes. So it's peaceful. It's just like ocean sounds. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=51.4s)]
*  And there was a guy on the most recent one who checked out after one night and I felt like there should be some kind of fine. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=57.28s)]
*  He checked that after one night. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=65.48s)]
*  Yeah. One night he was like, I'm out. I'm tapping out. He really missed his family. So I think I'd be geared towards doing better. Cause I would have no one to miss, but I would get so upset about how skinny I would be coming out of it that I would never ever do it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=67.12s)]
*  Not that I would do well anyway, like I might have a decent fort, but when I was thinking about it, I was like, you did all this like build up and I've, I've done this. I've trained. I've been in the outback. I've, you know, they're in Tasmania. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=80.08s)]
*  So it's definitely challenging. And then he was done after one night. And then I thought, is that the best thing ever to get over? Like a fight with your wife is you sign up for a loan and then you say you've missed them so badly. You tap out after just one night. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=91.84s)]
*  It's probably the best relationship repair move possible. So maybe he's actually playing the game ahead of everybody else. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=104.4s)]
*  Cast away. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=109.48s)]
*  Wait, can I say one thing on a loan? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=110.72s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, of course. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=112.32s)]
*  You don't think the wife would be like, wait a second. What just happened? You spent four months training for this show. You quit the day. Are you just a quitter? What are our kids going to be like? Did you pass on your quitting DNA to our children? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=114.64s)]
*  I could, I mean like stay a second night. Like I understand the bugs. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=128.48s)]
*  Yeah, try to make it like four days. Some people know when they know they're just out. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=133.32s)]
*  But then you have to watch, you watch the people after like 24 hours going, what'd you think it was going to be? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=139.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  What'd you, what'd you, yeah, it's going to be really hard and there's not a grocery store. Like figure it out. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=144.72s)]
*  So, well, my dream in life was for my wife to be on survivor. Cause I think she just would have kept winning challenges, but she also goes crazy if she's not eating regularly. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  See, I can tell. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  So she would have been like, they would have been constantly trying to vote her off and then she just would have saved her ass again at the next challenge. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=162.16s)]
*  You know, I, I always have wanted to know somebody that I really know in my life who went on one of those shows and I'm still waiting. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=168.32s)]
*  Maybe it'll be you. Maybe you'll be on alone in Tasmania. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=176.4s)]
*  No, somebody that I'm actually like is in my life. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  Where I'm like, oh my God, this is going to be amazing. Brasilo's on alone. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=182.76s)]
*  I won't though. I won't because I'd be like 185 coming out of it and I'd never be the same. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=186.4s)]
*  You wouldn't just drink like a lot of coconut. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=191.56s)]
*  Like that. There's probably some nutrients you could do your cast away. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=193.79999999999998s)]
*  What was your cast away take? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=197.79999999999998s)]
*  I'd like the entire Island on fire within 24 hours. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=199.2s)]
*  I think that's the best chance of me being noticed. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=201.92s)]
*  I've thought about it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=203.95999999999998s)]
*  I think that's the only move I thought about that last night too. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=204.76s)]
*  Cause he goes to the top where he tests out whether he wants to hang himself on the top of the Island. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  And wouldn't the move be to just set everything as high as possible, the highest peak of the Island, set it on fire as much as you can. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  So you're getting at some point they've got to notice. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=220.76s)]
*  Although they did say it was a 500,000 square foot radius. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=223.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. I'm not saying it's going to work, but I just, I think in those first couple of days is your only chance of being noticed or say the first week or whatever. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=228.88s)]
*  So if you've got like a 10 day window. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=238.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=242.72s)]
*  I did this when I did the solo cast away pod during the first two months of COVID. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=243.12s)]
*  I did this, but I'm always amazed. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  The husband doesn't wake up. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=249.12s)]
*  That's my favorite part of the movie. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=250.2s)]
*  Cause Hanks he's back, Helen Hunt won't see him. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=252.35999999999999s)]
*  And then that first night he just says, fuck it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=255.67999999999998s)]
*  And takes a cab to her house. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=257.64s)]
*  Husband's just sleeping through it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=259.32s)]
*  I know it's raining, but that first night I'm probably going to be sleeping with one eye open. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=261.44s)]
*  Knowing my, knowing my wife is, is, is just in a tizzy that the love of her life actually survived. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=267.36s)]
*  I'm probably going to be up for a couple of days there. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=274.44s)]
*  Just making sure. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=276.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=277.92s)]
*  I can imagine if you were the new husband and if Helen Hunt were like, look, you know, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=278.32s)]
*  he's kind of my soulmate and I owe it to him. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=284.16s)]
*  And then just years later, you just, you just put in hours that irks just constantly drinking. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=287.2s)]
*  And guys would be like, he's, he's the guy he's the, and then he just kind of turns and goes, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=295.64s)]
*  what are you supposed to do? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=300.92s)]
*  You know, like bad, bad beat. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=301.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=304.56s)]
*  Maybe the move would have been to bow out. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=304.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=306.08s)]
*  See Denver. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=306.4s)]
*  So there's this, and I don't know if I just noticed that this year, but it might be every year where [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=309.47999999999996s)]
*  we have to, there's this new thing, the media does, and it's not new where they lecture people [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=316.24s)]
*  that we're not talking about somebody enough, or we got to give these guys more credit. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=320.4s)]
*  It's like this lecture thing. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=324.59999999999997s)]
*  It's a way of talking about a team because you don't really have anything that interesting to say. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=325.56s)]
*  So you look in the camera and you lecture people about, we're not talking about, okay, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=329.96s)]
*  so we're not talking about you. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=333.68s)]
*  I know we're doing people and you do that thing. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=334.64s)]
*  Um, we did this. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  I remember the first time I really noticed this was that the year after the sons made the finals [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=338.28s)]
*  when they were awesome, because I think I did it where the sons were really good that second year [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=342.64s)]
*  and nobody was talking about them. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=348.08s)]
*  And at some point there was a week where it was like, we're not talking about the sons. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=349.56s)]
*  What are we doing? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=353.28s)]
*  I did it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=354.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=355.24s)]
*  We did it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=355.52s)]
*  We all did it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=356.32s)]
*  I think we probably did it together. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  And then I think the Celtics did it last year. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=358.68s)]
*  I think this year, we did it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=361.36s)]
*  I think the Celtics hit that point where there was kind of not a lot to say. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=362.76000000000005s)]
*  They shot a lot of threes. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=366.16s)]
*  They hadn't won anything yet. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=367.28000000000003s)]
*  And I feel like, okay, see is in this zone this year. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=368.96000000000004s)]
*  I have some theories for this. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=371.96000000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=374.12s)]
*  Basically the subject heading would be why is it not that fun to talk about? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=374.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=378.68s)]
*  See yet. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=378.92s)]
*  Cause they just dusted Denver tonight and they have a guy who's going to win the MVP. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=379.48s)]
*  And yet everybody's like, ah, what is your opinion for why this is not fun yet? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=384.16s)]
*  Well, I don't know why it's not fun. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=390.20000000000005s)]
*  Cause I think there are a lot of fun to watch just their aggressiveness. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=391.68s)]
*  Or you look at the blocks that they had 14 blocks in today's game. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=394.59999999999997s)]
*  San Antonio leads the league with six blocks per game. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=397.59999999999997s)]
*  So like, there's just things that I've always noticed against Oklahoma city. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=400.12s)]
*  If you screw around, if you wait around, you're just going to be in trouble. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=403.15999999999997s)]
*  And now that they've rolled out this double big thing, they're doing with [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=406.47999999999996s)]
*  chat and experimenting with that. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=408.79999999999995s)]
*  And then they bring check back in like watching Phoenix play against [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=410.15999999999997s)]
*  Denver in comparison to watching Oakley seat. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=413.28s)]
*  Like it was, Hey, you want to sit up here? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=415.35999999999996s)]
*  Yokech. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=417.91999999999996s)]
*  Do you want to get a catch here? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=418.32s)]
*  Do you want to get a catch? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=419.84s)]
*  Do you want to be able to just turn and face the defense without any kind of [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=420.64s)]
*  pressure on you whatsoever and Yokech was great in the first quarter. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=423.88s)]
*  I don't know how much the elbow injury played into him missing, missing his [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=426.28s)]
*  free throws and type everything else, but there's just not a lot of room. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=428.8s)]
*  There's not a lot of time and you just cannot screw around against the thunder. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=432.0s)]
*  So I don't know why it wouldn't be fun. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=436.44s)]
*  Cause SGA SGA. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=439.15999999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=440.56s)]
*  Is he not as fun as ant? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=440.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=442.08s)]
*  Fine. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=442.59999999999997s)]
*  But I mean, this guy's on an absolute tear. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=443.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm about to have fun talking about SGA with you. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=445.84s)]
*  Just, just like three minutes from now, but I'm just flagging that for you now. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=448.72s)]
*  The final thing I would say is we kind of go through this is that I've always [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=452.64000000000004s)]
*  said, I just think we have a hard time with new, we have a really hard time [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=455.84000000000003s)]
*  with new, maybe even more so in the NBA. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=459.16s)]
*  Like when's the last time something was new, a team that hadn't won a [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=461.0s)]
*  championship players that hadn't won a championship where you thought, you [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=463.6s)]
*  know what, I'm all in on this team. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=466.72s)]
*  Cause for me, it's been a long time. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=468.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=470.08000000000004s)]
*  Even Boston last year who'd had the scars and had some tough losses and gotten [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=470.32s)]
*  in the finals and it was still the same thing. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=474.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, you know, we'll see. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=476.36s)]
*  We'll see if they can win four rounds. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=477.84s)]
*  Um, I think there's a couple issues with OKC. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=479.88s)]
*  None of them are their fault. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=482.56s)]
*  One is that they're new. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=483.64s)]
*  Two is that there's nothing polarizing about them whatsoever. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=485.15999999999997s)]
*  There's no argument. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=489.11999999999995s)]
*  There's no like, I'm going to sit in a sports bar and have an OKC argument [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=490.2s)]
*  about Jaylen Williams or Chet Holmgren. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=493.84s)]
*  Like they've just done everything correctly. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=495.79999999999995s)]
*  They've added talent really smartly. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=497.84s)]
*  They built a fun team. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=499.96s)]
*  I think they're eight, nine man rotation is pretty unassailably put together. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=501.47999999999996s)]
*  Um, they have all these picks coming and there's no zag and whenever there's not [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=507.2s)]
*  a zag, I think people have struggle. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=513.0s)]
*  They struggle to figure out like, well, how do we talk about this then? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=515.52s)]
*  Because you just end up going, this team's great. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=518.8s)]
*  This team's awesome. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=520.68s)]
*  But you watch them today and this team, I think that thing that is so impressive [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=521.72s)]
*  to me is that they can linger in these games and they'll be up like four, they'll [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=526.68s)]
*  be up three, they'll be up six, but then they'll just have this eight, oh, run out [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=530.96s)]
*  of nowhere and all of a sudden the game's 14, 15. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=534.64s)]
*  It's not even threes. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=536.64s)]
*  It's like defense. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=538.4s)]
*  Um, it's a second chance rebound. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=540.08s)]
*  It's SGA just scoring six points in a row. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=542.0s)]
*  I think they're really scary. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=544.9200000000001s)]
*  Um, do I think Denver could beat them in a series or the Lakers just by slowing [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=546.32s)]
*  things down by the pressure going up? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=551.24s)]
*  I wouldn't say no way, but OKC just has so many advantages. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=554.76s)]
*  You mentioned the two bigs thing today. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=559.6800000000001s)]
*  Their malleability now when they do that versus when they can go small. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=561.92s)]
*  Um, that's something they just didn't have last year, but the SGA piece of it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=565.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, I was, I was looking at, I was looking at all the best guard seasons. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=571.48s)]
*  He's having one of the best guard seasons, non-MJ in the history of the [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=575.6s)]
*  league, like when you're talking about team success, his, like his production, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=581.04s)]
*  his consistency, that was his, his, uh, 40th 30 point game today. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=587.0799999999999s)]
*  He had another 40 point game the way that he's played against other big teams. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=591.88s)]
*  How consistent he is night to night, how unstoppable he kind of is. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=595.76s)]
*  Um, I think that's probably the number one talking point with them now for me. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=599.8s)]
*  It's like, where, where does this SGA season rank against some of the other [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=605.24s)]
*  great guard seasons we've seen in our lifetime when you talk about Kobe and [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=608.9599999999999s)]
*  Harden and Curry and even somebody like Jordan statistically, he's moved into [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=612.68s)]
*  that stratosphere, which to me is the biggest surprise. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=617.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=622.64s)]
*  Because I think when you look at his three point shooting, even though he [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=622.76s)]
*  didn't hit any today, it didn't really matter. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=624.88s)]
*  Um, you know, that was maybe the final piece of him being this unstoppable [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=626.7199999999999s)]
*  score, but, you know, he's, you're right though, like whenever you think about [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=630.5999999999999s)]
*  the polarizing part of who we talk about, you know, whether it's the Lakers being [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=635.04s)]
*  at the top, you know, there's just going to be a lot of people that don't like [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=638.9599999999999s)]
*  the Lakers. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=640.96s)]
*  There's obviously going to be a lot of people don't like Boston. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=641.8000000000001s)]
*  Maybe Cleveland falls in this category a little bit, but maybe there's a little [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=643.88s)]
*  bit more hesitation on like what Mitchell is, even though what I would always defend [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=647.52s)]
*  with Mitchell is say what you want about some of the playoff exits. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=651.64s)]
*  Like, at least you know that his ceiling is these like legendary playoff [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=654.8000000000001s)]
*  performances where he can just go for like 45 and take over a game. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=659.12s)]
*  Uh, and he has zero fear with Boston. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=663.32s)]
*  Did you know he passed Jordan by the way, for most points per game against [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=665.36s)]
*  the Celtics in franchise history. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=668.24s)]
*  Seriously? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=669.56s)]
*  Seriously? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=670.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=671.64s)]
*  He's ahead of Jordan now. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=672.2399999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=674.04s)]
*  With that game, with that comeback. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=674.92s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=677.1199999999999s)]
*  Two Fridays ago. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=677.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=678.4s)]
*  So I think you're right. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=678.9599999999999s)]
*  Cause there's nothing to hate there. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=680.76s)]
*  They all, like if anything, people be like, they might be a little boring, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=682.0799999999999s)]
*  which, which is maybe part of the problem, which is, right. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=685.92s)]
*  I do not find them boring. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=689.8s)]
*  I mean, think about how deep this team is granted it's one game, but they shut [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=690.88s)]
*  everybody down right for this game. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=694.1199999999999s)]
*  I, and you know, I don't know if they did it strategically knowing they had Denver [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=696.52s)]
*  back to back here, maybe everybody was due. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=699.28s)]
*  They play, um, Jaylen Williams, the Arkansas Jaylen Williams, Usman [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=701.64s)]
*  Jang, Kenridge Williams, Isaiah Joe, Aaron Wiggins goes for 30. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=707.1999999999999s)]
*  All those guys played 30 minutes, you know, Brandon Carlson is playing 14. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=711.92s)]
*  Like, and they beat Portland by 20. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=715.72s)]
*  So this team is probably the worst. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=718.4399999999999s)]
*  If there was an expansion draft, Presti would be like, God damn it. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=720.9599999999999s)]
*  But I, I'm so impressed with them. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=724.16s)]
*  If you look at them night to night, you know, they, they seem to kind of figure [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=729.8399999999999s)]
*  out what you're trying to do, even the zone possessions that they did a good job [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=734.16s)]
*  against SGA, slowing him down a little bit, like eventually great players are going [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=736.9599999999999s)]
*  to kind of figure out your zone. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=740.1999999999999s)]
*  Denver has really no perimeter matchup for SGA on top of everything else. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=741.24s)]
*  Maybe the SGA free throw things upset people, but he's number one in drives. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=744.92s)]
*  He's averaging 21 drives per game, 15 points per game off those drives, which [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=748.3199999999999s)]
*  was three more than Zion, who has great drive numbers considering his minute totals. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=753.3199999999999s)]
*  And there's plenty of guys that hunt free throws that I can get frustrated [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=757.24s)]
*  with over the course of the game. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=761.64s)]
*  I don't even know that I find him as frustrating as some of the other people. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=762.64s)]
*  I just think he's that hard to defend because of the size. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=765.12s)]
*  So it really comes down to the number two guy. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=768.28s)]
*  Is there a number two guy that you trust enough in the playoffs for [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=770.68s)]
*  them to get through four rounds? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=773.2s)]
*  And I think there's still enough people out there that maybe doubt [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=774.4399999999999s)]
*  if Jalen Williams is that guy. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=777.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=779.0s)]
*  And they are in the same issue. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=779.28s)]
*  The Celtics are in with that top of the second quarter, top of the fourth [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=780.32s)]
*  quarter, can Jalen Williams run the offense for like four or five minutes, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=783.64s)]
*  which is the Jalen Brown issue with the Celtics sometimes the SGA piece of it. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=787.0400000000001s)]
*  Just cause I've been watching him really closely. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=791.6s)]
*  Cause I've been trying to think like, if the Celtics see him in the finals, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=793.48s)]
*  is there a way to defend this? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=797.36s)]
*  What is he doing exactly? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=798.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=800.08s)]
*  And he's got basically three different things that he vacillates between. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=801.12s)]
*  He has that thing. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=805.52s)]
*  You just go to the basket. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=807.0s)]
*  Like if you, if you fall asleep for a split second, he's got this first step [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=808.1600000000001s)]
*  and he can get to the rim and he can finish. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=811.36s)]
*  But then he also has the, I'm going to pretend I'm going to do the [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=813.4s)]
*  get to the rim thing and I just stop. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=815.9599999999999s)]
*  And there's no way your body momentum can stop with me. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=818.88s)]
*  And then I'm going to be elevating as you're still trying to catch up. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=821.8399999999999s)]
*  And I make a 15 footer, but then the third thing he does, and I don't know how [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=824.4s)]
*  he stopped it and he did it a couple of times in the fourth quarter today. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=828.16s)]
*  He has the ball like, you know, top of the three, three point line, top of the [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=832.4s)]
*  key and people are defending them and they're doing everything perfectly. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=836.1999999999999s)]
*  And it just seems like he's trying to decide what to do and whether he wants [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=839.88s)]
*  to swing the ball and then he'll just, he'll, he'll make like a subtle and [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=842.8s)]
*  all of a sudden he's shooting and every single time the team is a split second [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=847.4s)]
*  lay down, realizing he's about to take an 18 footer and I don't know how he does it. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=852.9599999999999s)]
*  I've never seen a guard get these shots that he wants without the defense [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=857.3599999999999s)]
*  realizing that that's the shot he was setting up for like Brunson will do. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=862.12s)]
*  Different versions of this, right? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=866.3199999999999s)]
*  He has his little spots on the court and he has that herky jerky style, but [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=867.68s)]
*  I always know he's going to shoot. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=871.12s)]
*  SGA shooting as I'm registering, oh, he's probably going to shoot here and he's [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=872.52s)]
*  already like releasing the ball and he's just so good at it now. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=875.9599999999999s)]
*  He's so good from 18 feet that the model I was thinking was solo was, uh, it's [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=879.48s)]
*  like the, like the most efficient version possible of, of where Colby was getting [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=885.4399999999999s)]
*  to in that Oh three to Oh nine range where just as, and Colby would try to swing [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=890.0s)]
*  between these three pointers, get into the line and then this like 15 to 18 foot [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=894.56s)]
*  range jump shot and it's just more efficient at it. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=898.52s)]
*  Like he's 53, 54% per game on some of these and they are, they're just always [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=901.48s)]
*  going in and I think about the Celtics. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=906.9200000000001s)]
*  It's like, how do you stop this? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=909.48s)]
*  What's your move? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=911.24s)]
*  Like, do you just say drew holiday on him all the time? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=912.04s)]
*  Well, then they're just going to get him in switches until he gets the guy that [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=914.24s)]
*  he wants on him and then he does it to them. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=917.76s)]
*  But it's, this is why he's going to win the MVP. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=919.96s)]
*  I think because when you watch them against these good teams, he always seems [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=922.8000000000001s)]
*  to get his points no matter what the other team is doing, and that's going [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=927.12s)]
*  to be the case for him ultimately. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=929.9200000000001s)]
*  Plus the wins. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=931.72s)]
*  I couldn't believe when it was what 89, 85. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=932.72s)]
*  I'm like, how is Denver still in this game? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=936.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=938.24s)]
*  Getting nothing from Yoke-age for two quarters. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=939.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=942.8000000000001s)]
*  And then Aaron Gordon who's out. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=943.08s)]
*  And if you look at the numbers for them, when Aaron Gordon's out, I think they're [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=944.44s)]
*  14 and 11 now, if you include today's game. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=947.04s)]
*  And I think they're 26 and 12 with them. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=949.76s)]
*  Those numbers can be off by a game here or there because sometimes it's, it's a [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=952.16s)]
*  little misleading to look it up. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=954.9200000000001s)]
*  But when you think about the switches, like they were attacking Yoke-age and, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=956.0s)]
*  you know, that's something you're still going to want to do. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=961.2s)]
*  And I always wonder if we would look at Yoke-age a little bit different [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=962.6800000000001s)]
*  defensively as if he were an issue for them, if they didn't have the title [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=965.08s)]
*  already, uh, I know I probably look at it and go, Hey, he's at least positioned [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=968.2800000000001s)]
*  right, but at least it's somebody you can think of attacking. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=972.36s)]
*  And then if it's not going to be beating Christian Brown off the dribble, which [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=974.96s)]
*  you can do without the screen, you can switch into Murray, you know, Westbrook's [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=977.6800000000001s)]
*  kind of hit or miss, you know, there's just a bunch of stuff that you can attack [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=981.36s)]
*  out there and a lot of it changes when Aaron Gordon is not in the game, not that [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=984.64s)]
*  Gordon would be defending them one-on-one like 30 feet away. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=987.52s)]
*  But I think the way you described his different ways of getting into his offense [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=990.5600000000001s)]
*  is, is the other part, the shot attempt is still available later for him with all [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=996.32s)]
*  the stuff that he does, then a lot of high volume scorers because he can kind [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1001.48s)]
*  of slow it all down. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1007.2s)]
*  It's, it's not like Luca, but it's almost the same thing where you [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1009.6s)]
*  don't really speed them up. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1012.5600000000001s)]
*  They play with this incredible pace and whatever's flying around them. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1013.72s)]
*  They're still completely in control of all of their options and at his size. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1018.12s)]
*  And then to be able to pull it from mid range, like even those zone possessions [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1022.84s)]
*  where it felt like Malone was slowing them down and clogging it up a little bit, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1025.72s)]
*  which I love when teams do like, Hey, something's not working. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1029.0s)]
*  Why don't you throw some zone out and make them think about it. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1031.6s)]
*  Now, some of these teams fall apart when they face a zone, but ultimately the [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1033.56s)]
*  more you keep doing it, especially with the team like the Thunder, where [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1036.84s)]
*  everybody's good with the ball in their hands, they should be able to figure it [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1039.8799999999999s)]
*  out. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1042.2s)]
*  So if you're talking Celtics part of it, they're clearly going to have better [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1042.44s)]
*  matchups against SGA and they're going to have a better rim protector. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1046.04s)]
*  If Presengus is playing, if you have four different perimeter guys that you can [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1050.96s)]
*  throw at them, that's great. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1055.52s)]
*  It seems size. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1056.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1058.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1058.44s)]
*  And size too, on top of everything else, because Denver doesn't really have any [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1058.76s)]
*  perimeter size other than Porter Jr. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1062.04s)]
*  Again, Porter Jr. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1065.0s)]
*  and Gordon against him. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1065.88s)]
*  That's probably guys that are too big. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1066.84s)]
*  So it's really coming off of the corners. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1068.48s)]
*  And I think part, I don't, I don't like the assumptions. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1071.2s)]
*  What if OKC doesn't hit those open corner threes as everybody helps off of the [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1074.12s)]
*  corners to go to SGA? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1078.1599999999999s)]
*  You're like, all right, well, welcome to the league. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1079.6s)]
*  But at least they have like Wallace hit one. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1082.12s)]
*  I think he was one for four. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1085.08s)]
*  Dort hit a couple. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1086.12s)]
*  Caruso had one late. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1087.08s)]
*  I like OKC's chances. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1088.96s)]
*  If those are the corner guys, Isaiah, Joe throw him in there. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1090.76s)]
*  That's the way the team is built. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1094.4399999999998s)]
*  So yeah, there's not somebody else necessarily at like SGA's level as a two [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1095.9199999999998s)]
*  guard or a two option, I should say. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1099.3999999999999s)]
*  And no one really has like another MVP waiting like that. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1101.68s)]
*  So it's not really a fair criticism of OKC, but I've heard that talk about, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1105.0800000000002s)]
*  I was like, what happens with those secondary shooters in a tight playoff [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1108.5600000000002s)]
*  game? And I'm just like, well, that's, that's kind of the league. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1112.88s)]
*  So I don't know why it's specific to them. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1116.0800000000002s)]
*  I mentioned the three different ways that seems like he scores. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1119.24s)]
*  I should have mentioned the fourth way too, which is this team's just a really [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1121.76s)]
*  good transition team. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1124.96s)]
*  They, you know, long rebounds or if they get a steal, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1127.0800000000002s)]
*  they just finish plays and SJ is really good in the open four or two, which I [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1131.56s)]
*  think that's probably the fourth way is getting his points. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1135.3999999999999s)]
*  He's up to something else to add though about this team. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1137.32s)]
*  Yeah, your Kobe thing with SGA. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1140.32s)]
*  SGA is totally fine getting rid of the ball. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1142.48s)]
*  Right. So that's another part of it where, you know, if he's out there and he's [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1145.48s)]
*  going like, I still may be alive in this possession. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1149.32s)]
*  I do think some teams get used to their number one scoring option once they're [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1152.32s)]
*  past a certain moment of just being OK, now I'm not really in the play. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1156.24s)]
*  I'm not going to cut. I'm not going to relocate perimeter. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1159.52s)]
*  These these guys feel really, really connected, maybe because they all came up [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1162.84s)]
*  together and because they're young and last year felt like, wow, they're already [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1166.16s)]
*  this good. I think there's I think there's a personality to this team that also, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1170.12s)]
*  you know, makes me like them. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1174.76s)]
*  That's another piece that makes it not that fun to quote unquote talk about them [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1176.36s)]
*  because they all like each other and get along. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1180.92s)]
*  They do interviews after the game. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1183.08s)]
*  There's no like, I wonder, is Jaylen Williams jealous about SGA? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1184.32s)]
*  There's none of that shit. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1189.6s)]
*  So SGA is 33 a game, 53% field goal plus 17.6 net rating heading into this game. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1190.8799999999999s)]
*  Although a lot of the OKC guys are way up 31.1 PR, which is really rare for a [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1198.8799999999999s)]
*  guard that's top 20 all time. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1203.16s)]
*  Um, and he plays every game, which I'm always going to say this over and over [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1205.6s)]
*  again, durability should matter a little more when we talk about all this stuff. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1209.92s)]
*  Um, but if you compare it to curry in 2016, when the Warriors went 73 and nine, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1213.2s)]
*  30 points a game, 35 and seven basically. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1220.28s)]
*  And he had all the 50, 45, 90 percentage stuff. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1223.56s)]
*  MJ and 92 when the Bulls went 67 and 15, he was 36 and six, 52% played 80 games. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1227.08s)]
*  Um, Kobe probably his best season was Oh three for team success combined with the [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1237.28s)]
*  stats, um, 37 and six, and then hardened in 2018 when they went 65 and 17, he was [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1243.44s)]
*  30, six and nine. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1252.76s)]
*  So as crazy as this sounds, he's having the best statistical season of any of [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1255.5600000000002s)]
*  these guards combined with like, did you win in the mid sixties or higher? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1260.52s)]
*  So if you're talking about, cause I've heard some people be like joke, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1265.4s)]
*  Yokech has to be the MVP again. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1267.96s)]
*  I just think SGA say, I don't know who I'm voting for yet. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1270.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm taking it to the last week as always, but, uh, watching SGA do this over and [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1272.64s)]
*  over again in these big games, just get to his 40 points. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1277.3600000000001s)]
*  His team is usually winning. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1281.1200000000001s)]
*  He's doing it day after day after day. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1283.0s)]
*  He has a dramatic effect on everybody. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1285.2s)]
*  Um, I just think he's checking all the boxes. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1287.92s)]
*  It would be, it would be hard for me to believe he's not going to win [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1290.96s)]
*  if they win 66 games. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1293.48s)]
*  This helps, you know, national broadcast, head to head. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1296.8400000000001s)]
*  Yokech has the great first quarter is not enough of a factor. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1300.2s)]
*  SGA closes it out. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1304.0800000000002s)]
*  I imagine more people are probably paying attention to today's slated games [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1306.3600000000001s)]
*  than maybe a late Friday overtime win against Phoenix where he goes 30, 20 and [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1309.32s)]
*  20 and at Yokech is seventh, 15, 15, 15 game this season, which is the most, I [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1313.28s)]
*  think since Oscar Robertson. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1319.68s)]
*  So, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1321.52s)]
*  I mean, you see this stat. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1322.52s)]
*  He had a triple double on Friday night in the beginning of the third quarter. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1323.44s)]
*  And then a second triple double during the game on Friday, he put together two [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1326.6799999999998s)]
*  different triple doubles in one game. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1332.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1335.6799999999998s)]
*  I, the momentum part for SGA with voters, my guess would be SGA is going to win it [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1335.8799999999999s)]
*  because of how good the team is because of a head to head. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1341.6s)]
*  Look, they go back at it again tomorrow night. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1344.56s)]
*  Um, right. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1347.0s)]
*  I've never be awesome tomorrow night. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1348.08s)]
*  I've never once thought SGA was better than Yokech. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1350.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1353.7199999999998s)]
*  I still think Yokech is the best player in the league. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1354.04s)]
*  So if it's close at the end of the year, I'm going to remember that if I still [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1356.44s)]
*  have a vote, uh, we can get into some of the advanced stuff and depending on the [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1360.72s)]
*  day you sort it, it's SGA or Yokech. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1364.04s)]
*  Um, and it's, it's really, really close with all that stuff. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1366.6s)]
*  I think there's always a part of it too, of like, if you took more shots, would [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1369.84s)]
*  we be more enamored with his scoring output, but it's just not the way he's [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1373.8799999999999s)]
*  going to play. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1377.68s)]
*  I also think, okay, so he's just a better basketball team. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1378.2s)]
*  Um, so yeah, I'm still leaning Yokech and I, I want to remind myself of that. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1381.2s)]
*  If it's close, who do you think is the best player? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1385.28s)]
*  I don't, I don't know that, you know, even with this season, well, SGA is done. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1388.76s)]
*  I'll ever actually think that he's better than Yokech and that will factor into my [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1393.32s)]
*  voting. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1395.96s)]
*  Um, and I wonder if Yokech like depending on seating and all that kind of stuff [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1396.8799999999999s)]
*  with the West will kind of matter. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1400.48s)]
*  You think for Denver with their home quarter, it should kind of matter, but I [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1401.84s)]
*  think Yokech cost himself one in the MB the MB MVP season because towards the end [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1405.28s)]
*  of it, yeah, it just seemed like he didn't care about it as much. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1411.04s)]
*  So I wonder if that's [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1413.8799999999999s)]
*  minus as J's minus 600. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1414.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm not deciding until the last week, but everything, everything as J is doing, I [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1417.8799999999999s)]
*  find it hard to believe he's not going to win with the team record and everything [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1423.6399999999999s)]
*  else, but I'm with you. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1427.24s)]
*  They, if I'm just starting from scratch and who is the best part in the league, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1429.44s)]
*  it's really hard for me to think it's not game to game, all the stuff Yokech does. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1434.48s)]
*  And I think he's been in a harder spot this year with his team, not knowing where [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1438.56s)]
*  you're getting from Murray the first two months. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1442.0s)]
*  Gordon's been up and down the last like six weeks with injuries. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1444.24s)]
*  Westbrook they're relying on in this insane way. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1448.72s)]
*  Now, um, they don't have a bench at all. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1451.48s)]
*  As she is, has at least, if you're going to like, and it's not his fault, but he [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1454.72s)]
*  at least knows when he leaves the game, they're not going to immediately crater. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1458.52s)]
*  Um, but it's a good, bad, it's a really good battle. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1462.28s)]
*  I hope it doesn't get, uh, I hope it doesn't get cantankerous closer. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1465.48s)]
*  I'm sure it will. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1470.6s)]
*  You know, I even saying some of the stuff I've said already, but if somebody says [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1471.48s)]
*  like, you need to explain that to me, I was just going to know. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1475.04s)]
*  I don't. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1479.1200000000001s)]
*  You need to explain Yokech. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1481.44s)]
*  Also, it's good to talk to, like, if you talk to people who actually. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1483.1200000000001s)]
*  Coach in the league or run teams, Yokech is still the bar for the teams. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1487.24s)]
*  It's a little like Mahomes. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1491.92s)]
*  Mahomes wasn't the best player in the league last year in the NFL, but he was [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1493.04s)]
*  still the bar that people pointed to. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1496.44s)]
*  And they thought like, who do we have to get by to actually win the title? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1498.32s)]
*  You looked at him, you looked at Mahomes first. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1501.52s)]
*  I think you look at Yokech first. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1503.36s)]
*  It'd be one thing too, of like, Yokech was having a down season at SGA. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1505.2s)]
*  There's just a huge gap between the stats. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1508.3999999999999s)]
*  And then you kind of start leaning towards, okay, well, this guy's had such [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1510.36s)]
*  a better season that I can't actually, cause I think there's some Curry stuff [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1513.32s)]
*  with LeBron where I don't know that anybody thought Curry was actually better [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1518.24s)]
*  than LeBron, he was just having those seasons and part of the story, uh, which [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1521.12s)]
*  I think is always a huge part with voters. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1526.04s)]
*  Cause voters like stories is that when it's new and it's kind of this, this [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1527.84s)]
*  next level of accomplishment, at least for the regular season, cause that's [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1533.36s)]
*  what the award is, uh, that player is going to have a ton of momentum. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1537.56s)]
*  So I'm with you. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1540.24s)]
*  I'd be surprised if SGA doesn't win it. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1540.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1543.52s)]
*  Well, if OKC wins tomorrow and they win the back to back against Ember, it's [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1544.36s)]
*  probably going to be a wrap at this point. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1549.08s)]
*  All right. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1550.72s)]
*  We're going to take a quick break and then let's talk about lessons [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1551.04s)]
*  from Lakers Boston last night. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1554.76s)]
*  One of the best parts of the tournament is when an underdog takes down a powerhouse. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1556.52s)]
*  This was in my formative years with March Madness in the eighties. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1563.3600000000001s)]
*  It was always the most fun when this happened right now, those [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1566.4s)]
*  upsets can get even better this week on Fandual. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1568.64s)]

*  Okay. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1660.04s)]
*  See that Philly pick is such a monkey wrench in this draft. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1660.28s)]
*  If that ends up being seven, eight or nine. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1664.48s)]
*  I just, I kept thinking about it, watching that game like, what [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1666.32s)]
*  does this team even need? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1668.96s)]
*  What are they? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1671.0s)]

*  We got to upgrade. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1673.76s)]

*  I kind of like, so anyway, all right. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1676.52s)]
*  Lakers Celtics felt like a massive basketball game last night. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1678.1599999999999s)]
*  It felt like real theater and the Lakers were a little compromised. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1682.56s)]
*  No Rui and no even Jackson Hayes. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1685.8799999999999s)]
*  I can't believe I'm saying it, but not having both of those guys. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1688.24s)]
*  Having no centers. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1691.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1692.36s)]
*  Having no centers an issue against a team that has size and can drive the [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1692.48s)]
*  basket, Seltzer and FKP. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1695.8s)]
*  Um, but that game was really fun to watch. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1698.24s)]
*  Tatum was awesome. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1703.8799999999999s)]
*  Um, the crowd was really interesting about, I knew multiple people that were [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1705.84s)]
*  there and there were some Laker fans there. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1709.9199999999998s)]
*  I think there was some secondary market Laker fans. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1711.52s)]
*  So there was a real energy in the arena and the Lakers just couldn't keep up. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1713.6s)]
*  It was unsustainable with, uh, those two guys in the LeBron breaks down anyway. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1717.72s)]
*  But what, what big lesson did you take from that game? [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1721.68s)]
*  Anything? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1724.0s)]
*  Horford. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1724.6799999999998s)]
*  It's just incredible that this guy is doing what he's doing, uh, at this age. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1727.08s)]
*  Now you start thinking, okay, how much more does he have? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1734.7199999999998s)]
*  And that was probably a couple of years ago. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1737.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1739.4799999999998s)]
*  And you're thinking out, you know, remember that year he was lightened up from [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1739.6799999999998s)]
*  three from the regular season, which he's done a couple of times and then [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1742.8s)]
*  in the playoffs, it was just kind of over. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1745.3999999999999s)]
*  I think it's just really fitting to considering he was such a huge free agent [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1747.32s)]
*  signing, and then I think a lot of fans were like, I thought this guy was [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1750.1599999999999s)]
*  like a max player and how come he's not like doing more of these things? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1752.52s)]
*  And you're just going, well, there's, there's just more to it than just the [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1755.12s)]
*  scoring for Horford's being positioned the right way it's it's, it's a guy you [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1757.44s)]
*  want on your basketball team. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1761.4s)]
*  And then he goes to Philly, he gets flipped. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1762.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1765.24s)]
*  See speaking to that pick, it's basically sat down because okay. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1765.56s)]
*  See is rebuilding and then he comes back to Boston and he's a huge, huge, the [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1769.72s)]
*  luxury of having an Al Horford to step in when Przingus isn't available is incredible. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1773.76s)]
*  And it was very clear that Boston had their hunting strategy. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1780.32s)]
*  Cause we talked about it like that hunt happy approach to basketball that look [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1785.24s)]
*  as a big part of everything that you're watching every night, but the Lakers. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1789.4s)]
*  Like let's kill Al Horford tonight. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1793.8400000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1796.04s)]
*  So I don't know if you saw the numbers afterwards, the tracking bond temps had [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1796.48s)]
*  it on ESPN.com they targeted Horford 23 times last night. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1800.0s)]
*  That's my guys. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1805.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1806.6000000000001s)]
*  According to the second spectrum, the second most isolations against any [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1806.8s)]
*  player in a single game since the player tracking started in 2013, 2014, he [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1810.48s)]
*  allowed 0.39 points per direct play. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1816.08s)]
*  The second best efficiency by any player to defend at least 15 isolations in a [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1819.8799999999999s)]
*  game, the last 12 seasons, the Lakers deciding what we like here is attacking [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1823.48s)]
*  Al and watching Al spread out one-on-one 25 feet away from the basket, getting [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1829.52s)]
*  down into a stance and fighting through every one of these hunting switches. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1835.76s)]
*  Like I lost track of other stuff that was happening in the game because I was [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1840.6s)]
*  having, you know, you never noticed like something in a game and you go, Hey, I [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1844.36s)]
*  got to start watching the game. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1846.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1848.04s)]
*  You've you're focused. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1848.28s)]
*  I couldn't stop watching him and just like out. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1849.44s)]
*  I couldn't, I was so impressed with him that he held up that way. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1853.16s)]
*  And then I thought, okay, are they going to get like, are they just wearing him [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1858.08s)]
*  out to the point where this is going to become a real problem later on? [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1860.44s)]
*  And look, they got the huge lead Lakers make a big comeback there, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1863.56s)]
*  but Horford was a story. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1866.8s)]
*  He's really comfortable at least banging with LeBron, which is funny because [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1870.16s)]
*  there was that whole stretch when LeBron just owned the Hawks and, um, and they've, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1874.8s)]
*  even though his minutes are the same this year, it doesn't feel like they've used [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1879.1200000000001s)]
*  them in the same way as they've been way more bubble wrapy with him. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1883.0800000000002s)]
*  And then if they really need him, they'll unleash him in a game like that. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1886.0s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1888.68s)]
*  He was, uh, he's awesome. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1889.2s)]
*  I don't understand how he's still doing it. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1891.04s)]
*  I was surprised the Lakers didn't try to get Reeves going a little bit more. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1893.0s)]
*  Cause I think that's somebody that Celtics have had trouble, um, matching up with [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1896.84s)]
*  just those kind of herky jerky guards in general seem to do okay against them. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1901.72s)]
*  But I thought the Lakers just got too trapped into this idea of what they [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1907.12s)]
*  thought they, they, uh, wanted to do. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1910.68s)]
*  It was also a really weird Luka game who clearly wasn't a hundred percent. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1912.84s)]
*  My dad was tech, my dad went to the game. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1915.72s)]
*  He was texting me and he was just like, what's wrong with Luka? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1917.24s)]
*  Like I started getting those texts pretty early. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1919.92s)]
*  Like something's not right. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1922.08s)]
*  He doesn't seem right. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1923.28s)]
*  Um, and just, he just seemed off and then LeBron got hurt, which, you know, um, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1924.8s)]
*  he, he tweaked the groin. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1931.6399999999999s)]
*  We'll see how long he's out, but this is the problem and you're overcompensating [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1932.9199999999998s)]
*  for these other things that are missing and you can fly around and you can look [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1937.36s)]
*  really good in a Thursday night game, but it's not sustainable. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1941.4399999999998s)]
*  You can't, can't put that kind of rebound and defense pressure on LeBron. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1944.08s)]
*  So, you know, he might, they might drop out, drop down now to like the four or [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1948.6s)]
*  five seed, we might get Lakers Warriors round one is, is not inconceivable at [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1952.24s)]
*  this point, which I think would, uh, would be just a nuts series. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1958.1599999999999s)]
*  One thing I noticed before LeBron got hurt. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1962.8799999999999s)]
*  I like, this is the most fun I think I've had watching him since that, since [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1966.84s)]
*  the COVID season, um, just some of the decisions, some of the ways he was [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1971.52s)]
*  attacking the Celtics, how comfortable athletically he was, it was actually [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1976.76s)]
*  looking a little 2018 LeBron ish to me, that whole run he had in the Cavs team, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1980.36s)]
*  but he has obviously better teammates. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1985.52s)]
*  I, uh, I still would not want to see this team in the series, even if they don't [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1988.52s)]
*  have a center, I assume they're going to have at least Ruby and Hayes when they [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1992.56s)]
*  get to a series, but, um, how fast that they can make up these little eight point [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=1996.36s)]
*  whatever's, um, I just, uh, I'm just still taking them seriously. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2000.84s)]
*  Last night didn't change anything for me. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2006.72s)]
*  And then from a Celtic standpoint, I thought Bob Ryan had a great tweet about it. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2008.36s)]
*  He said, this Celtics team is like a gifted child with a concentration [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2013.24s)]
*  problem as Bob Ryan's take on last night's game, uh, cause how many times [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2018.2s)]
*  have they been up 22, 23, and they just fuck around for six minutes and the [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2023.48s)]
*  lead seven and the crowds groaning and we're like, come on guys, let's [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2028.24s)]
*  finish the game here. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2032.04s)]
*  They do it over and over again. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2033.36s)]
*  And last night was another example. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2034.8s)]
*  So those are all my takeaways. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2036.96s)]
*  I think leading into this to be fair, the Lakers have that overtime win against [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2039.8s)]
*  the Knicks, which was an awesome game on Thursday. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2044.1200000000001s)]
*  They had been home since the last week of February. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2046.68s)]
*  So they started a home stand. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2050.88s)]
*  I think they would have been home from Denver, probably the 23rd of February, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2052.84s)]
*  if they didn't come back. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2056.72s)]
*  So it's their first time they're on the road. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2057.56s)]
*  That game's March 8th, Boston sat a bunch of guys against Philly. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2059.7999999999997s)]
*  Like Boston should have been up for that game, should have been better rested. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2064.0s)]
*  And when the line came out, it was like five and a half. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2068.2s)]
*  I remember thinking like, I don't know, this might, this might be a spot. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2070.68s)]
*  I guess the Lakers part of it has been really hard for me because I can't believe [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2073.0s)]
*  they're this good defensively and they've won all of these games. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2077.44s)]
*  And the one thing that you thought when they added Luca, you go, okay, well, how's [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2081.36s)]
*  that perimeter going to hold up defensively? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2085.12s)]
*  And then LeBron cranks it back up after having stretches this season where it [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2086.96s)]
*  looked like he was a liability defensively. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2090.44s)]
*  But you'd imagine you got to give him the benefit of the doubt in a playoff series. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2092.12s)]
*  But I'm with you. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2095.36s)]
*  Like I went to, as we talked about last week, a bunch of Lakers games in a [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2096.08s)]
*  pretty quick amount of time. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2100.92s)]
*  Like I just, I know you're like the new Diane Cannon. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2102.12s)]
*  I know. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2104.68s)]
*  It's you, Diane Cannon and Lou Adler. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2105.44s)]
*  Just go to Laker games. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2107.32s)]
*  One day, one day Bill, but watching LeBron shot making, like, this is not [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2108.68s)]
*  why you're listening to the pod. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2114.24s)]
*  Like here's the low say that LeBron's good at basketball, but the shot making [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2115.3199999999997s)]
*  in the angle stuff and these fadeaways that he's incorporated where you expect [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2119.52s)]
*  it to go in every single time. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2123.9599999999996s)]
*  Like, I can't believe how often he's making these shots, the takeoff and the [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2125.72s)]
*  starting point of it, like that's, that's going to go in. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2130.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2133.72s)]
*  And so, you know, whether we're talking all NBA stuff, and then you look at like [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2133.9599999999996s)]
*  the points per possession and what he's done and his life should be easier. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2138.56s)]
*  His life should be easier now with Luca, where I think, you know, there's a [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2143.48s)]
*  version of it going back to peak Miami LeBron, where you just never wanted the [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2146.84s)]
*  ball out of his hands, even though, you know, Wade is an incredible player and [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2152.2400000000002s)]
*  what he would offer in here. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2156.36s)]
*  I think the Luca part of it makes his life a little bit easier. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2157.6s)]
*  So I don't, I don't put a ton of stock into last night's game because I think [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2161.32s)]
*  the way it was set up, like you would expect Boston was going to win that one. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2165.16s)]
*  Well, so they dialed up the minutes. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2168.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, they, they went for it. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2170.36s)]
*  Like Tatum didn't, Tatum didn't come out for the first like 19 minutes of the game. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2171.64s)]
*  He played 45 all the way through. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2175.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2177.7599999999998s)]
*  He went all the way through. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2178.08s)]
*  They took him out for like a minute in the second quarter. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2179.08s)]
*  I was like, Jesus, I think they really wanted it. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2181.28s)]
*  Cause the Lakers kicked their ass. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2183.88s)]
*  It was interesting though, my dad after the game, cause I FaceTimed them this [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2186.0s)]
*  morning and we were breaking it down. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2189.2s)]
*  And he was like, I thought they were scary with Davis. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2191.2s)]
*  That way, which I thought was a great zag by him. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2196.48s)]
*  I don't know if he's eligible now to come on first take and just like [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2199.12s)]
*  zag hard against Perk and SAS. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2201.92s)]
*  But, um, but he was just like, I, he was like, I thought that team was really hard [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2203.96s)]
*  for us to play because how big and how physical they were and now it's like. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2208.52s)]
*  You know, he, and he's made the same point that I was thinking of watching the [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2212.04s)]
*  game and the announcers talked about too. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2215.3599999999997s)]
*  Like Jaylen loves playing against Luca for some reason. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2217.08s)]
*  I don't know what it is, but Luca brings out the best out of Jaylen and Jaylen [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2219.88s)]
*  really feels like he goes into these Luca games, like we're at least going to be [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2224.96s)]
*  a draw in these games and the rest of my team is better. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2228.04s)]
*  So, uh, yeah, I still feel like when it comes down to the playoffs and those two [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2231.72s)]
*  guys trying to figure out at least one of them's out there all the time, all the [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2237.7599999999998s)]
*  shit we've talked about forever. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2241.8s)]
*  I actually think we can't talk about this Lakers team enough. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2243.2s)]
*  This is such a fascinating situation to have this one guy who's one of the [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2245.8s)]
*  greatest players of all time, who's playing as well as he's played in five years. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2249.44s)]
*  And then this other guy who had a chance to be the future of the league, who's on [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2253.52s)]
*  his team, I've, I think I've watched every quarter of the Lakers since they, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2256.44s)]
*  since these two guys have been playing together. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2260.88s)]
*  Like I can't get enough of it. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2263.12s)]
*  I was, uh, I was going to ask you this about the Boston part of it. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2266.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2269.44s)]
*  So the Bob Ryan thing is really funny, right? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2270.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2273.68s)]
*  It's really funny. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2273.84s)]
*  And clearly you watch him a ton. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2274.64s)]
*  I watched them a lot and I started to have the same feelings again, where it's [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2277.68s)]
*  like, why are you guys waiting so late to go into your offense? [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2282.2400000000002s)]
*  Now it's shut down. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2285.96s)]
*  Now it's Jaylen Brown pulling up from this 15, 17 foot. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2287.4s)]
*  Like these are, these are tough shots. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2290.96s)]
*  And honestly, it feels like Jaylen makes more of them than I expected. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2292.6s)]
*  He was really good last night for most of the game. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2295.68s)]
*  But there's just a lot of those shots. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2297.8399999999997s)]
*  You're like, that's, that's what you guys are going to settle with. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2299.2s)]
*  You know, four people watching. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2302.96s)]
*  And I think I did it when I did my horrible 15 teams in 15 minutes. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2304.44s)]
*  It took 40 minutes. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2308.12s)]
*  Cause the whole gag is that it's supposed to be 30 teams in 30 minutes. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2309.72s)]
*  And I tried really hard to keep it to 30 minutes. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2312.48s)]
*  And I think I did an hour. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2314.64s)]
*  So I'll try to, I'll try to fix that next year. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2316.0s)]
*  But every time you start going through this boss, this stuff, you're like, okay, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2318.7999999999997s)]
*  well, let me look at the offense. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2321.48s)]
*  All right. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2322.52s)]
*  Top five offense. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2322.7599999999998s)]
*  Let me look up the clutch offense. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2323.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2324.7999999999997s)]
*  It's third in the NBA behind Cleveland and Denver. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2325.04s)]
*  So do you think you watch the Celtics too much and you take it more personally [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2328.12s)]
*  when they get bogged down into bad offensive sets, when they have a lead, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2332.72s)]
*  or it seems like they're settling, they take too late to get into stuff. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2336.16s)]
*  Maybe get a little hunt happy when there's really no number that tells you [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2339.04s)]
*  it's that much of a flaw. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2342.24s)]
*  It's a, I've watched too much of this team thing when they're up 23. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2344.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't feel safe at all. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2348.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm just waiting for stupid shit to happen. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2350.84s)]
*  And that's, that's the biggest criticism I can have against them. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2354.1200000000003s)]
*  They're up 91 69. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2357.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm like, all right, there's going to be a run here. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2358.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm just going to just hopefully, hopefully Joe Maz will call, sniff it out, call [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2361.6400000000003s)]
*  timeout before it gets too bad. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2365.6000000000004s)]
*  And then it happens. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2367.6800000000003s)]
*  You look at the net rating. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2369.52s)]
*  So the last 20 games, they're still fourth. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2370.68s)]
*  They're 15 and five in their last 20. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2374.16s)]
*  They're plus 7.8. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2376.04s)]
*  They haven't been like as kick-ass as I think they were in this stretch last year. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2378.2s)]
*  And if you look at the top six teams who I think are Cleveland, okay. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2384.08s)]
*  See in Boston drop off Denver Lakers, golden state as the teams that have a [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2389.2s)]
*  chance to win the title Minnesota, I think has to be considered maybe as like [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2393.9199999999996s)]
*  a wild, wild, wild card. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2398.08s)]
*  Who the fuck knows? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2399.44s)]
*  And then Detroit has just been awesome with advanced metrics for like 25, 30 [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2401.3599999999997s)]
*  games and that's been our top eight. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2406.08s)]
*  Um, I, I just would have thought that Celtics would be doing a little bit better. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2408.12s)]
*  That's if you're going to talk about like as Celtic fan, what am I concerned about? [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2413.2s)]
*  They're not dominating like they did last year in some of these games. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2417.6s)]
*  Whereas okay. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2421.7999999999997s)]
*  See, it feels like okay. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2422.48s)]
*  See is usually going to be up 20, 25 against a shitty team. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2425.3999999999996s)]
*  And the South that's like, well, maybe they will now they've been resting dudes. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2430.7599999999998s)]
*  Like they had that Portland game the other night where they're just like, Hey, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2434.04s)]
*  Pritchard and white, just shoot, shoot the lights out. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2436.52s)]
*  They had another game where it's basically just Tate them and a bunch of G leaguers. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2438.7999999999997s)]
*  So they've been using the schedule and that's that is some of the net rating [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2441.96s)]
*  stuff, but, um, I'd like to see them go on one little streak here before the, uh, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2445.64s)]
*  playoffs a little like what Cleveland's doing right now. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2450.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2454.3599999999997s)]
*  Do you think it's stretch? [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2454.56s)]
*  Do you think it has anything to do with Prisingas in and out? [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2456.24s)]
*  Though, or you like get into a flow. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2460.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2463.4s)]
*  No, you're right. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2464.48s)]
*  It might. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2465.16s)]
*  Um, let's talk all NBA. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2467.48s)]
*  We're gonna bring in Brian Curtis in a couple of minutes. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2470.4s)]
*  Let's talk on the really quick. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2472.2799999999997s)]
*  I can't remember with 20 games left, the first team already being done. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2474.3199999999997s)]
*  Cause it's going to be yolkage, Tatum, Yanis, SGA and Mitchell. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2478.4s)]
*  Um, especially with eight, there might've been some sort of LeBron push with how [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2482.64s)]
*  good he's been the last like six, seven weeks, but now if he's going to miss some [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2487.12s)]
*  time, that's probably out. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2490.4s)]
*  Uh, I don't see there if there's any way, I don't see any of those guys losing [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2492.08s)]
*  their spot. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2496.32s)]
*  I think that's a rep. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2497.12s)]
*  Um, but then we get to the second and third teams and I think it's going to be [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2498.7200000000003s)]
*  a free for all where, you know, if you only want to take two guards for the [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2502.8s)]
*  second team, it's Edwards and Brunson and Cade, you have to pick two, or you can [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2507.44s)]
*  tweak it and cheat and just put all three of them on there. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2512.32s)]
*  I think LeBron is clearly second team all NBA at this point with the way he's [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2515.6s)]
*  played the last two months. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2519.52s)]
*  And then center is between towns and triple J. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2521.44s)]
*  If you want to do a center for the hell of it. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2524.28s)]
*  I also feel like Mobly and Jalen Williams have to be on there just because of how [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2527.72s)]
*  well their teams are. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2531.6s)]
*  I think both of those teams should have two all NBAs. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2532.52s)]
*  And then after that, you could talk to, you know, 15 guys, but is there anything [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2535.24s)]
*  as you kind of look, cause we're going to do this every week. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2539.08s)]
*  We'll call it all NBA watch. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2540.92s)]
*  Is there any sort of storyline you're looking at to see? [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2542.64s)]
*  Could this guy pass this guy? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2546.24s)]
*  Could this guy lose his spot? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2548.2000000000003s)]
*  Cause for me, Katie's not an all NBA guy if they're going to be an under 500 team. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2549.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2554.96s)]
*  I wrote down Katie. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2555.12s)]
*  There's so many names that I had to write down where I think we've had other years [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2555.84s)]
*  where you're like, I think it's like 17 for 15, and then there's the line and you [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2559.7200000000003s)]
*  knew, um, the LeBron push would have been interesting if you wanted to put Tatum [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2563.04s)]
*  at guard. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2569.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2571.36s)]
*  Now, would you, would you have agreed with that? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2572.6s)]
*  So LeBron versus Mitchell for first team spot, basically. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2574.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2578.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2580.0800000000004s)]
*  That's really tough for me. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2580.36s)]
*  Cause Cleveland Mitchell's so important. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2581.44s)]
*  What Cleveland does. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2583.28s)]
*  I really feel like wind should matter at least a little on this. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2584.1600000000003s)]
*  I feel like his stats would be better if the team wasn't as good as it is. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2586.6800000000003s)]
*  There's some games where he plays like 28 minutes. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2590.76s)]
*  It's not his fault. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2592.6000000000004s)]
*  They're beating teams by 25. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2593.5600000000004s)]
*  Now it's kind of taken care of itself because the growing injury, especially [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2596.32s)]
*  being older already with a one to two week thing, like you hope this doesn't [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2599.36s)]
*  linger that it changes. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2603.4s)]
*  Cause I really want to see what LA can do. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2604.96s)]
*  Like I'm excited about them now being raised to a level of actually having [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2606.92s)]
*  expectations where I don't really think I had that many expectations for him a [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2611.48s)]
*  couple of months ago, but you could, if you wanted to do that, cause Tatum [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2615.2000000000003s)]
*  basically plays point card. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2619.4s)]
*  Um, so I don't think it'd be that much of a stretch, even though he's not going [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2621.1600000000003s)]
*  to be listed as a guard with Drew and Derek White out there and even Jalen Brown. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2624.2400000000002s)]
*  So forget that. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2627.36s)]
*  I think you're right with Mitchell rewarding Cleveland. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2628.7200000000003s)]
*  He's the best player. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2631.04s)]
*  Uh, so I think the LeBron thing kind of takes care of itself. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2632.48s)]
*  And Mitchell has been awesome in big games too. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2634.7599999999998s)]
*  I think he deserves it. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2636.52s)]
*  I'm not even saying I was, I just thought at least like being creative. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2638.12s)]
*  What was the other argument if we wanted to try to play around with the idea that [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2641.4s)]
*  it wasn't like set in stone for first team. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2645.92s)]
*  LeBron like the last six weeks, it's something like 29, 10 and seven. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2648.36s)]
*  Something like that. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2653.92s)]
*  And he's playing like great defense and he's like their best rebounder. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2654.84s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2658.16s)]
*  He was in there. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2658.88s)]
*  He had forged his way into the combo. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2659.44s)]
*  There's no question. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2661.48s)]
*  He's at 58 games though. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2662.64s)]
*  So it'll be interesting. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2664.0s)]
*  Is he going to be able to get seven more out of the, I don't know how many more. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2665.12s)]
*  So if you had to pick two of Edwards, Brunson, Cade, if you're going to go [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2669.16s)]
*  traditional, how would you rank those three just with the all NBA seasons they're [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2673.64s)]
*  having? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2678.44s)]
*  Cause I would have Brunson, Cade, Edwards third. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2679.56s)]
*  Cause I think what Cade's doing on Detroit is unbelievable. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2683.56s)]
*  I would say though, like I get the ant thing and stats are great. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2686.5200000000004s)]
*  Records are on there. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2691.48s)]
*  It's a battle. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2692.6000000000004s)]
*  They're the same record. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2693.4s)]
*  I mean, Minnesota has one more win. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2694.36s)]
*  They both have 29 losses. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2695.76s)]
*  So I think you could probably, if you really want to push and say, well, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2697.1600000000003s)]
*  ants doing it 36 to 29 with this team in the West, I had an, I had Cade third [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2699.76s)]
*  team, but I think Brunson, it seems like we're both, I think it's kind of [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2705.36s)]
*  interesting that both of us start with Brunson and then it's the other team. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2710.0400000000004s)]
*  I think it's kind of interesting that both of us start with Brunson and then [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2713.12s)]
*  it's the other spot. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2715.56s)]
*  If Brunson misses four weeks with that ankle injury, maybe, maybe that flips, [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2716.96s)]
*  not his fault, but it might, that might be the thing. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2721.8399999999997s)]
*  Do you have cat second team? [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2725.08s)]
*  I it's cat versus triple J. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2727.12s)]
*  I think there's been some tough cat games lately. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2729.08s)]
*  You agree? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2732.64s)]
*  Been a couple, couple cringers. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2734.4s)]
*  Yeah, but he's been so good. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2736.96s)]
*  He didn't even take a shot in that. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2737.96s)]
*  He'd take a shot in the Laker game in the fourth quarter of OTA. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2739.6s)]
*  They didn't run a play for him. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2742.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2745.2000000000003s)]
*  But I think, you know, look what he's done over the full course of the season. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2745.4s)]
*  I get it. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2748.76s)]
*  Pretty remarkable, especially if we were going by traditional center. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2749.32s)]
*  I actually played center 54 games. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2753.36s)]
*  I get it. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2756.1200000000003s)]
*  I just think with, uh, with Jackson on Memphis, um, that team's 38 and 24. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2756.76s)]
*  Although they've lost four straight and they never seem to know if [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2765.28s)]
*  Jaws playing or not. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2768.72s)]
*  And, uh, he's the most reliable guy they have. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2770.6s)]
*  I would, I had towns, but I don't, he's, he's not in a pen. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2774.04s)]
*  So were you doing four, are you doing three forwards and two guards then [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2779.44s)]
*  second team? [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2782.56s)]
*  I right now had towns, LeBron, Edwards, Brunson and Kate. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2783.7999999999997s)]
*  I had them all in, but I'm not going to keep it that way because I'm, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2788.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm still going to go traditional, even though they gave us the out to [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2791.08s)]
*  fuck around with the position. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2793.64s)]
*  What about Mowgli? [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2794.72s)]
*  I had Mowgli third team. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2796.04s)]
*  And if, and if it has to be two forwards, I would move Mowgli to second team [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2797.36s)]
*  because of the defense and some of the other stuff. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2801.68s)]
*  And I got to say, like, I think Jalen Williams has to be a third team right [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2804.2s)]
*  now with the record of that team. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2807.4s)]
*  And, uh, and then it's just wide open after that. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2810.08s)]
*  Cause I, the way Jalen Brown has played for the last four or five weeks, I [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2814.08s)]
*  think he's played himself back into the combo. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2817.7599999999998s)]
*  Um, Hardin's got to be in there. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2820.48s)]
*  Halliburton has been a lot better lately. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2823.44s)]
*  Garland. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2825.44s)]
*  Halliburton's at least like, I wrote the name down. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2825.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2828.6800000000003s)]
*  He's Halliburton is in the conversation again. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2828.88s)]
*  Um, Garland is in like the distant conversation. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2832.12s)]
*  What about Steph? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2836.2000000000003s)]
*  Who would you go, Steph or Garland? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2837.04s)]
*  Well, Steph is the other one. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2839.12s)]
*  And I, and the way Steph has been playing, I would have Steph over Garland [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2840.56s)]
*  because I think what's happening to Steph, Steph's the one to watch. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2844.04s)]
*  Steph's the one with the arrow pointing next to him in the, on the, uh, record [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2847.96s)]
*  charts, cause he's got the swagger back. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2851.88s)]
*  Did you watch, did you end up watching Pistons Warriors last night? [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2854.4s)]
*  Yeah, I watched it after the Lakers. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2857.32s)]
*  I had it on one of the small TVs. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2858.76s)]
*  Ugh. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2860.36s)]
*  It's big Stu. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2861.84s)]
*  Big Stu is just like, I'm getting, he's like, I'm starting something with somebody. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2862.88s)]
*  He's on the bench. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2866.84s)]
*  He starts something anyway, but, uh, they played two really good games this year. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2867.6s)]
*  Pistons and Warriors. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2871.48s)]
*  Pistons making a late run for league pass MVP. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2872.7200000000003s)]
*  The Rockets had it locked up 40 games into the year. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2876.6s)]
*  Now the Pistons are like, they're climbing up there. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2879.1600000000003s)]
*  They're climbing up there. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2882.2s)]
*  They they've just had a lot of good ones. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2883.72s)]
*  The Pistons made it hard on them. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2886.56s)]
*  I, you know, you just kind of expected Golden State's going to put together a [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2888.08s)]
*  few nice possessions here and it's going to be a wrap and it just, it wasn't, I [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2890.68s)]
*  mean, Draymond Green hitting a three of all people to kind of close the game out. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2893.72s)]
*  They made it really hard on Golden State. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2898.2s)]
*  Like those possessions towards the last, I don't know, six minutes or so, or the [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2900.56s)]
*  fourth quarter and this Beasley story has been unbelievable and unbelievable. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2904.56s)]
*  All those guys want to get into it with you. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2909.52s)]
*  And that's why I feel like big Stu was left out. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2911.88s)]
*  It was a massive overreaction getting upset with Steph feeling [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2913.84s)]
*  himself a little bit. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2917.32s)]
*  He was in front of their bench, but it wasn't, he was falling down on the guys, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2918.56s)]
*  but Stuart doesn't care and teams need guys like that. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2921.8s)]
*  He's gone after Steph and LeBron in his career. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2925.44s)]
*  And that has to be the only person. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2930.2s)]
*  I hope there's not like a magic appreciation night for the next time the [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2933.2799999999997s)]
*  Pistons play the Lakers walk right up to them. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2936.88s)]
*  Kerr had a, they had one of those post-game locker room speeches after the Brooklyn [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2941.96s)]
*  game Kerr gave a speech and you know, it was basically like an NFL film speech, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2945.6800000000003s)]
*  but, um, at the end was talking about, we know we're going to win these close [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2951.8s)]
*  games now we know how good we are in these close games. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2957.04s)]
*  Like he basically, their whole thing for the first 45, 50 games of the year was. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2960.2000000000003s)]
*  Why do we suck in the clutch? [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2965.6s)]
*  We have Steph Curry. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2966.8399999999997s)]
*  Why aren't we winning these games? [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2967.72s)]
*  How are we blowing these games late? [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2969.0s)]
*  What the fuck is happening? [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2970.6s)]
*  This team now, and you can feel it last night with the Pistons game, which was a [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2972.16s)]
*  tight game and it was a back and forth. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2975.7999999999997s)]
*  And I was watching and thinking the words are going to win the key play of the [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2977.7599999999998s)]
*  game, Jimmy Butler left corner takes Tobias off and hits like an 18 footer. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2981.44s)]
*  And it was like, they just didn't have that. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2987.08s)]
*  You couldn't go to Wiggins in that spot. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2989.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2990.72s)]
*  It's just whatever happened that Butler trade, everyone fell into place. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2991.3199999999997s)]
*  Moody became a better defensive guy and, uh, I I'm taking them very seriously. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2994.12s)]
*  Still going to state. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=2999.68s)]
*  Could they win four straight rounds? [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3002.3599999999997s)]
*  Probably not, but would I want to see them in any round? [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3003.68s)]
*  Would I want to see them in any round? [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3007.24s)]
*  No. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3008.2799999999997s)]
*  Would they be totally comfortable playing? [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3008.8399999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3010.72s)]
*  See, yes. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3011.0s)]
*  They love playing. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3012.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3013.08s)]
*  See those games are always good with that. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3013.3599999999997s)]
*  Or is wide open and crazy. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3014.92s)]
*  And, uh, I think they could absolutely hang with them in a series. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3016.56s)]
*  I don't think they would win it, but I think they can hang. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3020.12s)]
*  You could be asking a lot of loony against okay. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3021.88s)]
*  See, because you'd have to go back to that and they've liked using Quinton [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3023.8s)]
*  post here just to space it out. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3028.92s)]
*  That makes it last night. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3031.28s)]
*  Last night, big air ball last night. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3032.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3034.56s)]
*  It's interesting though, like looking around the league, you're seeing teams [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3034.92s)]
*  go with some of this double big stuff. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3037.6800000000003s)]
*  Boston has been doing a little bit more when Przingus is playing Oklahoma city [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3039.4s)]
*  basically admitted, Hey, the rest of this year, we're kind of experimenting [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3043.04s)]
*  with what we have here and there'll be times where I think, okay, they're going [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3046.28s)]
*  to split chet and heart up again in this game. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3048.6800000000003s)]
*  They're going to split chet and heart up again, and then they bring them both out. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3050.32s)]
*  And that speaks to just, you want to talk about an organization that's okay. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3053.36s)]
*  Night to night going, let's see what we have and what these combinations look [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3057.0800000000004s)]
*  like and have we found something with this double big Houston's been doing it [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3061.4s)]
*  where it's a little bit different depending on what, how you want to describe [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3065.2400000000002s)]
*  it with Shingu and or Jabari, but they've been doing Steven Adams with your bar. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3068.56s)]
*  There's been some of these teams that have tried some of this double big stuff, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3072.0s)]
*  but then I've also watched nights where teams are just closing it out really, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3074.7200000000003s)]
*  really small. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3078.0s)]
*  And I don't know if some of these teams that would prefer to close small are [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3079.52s)]
*  going to run into something in a playoff matchup where it's just, it's just too [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3083.6s)]
*  much like where PJ Tucker was trying to play center for the Rockets. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3087.08s)]
*  I don't know if it'll be that extreme. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3090.68s)]
*  PJ Tucker on the Knicks now they said experienced veteran and an enforcer. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3092.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3100.52s)]
*  That's great. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3100.88s)]
*  That's great. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3101.88s)]
*  On paper, big sense. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3103.8s)]
*  We're going to take a break and come back with our friend, Brian Curtis. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3105.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3108.08s)]
*  We're bringing in a third party here to spruce things up. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3108.36s)]
*  It's like an episode of white Lotus. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3111.4s)]
*  Brian Curtis is here editor at large of the ring. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3113.0s)]
*  You can hear him in the press box. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3114.96s)]
*  A great podcast. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3116.48s)]
*  Also Dallas fan. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3117.72s)]
*  Is Dallas going to be okay? [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3120.56s)]
*  Curtis, what's give us the update. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3121.56s)]
*  My God, I just watched Dallas right now. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3124.52s)]
*  Did you see that sad Mark Cuban interview? [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3126.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3129.24s)]
*  He finally broke his silence and he said, part of the reason I wanted to sell the [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3130.04s)]
*  team is because I didn't want my kids to make a move like trading away Luca in his [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3134.44s)]
*  prime and then they would get roasted on social media. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3140.08s)]
*  I was like, is that the reason you sold the team? [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3144.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3147.76s)]
*  I'm not going to buy that story. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3147.92s)]
*  Mark Cuban. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3150.08s)]
*  How bad can this get worse? [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3151.28s)]
*  How would it get worse at this point? [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3155.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3156.92s)]
*  Rossello, do you ever remember an NBA fan base being this upset at a team before [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3157.8s)]
*  since you followed basketball? [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3164.3199999999997s)]
*  Seattle. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3167.08s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3169.12s)]
*  I guess that's the last level. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3169.8399999999997s)]
*  The team actually has to just move. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3171.08s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3173.0s)]
*  Would you rather be a Sonic's fan or a Mavericks fan? [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3173.68s)]
*  Well, if you're a Sonic's fan, you know, you're at least getting an expansion team. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3177.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3181.3999999999996s)]
*  But they're just gone. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3181.6s)]
*  Whereas now with the Mavs, they're still here. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3184.04s)]
*  And I'm so glad you brought up that Cuban quote. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3186.52s)]
*  He has been on a bender of quotes the last couple of years. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3188.56s)]
*  There's just no way that you were like, you know what? [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3192.84s)]
*  The number one priority is my offspring avoiding criticism, being faced with [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3195.7200000000003s)]
*  a task of something like this. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3201.4s)]
*  At least he had said, make a better deal. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3202.84s)]
*  Like finally, he said what everybody else had collectively agreed to here. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3205.08s)]
*  Cause whenever that trade, I mean, like I still haven't gotten over it. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3209.04s)]
*  You just see people on TV, people like, Hey, people are acting like Anthony. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3213.08s)]
*  No one's acting like Anthony Davis is bad. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3216.04s)]
*  We can't believe this trade happened is the only point in the way that it, that [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3218.7599999999998s)]
*  it happened, which we've already covered a million different times. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3223.3999999999996s)]
*  Um, so I was glad to hear Cuban say that. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3225.72s)]
*  Just do a better deal. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3227.72s)]
*  We still don't know why Cuban sold, why he sold when he did, what the reasons for [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3228.96s)]
*  there's, there's some not so conspiracy conspiracy theories about it. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3233.7999999999997s)]
*  It was an organization that had gotten into some trouble behind the [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3238.4399999999996s)]
*  scenes in a couple of different ways. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3241.3999999999996s)]
*  Um, there was always rumors about maybe he wasn't as liquid as people thought. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3243.24s)]
*  But, and it was a deal that he made like a year before the deal actually happened. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3248.2s)]
*  Um, and, and weirdly he sold pretty low for what the value of the franchise [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3252.6s)]
*  probably was considering he had a top five guy, there's still some stuff [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3257.08s)]
*  that hasn't added up for me. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3260.6s)]
*  Would you agree Curtis? [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3262.24s)]
*  I would. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3263.3199999999997s)]
*  And my podcast pal in Dallas, Jake Kent brought up another one, which is what [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3263.9199999999996s)]
*  happened to Mark Cuban running basketball operations with the Mavericks? [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3268.08s)]
*  Well, that we knew that was bullshit though. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3271.56s)]
*  But it wasn't, it was covered, wasn't covered that way to Curtis's point. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3273.52s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3276.56s)]
*  True. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3277.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, cause people just bought what he was saying was like, no, no, I'm still [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3277.92s)]
*  going to be involved and that's it's never worked that way ever. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3280.64s)]
*  And so it was not in any contract that he signed when he sold his share [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3283.64s)]
*  of the Mavericks for 3.5 billion. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3287.08s)]
*  This was just purely a, Hey, you can stay in on basketball thing. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3288.88s)]
*  And Mark Cuban was cool with that. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3292.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3294.56s)]
*  Mark Cuban sold that to the public. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3294.7999999999997s)]
*  Like these guys told me this, but it's not in this incredibly complicated [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3296.8399999999997s)]
*  contract I just signed to sell the team. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3301.8399999999997s)]
*  Well, it's interesting because he's not getting villainized [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3304.64s)]
*  at all for the Luca thing. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3307.16s)]
*  And it's a little similar to, um, when the Sonics left Seattle and everybody blamed [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3308.92s)]
*  the guys that bought the team and then moved them to OKC. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3313.32s)]
*  This is, we did the Sonic boom podcast about it, but Howard Schultz, the guy [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3316.08s)]
*  that owned the Sonics, who the Starbucks guy, he was just as big of a villain [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3319.84s)]
*  because he sold the team to these guys knowing they were probably going to move [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3324.28s)]
*  them, but then he's like, well, I didn't know that, you know, you can play dumb. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3328.2400000000002s)]
*  You can do all you want. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3331.12s)]
*  In this case, Cuban's selling the franchise to these guys who clearly [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3332.52s)]
*  didn't know what this family that clearly didn't know what they were doing. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3336.2799999999997s)]
*  Who knows what their intentions were. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3338.64s)]
*  And it's almost like, could he have put in the deal? [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3340.52s)]
*  You're not allowed to trade Luca dot church for the entire 2020s. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3342.6s)]
*  It's like, maybe he should have put something in there like that, but that's [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3345.68s)]
*  not why we brought Brian Curtis on NBA media discourse in 2025. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3348.64s)]
*  It feels like we're in the weirdest place we've ever been culminating on. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3355.2799999999997s)]
*  Thursday night between the third and fourth quarter of a Lakers game on [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3360.04s)]
*  national TV, LeBron James walks over and gets in, um, Steve and a Smith's face [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3363.88s)]
*  about stuff he said about his son. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3370.52s)]
*  And it goes viral that night and Steven a. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3373.28s)]
*  He wasn't pro, you know, he feels like he had to address it. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3378.1600000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3381.4s)]
*  Rossello, he may, he might not have addressed it otherwise, but once it [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3381.6s)]
*  went viral, he didn't want to, he didn't want to, might not ever come up. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3384.44s)]
*  He had to address it. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3388.2000000000003s)]
*  And then it's this two, three days cycle. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3389.88s)]
*  Where are we going? [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3393.6800000000003s)]
*  Curtis, what, what, what's the end game here? [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3395.0s)]
*  What is the end game with just the media getting louder and louder and becoming [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3398.8s)]
*  part of the story in all these different ways, something that I'm not sure anybody [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3402.64s)]
*  likes, but it just feels like we're getting more and more of it. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3407.12s)]
*  It's so funny because not only do we have Steven a reluctantly addressing it on [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3410.4s)]
*  first take and then on his podcast also also reluctant because he had more to say. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3414.88s)]
*  The two hour show wasn't enough. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3419.64s)]
*  My other favorite detail was that he mentioned he was sitting with [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3421.76s)]
*  Ari Emmanuel and Larry David. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3424.2000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3426.12s)]
*  Not germane to the LeBron confrontation, but just wanted to let everybody know [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3426.7200000000003s)]
*  that that's who we're sitting with there in the curb, your enthusiasm [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3430.4s)]
*  trip, shack seats, same seats. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3433.92s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3437.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3438.7200000000003s)]
*  He also said, you know, if LeBron called me, I would take the call. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3439.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3443.6s)]
*  So I would not send the most famous basketball player in the world to [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3444.1600000000003s)]
*  voicemail repeatedly. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3447.56s)]
*  Did clear that up. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3449.72s)]
*  It's good to hear in the, in the thing I did. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3451.32s)]
*  By the way, we can talk about, there's so many things to talk about, but the [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3453.84s)]
*  whole Stephen a thing that really, they got me was he said, you know, why didn't [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3456.68s)]
*  LeBron or why didn't clutch call me and hash this out? [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3460.24s)]
*  And I'm, you know, in certain ways we can talk about the brawny part of this. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3463.48s)]
*  Cause I think I'm sympathetic to a lot of what Stephen had said about brawny [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3466.72s)]
*  and the idea that brought somehow brawny is talking about brawny is talking about [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3469.96s)]
*  your family and crossing this red line. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3473.2s)]
*  Like I, I don't totally buy that, but the whole idea was like, wait, if we say [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3476.48s)]
*  something on a podcast or he says something on television, does that mean [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3480.0s)]
*  the person who's aggrieved can only respond to us privately? [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3483.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3488.6s)]
*  So we say it publicly, but then they need to keep all their [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3489.12s)]
*  business behind closed doors. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3491.68s)]
*  Like, wait, if you had a problem, why didn't you call me? [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3493.16s)]
*  Well, you said it on TV, whatever I'm upset about. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3494.84s)]
*  Like, shouldn't they, they're media figures too, in a way, shouldn't they? [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3499.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3502.44s)]
*  Anyway, that also tripped me up a little bit. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3503.04s)]
*  I doing it during a game was pretty unusual. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3504.92s)]
*  That was different. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3507.52s)]
*  I don't know if that's happened before. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3509.44s)]
*  I think it's a win for LeBron though. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3511.16s)]
*  I think it's a win for LeBron in that moment. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3512.56s)]
*  Cause it looks cool. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3514.2s)]
*  It does. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3516.36s)]
*  Well, especially he's what six inches taller, five inches taller. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3516.96s)]
*  He looks intimidating. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3521.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3523.56s)]
*  See, I think he's a pretty theatrical guy. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3523.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3526.68s)]
*  And it was a moment to kind of look like this whole thing gets really, really weird. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3527.28s)]
*  Cause if somebody's like, Hey, that's just a father carrying around his son. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3532.44s)]
*  Like you don't want to tell somebody that they're wrong about it. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3535.04s)]
*  But the reason why the rules for this has changed is that ultimately once Ronnie has [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3536.84s)]
*  an NBA uniform on, like this is, this is what we do and we're going to talk about it. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3540.76s)]
*  And he's going to get way more criticism than somebody else who's not playing [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3545.48s)]
*  because of the lead up. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3549.52s)]
*  And that it felt like the most important thing was to show the power of clutch. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3550.64s)]
*  If you were able to get this guy a guaranteed contract for three years, cause I [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3554.64s)]
*  think the fourth year is an option. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3557.8s)]
*  So it's a big win. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3558.96s)]
*  Look what we can do. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3560.0s)]
*  We pulled this off and, and all this stuff. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3560.88s)]
*  And it's kind of celebrated by the Lakers. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3563.4s)]
*  Like look at this. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3565.08s)]
*  We're going to make history. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3566.0s)]
*  They were smart, get it over with, have him play with his father immediately. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3566.92s)]
*  I think there's elements of it where you can go, okay, I understand that part of it. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3570.36s)]
*  But they, I think they misunderstood how nasty it was going to get if he continued [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3574.76s)]
*  to look like the player that those of us that did the draft tape for his USC thing, [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3581.6800000000003s)]
*  where it just felt like he never really stood out. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3586.6400000000003s)]
*  But you remember selling the selling point of Ronnie was that he was a glue guy. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3588.44s)]
*  Like who takes glue guys in the draft? [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3592.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3594.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3595.84s)]
*  He's six one, not a point guard, not a shooter glue guy. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3596.0800000000004s)]
*  Who's the comp is Davion Mitchell. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3600.84s)]
*  Ultimately that, that was the question. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3603.04s)]
*  Could it be Davion Mitchell? [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3605.2400000000002s)]
*  Who's like a ninth man. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3606.6000000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3608.6000000000004s)]
*  But I don't know, Curtis, if you're probably a little bit more tuned into it than I am, [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3608.84s)]
*  but do you feel like Stephen A had crossed a line that deserved that showdown, that, [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3613.36s)]
*  that staredown with LeBron? [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3620.6000000000004s)]
*  So there's not a, like, you know, library of Congress transcript of everything [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3622.6400000000003s)]
*  Stephen A said about Bronte, which I wouldn't have had time to read even if there was. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3627.6400000000003s)]
*  But I think this all starts in January. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3633.32s)]
*  There's that game against the Sixers and Stephen A had a couple of hits after that [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3635.4s)]
*  about Bronte, but really what he said was LeBron put you, put his, putting his son in a bad [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3639.88s)]
*  situation. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3645.96s)]
*  He shadow GMing his son to the Lakers. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3646.92s)]
*  He has the tweet. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3649.48s)]
*  What was that out two years ago? [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3650.6800000000003s)]
*  Like Bronte's better than guys I'm watching on league pass. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3651.92s)]
*  It sets him up as being really, really good. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3654.6400000000003s)]
*  And then he put him in a bad situation and that as his dad and as the, one of the [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3657.04s)]
*  greatest basketball players of all time, you should know that this isn't a great place [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3661.52s)]
*  for him to be in right now. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3665.2400000000002s)]
*  It's just not, that was the point. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3667.4s)]
*  I mean, again, and again, it's Stephen A, so it has, you know, I'm not doing it justice [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3669.68s)]
*  probably. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3674.32s)]
*  And if LeBron's watching that, I'm sure he can find some phrase or something to latch [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3674.72s)]
*  onto, but that was the point. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3678.24s)]
*  And that's a discussion you guys have had 1000 times about LeBron James and the Lakers. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3679.52s)]
*  Well, I think when you get to the, the opening night and you put the Griffey's courtside [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3684.48s)]
*  and you do all that stuff, you're, you're bringing attention to something and then to [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3688.88s)]
*  expect people not to discuss it in the merits of it. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3692.52s)]
*  I think seems pretty naive. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3695.88s)]
*  I think Ken Griffey senior turned to junior was like, so he go number one too. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3697.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3701.7999999999997s)]
*  Or did he go with the fuck? [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3703.12s)]
*  Like we were amazing. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3704.6s)]
*  I dunno. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3708.7599999999998s)]
*  I just feel bad for Bronnie. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3709.04s)]
*  I like, uh, that's, that's why we haven't really talked about it that much on this [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3710.68s)]
*  pod. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3715.84s)]
*  You know, he seems like a nice kid. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3716.44s)]
*  I've always heard good things about him and I don't, I don't necessarily think he asked [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3718.24s)]
*  to be in this situation, but to expect people not to talk about it is pretty nuts. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3721.84s)]
*  Um, but what I love though was like the lead up to it and then he was drafted and you had [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3726.64s)]
*  people on TV all of a sudden. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3730.56s)]
*  Trying to talk themselves into it. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3732.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3733.32s)]
*  But they were pro nepotism. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3733.56s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3735.64s)]
*  It's like, this is, this is a good thing. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3736.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3738.2s)]
*  This is like, this happens in every other walk of life. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3738.52s)]
*  Why can't it happen here? [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3740.44s)]
*  And I just always felt like it was a really simple explanation to me because this one [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3741.72s)]
*  gets a uniform. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3745.04s)]
*  Well, this is, this is different than going the back and being charged of travel. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3746.96s)]
*  What's the bigger picture thing? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3753.8s)]
*  Take Lebron out of it. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3755.64s)]
*  That Stephen A who I think has been promoted by the network a certain way, right. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3757.4s)]
*  As like a star on the level of the stars that we're watching in these games, right. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3762.08s)]
*  Right down to the playoff games when they're two, instead of having the walk-ins with, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3766.3599999999997s)]
*  you know, Jalen Brunson or whoever, it's Stephen A walking into a Knicks game and [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3771.52s)]
*  they're covering it like he's an all NBA guy. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3775.16s)]
*  And this just seems like the philosophy of the network now is to be loud, loud, [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3777.7999999999997s)]
*  loud, loud, loud. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3783.3199999999997s)]
*  It used to be some sort of a balance of like, let's do some really good stuff and [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3785.2000000000003s)]
*  let's have a couple pieces of what we're doing, be loud. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3789.6400000000003s)]
*  But for the most part, we're going to try to be a whole bunch of things. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3794.04s)]
*  And now it seems like the loud is winning Curtis. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3796.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3799.76s)]
*  You know, when you said we haven't seen this on the court, we have seen this in [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3800.56s)]
*  the locker room a bunch of times, including by the way, with Joel Embiid earlier [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3804.48s)]
*  this year. This is a pretty standard locker room, media member, you know, [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3809.0s)]
*  athlete confrontation. I don't like what you said about me. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3815.04s)]
*  I don't like what you wrote about, but the difference is what you point to. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3817.64s)]
*  Stephen A had almost literally just agreed to a hundred million dollar a year [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3820.44s)]
*  contract. He's a face of the network. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3824.8s)]
*  A hundred million total contract. A hundred million a year would be a lot. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3827.32s)]
*  Excuse me. Yes, that's a lot, but he's the face of the network. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3829.2400000000002s)]
*  And as you say, it's a face of ESPN's approach. And with ESPN, [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3832.68s)]
*  I think there's an interesting question of whether they're doing more of this [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3836.28s)]
*  kind of stuff or whether the other stuff at ESPN has just been stripped away to [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3839.7200000000003s)]
*  such a degree that this becomes a bigger part of ESPN. You see what I mean? [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3844.56s)]
*  Like when you get rid of Zach Lowe, [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3849.76s)]
*  when you chop off all these parts of ESPN, [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3852.7200000000003s)]
*  Stephen A is just going to be a larger part of the network. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3856.2400000000002s)]
*  He's just going to seem bigger whether he actually is, you know, [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3859.4s)]
*  occupying more hours of air time or not. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3863.6400000000003s)]
*  What do you think, Rossello? [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3866.44s)]
*  Do you feel like there's been a subtle shift of how they're presenting [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3868.12s)]
*  stuff? [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3872.84s)]
*  Is this just the way social media and the way people follow sports in 2025? [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3873.4s)]
*  Is this just they're serving the red meat to the people who want to eat the red [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3878.2400000000002s)]
*  meat? What is this? [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3881.56s)]
*  I've argued now for years where I felt like I finally figured it out is that the [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3883.92s)]
*  audience gets what we want. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3887.76s)]
*  So I think the audience actually does like this stuff. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3890.08s)]
*  I had more friends ask me about who side I was on between LeBron and Stephen A [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3892.48s)]
*  than any other basketball question I've been asked by my friends this entire [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3896.2400000000002s)]
*  season. So I think it is a win for ESPN. I think it's a win for Stephen A. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3899.52s)]
*  I mean, you can get into whether or not somebody should be doing this on TV. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3905.12s)]
*  Like remember four years ago when he went at Durant and like looked at the [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3908.28s)]
*  camera, it was like, give me the, give me the solo shot. It was like, [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3911.16s)]
*  you don't want to go at me. And I remember watching it going, [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3914.88s)]
*  would I ever, [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3918.6400000000003s)]
*  would I ever be at a position where I was threatening somebody else on TV? [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3919.76s)]
*  I don't know that I'd ever really want to be that way, but I mean, this is all, [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3925.88s)]
*  whether it's, it's good or bad, it's all a win. It's all a win for Stephen A. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3928.76s)]
*  We spent 20 minutes talking about him and this is exactly what he would want. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3932.1200000000003s)]
*  So that's what I think. I think that's how you keep score of this. Yeah. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3934.84s)]
*  A couple of days earlier, Barclay had that whole thing. He starts the show. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3939.76s)]
*  They clearly planned on, I'm going to take some shots at the competition. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3944.0s)]
*  And then Stephen A spun it after, like, he wasn't talking about me, [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3949.52s)]
*  Charles and I are good. And it was like, [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3953.36s)]
*  I think he was talking about your whole the first take in countdown. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3954.92s)]
*  He was definitely talking about the way ESPN covers basketball, [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3958.2400000000002s)]
*  which you're a part of. It wasn't just directed to Perkins, [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3961.2s)]
*  but then Perkins came back and that was another thing that happened. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3964.54s)]
*  And all of this happened, [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3967.76s)]
*  I think the same day where we had rival guys on two different networks, [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3969.52s)]
*  taking shots at each other who might end up, you know, [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3974.68s)]
*  they're not really working together cause they're producing a show out of [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3978.16s)]
*  Atlanta and then the Steve May thing. And it's just like, [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3980.48s)]
*  is this just what we are now? [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3983.36s)]
*  Yeah. And it ends with Kenan Thompson wearing a beard on weekend update. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3985.84s)]
*  Like that's, that was doing a Perkins impersonation. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3989.08s)]
*  We got a Trump parody and we got a, we got a perk parody. Like that's, [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3992.08s)]
*  think about that. There's, [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3996.12s)]
*  there's someone doing a Kendrick Perkins impersonation on Saturday Night Live. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=3997.3199999999997s)]
*  That's a win for Kendrick Perkins. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4000.68s)]
*  100%. Big win. 100%. Yeah. If you had said, Hey, [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4002.24s)]
*  do you think this will happen one day? Right. Like, no, [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4005.72s)]
*  like how would Perkins ever be relevant enough for somebody to be doing an [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4010.3599999999997s)]
*  impersonation of him on Saturday Night Live? So there you go. That's the win for him. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4013.52s)]
*  So I think all of these things are wins. Not that, you know, Hey, [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4016.72s)]
*  all PR is good PR. Cause I think I'd push back on a few stories, uh, [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4020.04s)]
*  from famous people. Like, I don't know if that's good. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4023.84s)]
*  I don't know if that's going to help that person. Yeah. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4025.6800000000003s)]
*  The TNT countdown deal, like TNT gets to be a show. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4027.8s)]
*  Like there can be plenty of shows that I like or don't like on certain nights. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4032.6000000000004s)]
*  If I want to sit here and bash TNT, I could and go, [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4035.84s)]
*  you mean the show that in this, [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4038.92s)]
*  in this world where the NBA is trying to figure out where it fits in and all the [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4041.0800000000004s)]
*  criticisms of it and the projections of different ratings arguments that I think [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4044.1200000000003s)]
*  some are valid and a lot are terrible where you have all of these players from [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4047.52s)]
*  previous eras just shitting on the product all the time. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4052.24s)]
*  But then that's why everybody kind of loves the show, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4055.0s)]
*  but at least they're allowed to be a show when they're done with the second game [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4057.3199999999997s)]
*  on Thursday night. Those guys hang out all night and it's loose and they get to be [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4060.16s)]
*  a real studio show. And when I look at what ESPN asks of it's on air people, [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4065.04s)]
*  I don't even think it's a fair fight. Even if you don't like anyone that's on ESPN, [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4070.0s)]
*  which I wouldn't say that's my position. There's some people where I'm like, [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4074.04s)]
*  okay, you know what? I like where this person is coming from. All right, [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4077.64s)]
*  this one, I probably know what I'm going to get here. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4080.84s)]
*  I don't watch a ton of them cause I have to watch so many games that I want to [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4083.4s)]
*  spend extra time watching studio stuff. Like when the second TNT games over, [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4085.96s)]
*  I'll probably go and watch another game that I wasn't really watching that [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4090.28s)]
*  closely. But whenever anything's compared to TNT, [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4093.0800000000004s)]
*  I don't know that people in television, well, [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4095.88s)]
*  people on television should understand. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4098.360000000001s)]
*  I don't know that we talk about enough of like the room that they're given to [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4099.56s)]
*  be the show that everybody else wants to emulate, [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4104.4400000000005s)]
*  but never lets their people on air have the same opportunity and same structure. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4107.8s)]
*  Yeah. It's eight minute half times. It's an hour after the game. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4112.72s)]
*  I'm saying an eight minute segment just in a row. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4118.04s)]
*  ESPN segment might be three minutes. You know, you have four people, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4121.0s)]
*  you gotta move it. You gotta move around. They'll actually have a conversation. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4124.4400000000005s)]
*  I was always jealous of it. Yeah. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4128.0s)]
*  I feel like with these pregame postgame halftime shows, [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4130.400000000001s)]
*  the postgame show is always going to win Curtis because you're reacting to [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4135.08s)]
*  something we just saw. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4139.400000000001s)]
*  It's the same reason why we do a lot of emergency pods or pods right after [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4140.240000000001s)]
*  games because it's like this just happened. What'd you think is always going to win. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4144.4800000000005s)]
*  And ESPN, a lot of their stuff is steered toward coming up later. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4148.64s)]
*  What do you think's going to happen? I think this is going to happen. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4152.360000000001s)]
*  I think Jalen Brown's going to have a big game. It's just not, cause you're, [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4156.0s)]
*  you know, there's only so much you can do with that stuff, [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4159.8s)]
*  but being able to react to what just happened is a huge advantage. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4162.0s)]
*  The other thing is the TNT show is a comedy show. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4165.56s)]
*  Like my wife will be sitting next to me like on her phone. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4168.16s)]
*  And when those guys come on and she sees Barkley, [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4170.96s)]
*  like she's interested for six minutes cause she thinks those guys are funny. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4173.32s)]
*  And I don't, you know, no other show has that. I don't think. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4177.36s)]
*  I completely agree about the postgame thing. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4180.96s)]
*  And that's why the late sports center with SVP is often better because he's got [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4182.64s)]
*  the guy on who just won the game. He's doing the breakdown of the game, [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4186.44s)]
*  whether it's football or basketball. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4189.2s)]
*  I felt some of the angst from the TNT thing is about moving to ESPN too. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4191.2s)]
*  I mean, that was clearly part of it, right? Hey, we got this great show over here. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4195.679999999999s)]
*  We're moving over there. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4199.12s)]
*  We all about. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4201.28s)]
*  They're doing it out of Atlanta still though, right? They're, they're, [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4202.12s)]
*  they're basically being simulcast on ESPN. I guess they're moving there. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4205.5599999999995s)]
*  Do you think they're worried things are going to change? [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4210.4s)]
*  I don't, I just, it, it felt to me like going from place A to place B was part [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4212.32s)]
*  of the subtext of that, you know, [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4217.719999999999s)]
*  we created this, we won right for 20 years. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4220.240000000001s)]
*  We won the studio show war over ESPN. Now they're paying us to come over there. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4222.96s)]
*  Some of us got new contracts, [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4228.08s)]
*  which we heard a ton about for the last year and changed to go over there. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4229.56s)]
*  But it also felt like that was a little bit of what Barkley was saying. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4234.320000000001s)]
*  Those bozos over there, whatever word he used, and now we're going over there. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4237.8s)]
*  That was, that was interesting to me. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4242.52s)]
*  Well, do you feel so the main, [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4244.16s)]
*  his main critique was all they do is talk about the Lakers and, [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4245.56s)]
*  and, uh, you know, and the Celtics and the Knicks and, you know, [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4250.76s)]
*  that's in Steven A's response was, well, we have two hours. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4255.400000000001s)]
*  And we have eight segments. I mean, and if you do, [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4259.68s)]
*  I haven't watched a lot of two hour first takes, [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4262.080000000001s)]
*  but they do bounce around a lot of stuff. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4264.280000000001s)]
*  What they lead with is usually the biggest teams. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4266.120000000001s)]
*  We're so they've been doing that since you were a young pup there. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4269.52s)]
*  They're always going to push people toward talk Lakers, talk Cowboys, [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4273.36s)]
*  talk Yankees, like whoever the biggest teams are. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4276.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. But I mean, [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4279.72s)]
*  it's also a group on TNT who takes pride in not knowing who any of the players [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4280.64s)]
*  are. So like spare me the fucking deep dives guys. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4285.68s)]
*  How come you're not talking about who's better in half court? [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4290.52s)]
*  How can you not talking about switches more? I mean, [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4294.24s)]
*  those guys don't talk about any of that stuff. So I don't, [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4297.04s)]
*  and honestly, I don't know that anybody really wants it. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4301.56s)]
*  Hasn't everybody tried this? [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4303.68s)]
*  Haven't all of us that are like basketball and football nerds, [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4305.360000000001s)]
*  haven't we always talked about how much we would love the idea of all these [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4308.84s)]
*  matchup shows and these deep dive stuff and film study and let's show it. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4311.76s)]
*  Like we've talked about it. Nobody ever wants to do it. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4315.64s)]
*  And when they had it on the NFL, [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4318.0s)]
*  when I used to watch that before the countdown show back when I was a kid and [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4319.360000000001s)]
*  Sal Powell and those guys, I loved it. I loved it. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4323.240000000001s)]
*  And he, and check this out third and seven, [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4327.12s)]
*  the interior feet of hunt at 22 are too far inside the [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4330.12s)]
*  hashes and Neil O'Donnell knows he has the go route to the outside. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4334.599999999999s)]
*  So, you know, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4340.24s)]
*  maybe I was a moron and just thought it was all brilliant shit, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4341.24s)]
*  but I liked it and there's nobody does it. No, I mean, [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4344.599999999999s)]
*  there's people on YouTube doing it and some breakdowns. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4348.759999999999s)]
*  So I don't know if their numbers are really good. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4350.5199999999995s)]
*  Maybe there's some people out there that are doing some really good stuff, [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4351.839999999999s)]
*  but as far as like brand name networks giving you that, [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4353.8s)]
*  is it because everybody in TV is stupid or is it because [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4358.4800000000005s)]
*  people are going to tune in or click on the tab of Steve and A responds to the [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4363.320000000001s)]
*  Brawny disagreement? [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4367.6s)]
*  Well, that's how they on the last thing. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4369.16s)]
*  That's how they sell the headlines of the stuff too. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4371.08s)]
*  Yeah. And it's, it's not a apples to apples. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4373.96s)]
*  Cause if Charles Barkley was hosting a show every weekday morning, [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4376.360000000001s)]
*  the a block would not be thunder and cats. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4379.64s)]
*  That's just not exactly. Yeah. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4383.120000000001s)]
*  The show would not that would just, they would not lead with it. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4385.280000000001s)]
*  I also think that ESPN actually, and maybe it would be surprising. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4387.96s)]
*  They get so much unwarranted shit just because they're [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4391.88s)]
*  the one partner that has all of these other slots to fill. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4396.88s)]
*  Yeah. If TNT didn't have charmed reruns, okay. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4402.280000000001s)]
*  And bones and they had the next guy coming on [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4407.280000000001s)]
*  to talk about something, you know, same thing with like CBS and NFL and the [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4412.24s)]
*  network partners for the, if, if those channels were actually just 24 hour [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4416.84s)]
*  sports stuff, then you would find more stuff that you would have a problem with. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4421.52s)]
*  Look, I don't, I don't love all the coverage that I see. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4425.24s)]
*  It's not for me. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4428.0s)]
*  That's fine. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4429.04s)]
*  Um, I know I'm not, I'm not really the person, any of that stuff is targeted [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4430.4400000000005s)]
*  towards, but I think that's always lost in that there's so many more things to [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4434.2s)]
*  criticize with ESPN because there's just so much more real estate compared to [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4438.48s)]
*  all of these other partners. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4443.48s)]
*  What is the strategy? [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4446.0s)]
*  If you had to describe a big picture content strategy for them, as we head into [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4448.04s)]
*  the heart of the mid 2020s here, Curtis, what would it be? [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4452.0s)]
*  I think every decision or just about every decision they've made over the last [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4457.879999999999s)]
*  couple of years goes to two things. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4462.2s)]
*  Get ready for the first ever ESPN Superbowl in two years. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4465.4400000000005s)]
*  That's Joe and Troy. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4469.4400000000005s)]
*  That's SVP to Monday night countdown. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4470.360000000001s)]
*  That's changing the producer of Monday night football, et cetera. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4471.96s)]
*  Number two, get ready for the launch of flagship this fall. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4474.88s)]
*  They're streaming service. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4478.92s)]
*  And when you think about it like that, you're like, why was it around the [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4480.76s)]
*  horn cancel? [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4483.32s)]
*  Oh, not bucket number one, not bucket number two. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4483.96s)]
*  Why is Zach Lowe no longer there when he's the best basketball writer on the [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4488.0s)]
*  planet? [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4490.88s)]
*  Oh, not number one, not number two. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4491.24s)]
*  And to me, it's so focused on those two things, especially the second thing, [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4493.96s)]
*  especially flagship that you, if you just read it like that, the decisions, [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4498.68s)]
*  whether we agree with them or not, start to all make sense to me. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4503.36s)]
*  And that includes the social media strategy and how they use a lot of those [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4507.92s)]
*  clips because they're just pushing interest and fervor toward that flagship [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4512.16s)]
*  thing, which begs the bigger question. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4516.96s)]
*  Do you think the flagship thing's going to work? [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4519.52s)]
*  That's a question. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4521.2s)]
*  But that's that to me is that's their existential question. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4522.2s)]
*  Like we have to get this thing to work. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4525.24s)]
*  We're moving out of cable world. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4527.0s)]
*  We're moving into streaming world. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4528.84s)]
*  This thing has to work. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4529.88s)]
*  Every decision, right? [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4531.24s)]
*  Why do we buy, pay so much for the college football playoff again? [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4532.56s)]
*  Why do we buy the SEC? [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4534.92s)]
*  Why do we do that? [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4535.84s)]
*  That's all flagship stuff. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4536.4s)]
*  And when you get left out of that conversation, if you're ESPN radio, let's [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4538.28s)]
*  say, right, mentioned around the horn, if you're not in that directly, is there a [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4542.8s)]
*  place anymore? [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4547.24s)]
*  Do they do? [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4547.88s)]
*  Are they that worried about you? [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4548.44s)]
*  And I think the answer is obviously no. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4549.72s)]
*  Well, so where does this stuff like all the weird original stuff they do on ESPN [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4551.48s)]
*  plus like some of the stuff Omaha does, like does that stuff, is that part of [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4555.72s)]
*  their plan or is it just going to be game rights and reaction shows and that's [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4561.08s)]
*  the future of the company? [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4564.4s)]
*  I think it's mostly that though. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4566.04s)]
*  I think they do like stars and since that's Manning stuff, maybe that gets [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4567.2s)]
*  grandfathered in to the plan, right? [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4571.04s)]
*  Cause if you're, if you're a star, then you get to do different things. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4573.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4577.12s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4578.32s)]
*  Um, on the, uh, on the Barkley being on ESPN next year piece of it, and [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4579.32s)]
*  just that show in general, look, who knows? [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4586.28s)]
*  It doesn't feel like it's going to go great. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4590.879999999999s)]
*  It's, it's just, it's like one of those when, uh, when Conan took over Jay [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4593.5199999999995s)]
*  Leno show and Jay Leno didn't want to leave. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4597.639999999999s)]
*  And there was just, even before it started, you're like, ah, this something [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4600.759999999999s)]
*  feels off. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4605.04s)]
*  I just, somebody delivering a show to ESPN that they're not in control of, [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4605.8s)]
*  which we're seeing now with McAfee, which I, I'm sure they, they have mixed [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4611.16s)]
*  opinions on, um, but just in Barkley who just doesn't give a shit anymore is the [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4615.280000000001s)]
*  other piece of this, right? [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4620.68s)]
*  And Kenny, I'm not sure he really cares. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4621.8s)]
*  Like they're just going to go and they're going to push and they're going [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4624.320000000001s)]
*  to tweak and they're going to do their thing. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4626.88s)]
*  It's, it really has a chance to be fascinating. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4628.280000000001s)]
*  I think, and I don't know how it plays out. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4631.76s)]
*  Well, I'm with Ryan. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4633.6s)]
*  I think the key is to also, will it just be able to roll into the night? [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4634.44s)]
*  Cause that's the magic of the show. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4638.96s)]
*  If it, if it doesn't roll into the night, it's not inside the NBA. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4640.44s)]
*  And the fact that it's on so late too, I think leads to the goofiness. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4645.12s)]
*  It's you've been there all day. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4649.44s)]
*  You've gone through the two games and then you're on those long stretches [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4652.08s)]
*  and that game, that, that whole post game is on so late. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4656.639999999999s)]
*  I think it actually is an advantage because it just gets so loose. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4659.639999999999s)]
*  Because it's almost like none of them want to be there, but you know, Bill, [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4663.719999999999s)]
*  I think you're right. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4666.639999999999s)]
*  Like Barkley has been, has been on this thing for a couple of years now. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4667.32s)]
*  Like I might do this. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4671.44s)]
*  I might do this. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4673.32s)]
*  I might quit. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4673.96s)]
*  They're going to shut down. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4674.679999999999s)]
*  And then you were kind of like, wait, are they not going to be on the air in 24, 25? [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4675.4s)]
*  And then you looked it up. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4678.96s)]
*  Nope. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4680.5199999999995s)]
*  They're still going to be on. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4680.839999999999s)]
*  So I'm like, why are they talking about it this way? [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4681.839999999999s)]
*  And then as soon as the transition is over, Barkley's, Barkley's going to make [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4683.759999999999s)]
*  fun of ESPN within 30 seconds of them going on the air. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4686.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4690.04s)]
*  And since it's going to be licensed or however, I don't know what the structure [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4690.799999999999s)]
*  is in comparison to some of the other stuff, Curtis, you would know better than [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4694.96s)]
*  I would is the understanding of just keep doing your own thing. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4696.92s)]
*  And that might be the ESPN model. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4701.4s)]
*  And if they're not really going to worry about it the way they would worry about [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4702.92s)]
*  a studio show in the past, because who could ever, who could ever on the TV [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4705.4s)]
*  side of ESPN show up to those guys and be like, love what you've been doing. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4708.799999999999s)]
*  Here are some tweaks. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4712.12s)]
*  Don't even like, I don't even know if anybody would bother doing something like that. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4715.5199999999995s)]
*  Around the horn going away, which leaves some sort of hole, which I guess there's [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4720.0s)]
*  been rumors about an hour long PTI, which I just feel like would happen over [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4725.44s)]
*  Kornheiser's dead body. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4730.679999999999s)]
*  I was going to say, my friend for a long time. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4732.12s)]
*  Does Tony want to do that? [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4733.96s)]
*  I just, he's there's, he's so maniacally precious about the format of that show [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4735.48s)]
*  and how sustainable it's been for this whole century to then just double it and [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4740.719999999999s)]
*  be like, all right, more of us and we're going to have an interview. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4745.5599999999995s)]
*  I just don't see him at his age wanting to do that. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4748.16s)]
*  Yeah, but didn't he write a book called I'm back for the cash. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4751.72s)]
*  Well, that's, he might have enough cash. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4755.24s)]
*  I think he has enough cash. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4758.44s)]
*  But I do wonder, I was thinking of PTI and there might be a chance to reinvent [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4760.04s)]
*  that show a little bit, because when you think, and I've talked a bunch about how [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4766.639999999999s)]
*  the content cycle has shifted in the last 15 years that I've been doing this, [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4770.04s)]
*  where it's just gotten faster and faster to the point that Sal and I went from [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4774.5199999999995s)]
*  taping Monday afternoons in the late two thousands guest Alliance to now we're [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4778.36s)]
*  doing it like literally right after an NBC game ends and you have these guys [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4783.0s)]
*  coming out at five 30 ESPN and it's like, if you don't watch that show when it's [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4787.16s)]
*  happening, it's got like maybe a two, three hour shelf life because we're going [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4792.919999999999s)]
*  running the sports. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4796.36s)]
*  So it's like Luca Donchich is first game back in LA. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4797.16s)]
*  First home game. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4801.2s)]
*  What do you think's going to happen tonight? [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4802.24s)]
*  Will Bond. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4803.48s)]
*  Like you can't listen to that nine hours later. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4804.0s)]
*  So I do wonder, is there a chance to reinvent the show? [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4806.5199999999995s)]
*  Do you think there it's just too stuck in its ways at this point, Curtis, [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4809.36s)]
*  or what happens? [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4813.12s)]
*  And you think reinvent it, like making it longer, making it different, making it [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4813.879999999999s)]
*  quicker reacts to something. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4817.32s)]
*  Do you rebuild it? [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4818.5599999999995s)]
*  Do you rebuild the structure? [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4819.44s)]
*  Cause I think if you were doing that show now, you'd probably want it to be on [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4822.16s)]
*  at 10 in the morning. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4826.5199999999995s)]
*  I think you would want it to be on coming off the night or nine in the morning. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4829.28s)]
*  You'd want it coming off the night before with the same format go, I think [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4832.44s)]
*  would be a bigger advantage. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4836.32s)]
*  I think the five thirties really hard. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4837.4s)]
*  I mean, have you thought about that? [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4839.759999999999s)]
*  We're still love. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4840.599999999999s)]
*  Like sometimes when we do pods late, I feel like it's like, this feels almost [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4842.2s)]
*  stale now when it's going to come out. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4847.44s)]
*  Think about what the six o'clock sports center was. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4850.04s)]
*  That was the marquee sports center. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4852.719999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4855.5599999999995s)]
*  I remember they used to offer it to Scott all the time and Scott would just say, [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4856.24s)]
*  I'm a games guy. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4859.36s)]
*  I'm a games guy. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4860.799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4861.599999999999s)]
*  I want to watch the games in the studio with the staff. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4862.0s)]
*  I want to figure out how we want to talk about the games. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4864.4400000000005s)]
*  Once the games are over, I don't want to do the six and they want him to do the [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4866.4800000000005s)]
*  six all the time and he was turning down what was thought at the time, like the [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4870.2s)]
*  marquee slot. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4873.68s)]
*  When's the last time you turned on the six o'clock sports center? [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4874.96s)]
*  It's pretty rare at that point. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4878.16s)]
*  You're thinking about the games that are about to happen. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4879.36s)]
*  I don't, I don't remember the last time. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4883.6s)]
*  Well, they're not already on obviously because it's six o'clock East coast, but [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4886.24s)]
*  I'm, I'm gearing up for the game. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4890.24s)]
*  It's three o'clock our time. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4891.6s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4892.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm waiting or I'm waiting until the last possible moment to turn on the TV, [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4892.72s)]
*  knowing that the TV is going to be on in my house for the next six hours. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4896.56s)]
*  Um, I think you're right about the Kornheiser, Wilbon thing being early [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4899.76s)]
*  wouldn't, would they want to do it? [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4903.68s)]
*  I also think a huge advantage they have over every other show is if they launch [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4905.400000000001s)]
*  that show brand new tomorrow, would it have any traction at all? [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4909.4800000000005s)]
*  Because it's almost like radio where it's so habit forming that there's such an [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4913.280000000001s)]
*  older generation of people that have been watching that show for 20 plus years. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4917.160000000001s)]
*  Cause I'll hear people talk about it. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4920.5199999999995s)]
*  Like, Hey, this is the only show I trust anymore. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4921.84s)]
*  This is the only thing like there's all of this equity with that show, this [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4924.32s)]
*  buy-in for the show where, and again, I'm the wrong person here, but when I catch [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4927.8s)]
*  it, there's never something where I go, Oh, I hadn't thought of that NBA angle. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4932.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4939.0s)]
*  Or, well, you're coming for the two guys. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4939.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4941.48s)]
*  It's because of their chemistry. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4941.8s)]
*  It's because of their personality, but like, I don't expect Kornheiser to say [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4943.16s)]
*  something about the Oklahoma city thunder that I never would have thought of. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4946.68s)]
*  Because I don't, I doubt he's staying up late watching thunder games. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4950.8s)]
*  So there's this buy-in with those two because of their personality, but also [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4954.360000000001s)]
*  the habit forming thing that you have with radio and that's what I think is, [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4958.4400000000005s)]
*  is so different about that show. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4962.56s)]
*  It's almost like this audio product that benefited from being in one of the best [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4963.92s)]
*  slots that you could have because it was lead into the six o'clock that used to [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4968.72s)]
*  matter and you know, Curtis knows this, but one of the biggest things with audio [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4971.400000000001s)]
*  is just habit. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4975.759999999999s)]
*  Why are you listening to that show? [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4977.879999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4979.08s)]
*  I just like it on in the background. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4979.48s)]
*  Oh, I throw it on in the car and then you might not even like the person. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4980.879999999999s)]
*  What do you think, Curtis? [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4986.32s)]
*  Like what is, what is PTI two years from now? [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4987.28s)]
*  Well, that's the thing is I think when, when we talk about ESPN as a streaming [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4990.08s)]
*  service, rather than a cable channel, just the entire calculus is different [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4993.24s)]
*  because you're no longer thinking about, Hey, we got to get from five to five [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=4997.4s)]
*  30, then we got to have another ride home show from five 30 to six. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5000.5599999999995s)]
*  Like that, that thinking isn't the same, right? [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5004.24s)]
*  If you were watching television at five or five 30 in the afternoon and you're [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5006.96s)]
*  choosing through a bunch of streaming options, you can watch 10,000 movies. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5011.44s)]
*  You can watch white lotus, you can watch whatever the hell you want. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5014.72s)]
*  So my prediction would be, look, if they get Tony Mike to do an hour, I'm sure [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5018.24s)]
*  they'd love that because that shows grandfather day and that shows a hit on [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5022.28s)]
*  its own rights, but what I would think they're going to do with a whole daytime [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5024.96s)]
*  lineup is just other than the things we talked about, let's just go inexpensive. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5028.04s)]
*  Let's get through the day because our big wins in streaming will be games [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5032.639999999999s)]
*  and stuff attached to games. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5036.799999999999s)]
*  And that's that, that's, that's the business. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5038.959999999999s)]
*  I just think that's what it is. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5041.0s)]
*  And I think the whole daytime part of ESPN gets devalued. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5042.08s)]
*  I had a lot of, sorry, I actually just want to ask her like people in my position [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5045.5599999999995s)]
*  can get really entitled about this stuff. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5051.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5053.879999999999s)]
*  I'm never going to work there again, but just that all of these landing [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5054.5199999999995s)]
*  spots exist for different people. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5058.4s)]
*  And you're like, how can they get rid of this? [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5061.0s)]
*  How can they get rid of all these shows? [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5062.5199999999995s)]
*  How are you getting rid of around the horn? [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5064.04s)]
*  You know, why wouldn't they have done this? [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5065.839999999999s)]
*  Why wouldn't they have? [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5067.08s)]
*  Do you think ESPN ultimately got to the point? [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5067.919999999999s)]
*  It was like, okay, first take, we get a half a million viewers. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5069.759999999999s)]
*  We actually kind of own this slot here. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5071.759999999999s)]
*  There's not, there's like, there's a ton of competition mid day in sports [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5073.32s)]
*  from anybody else. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5076.639999999999s)]
*  Um, obviously Fox tried to do that at some point that hasn't worked out. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5077.639999999999s)]
*  Do you think the right answer, even though on air people would never want to [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5081.879999999999s)]
*  hear it, is that why do you have all of these resources into a bunch of shows [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5084.719999999999s)]
*  that for the most part? [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5088.879999999999s)]
*  Like there's not, not that many of these shows are like killing it with the [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5090.88s)]
*  ratings. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5094.16s)]
*  I just run video podcasts of stuff you already did. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5095.04s)]
*  Just, just kind of chew up innings with that and save a ton of money. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5098.96s)]
*  It is an interesting question. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5102.4400000000005s)]
*  It wouldn't be the first time it's happened in the history of cable. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5103.52s)]
*  I mean, that's when I was a kid. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5105.72s)]
*  That was all cables like, Oh, press your luck reruns on for the next four hours. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5107.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5111.04s)]
*  I mean, and I think Ryan, I think you're exactly right. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5111.2s)]
*  And I think the it's, but it's all of television, right? [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5114.04s)]
*  We're just so used to this thing of like, Oh, it's mid morning. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5116.24s)]
*  That means there's game shows and then there's these, you know, soap operas [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5118.32s)]
*  are going to start all these things. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5121.28s)]
*  And I just think when the future is streaming, you know, it's not happy if [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5122.5599999999995s)]
*  it's our friends that are affected by our people we like, but it's like, they [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5126.48s)]
*  just don't, it's just not that important to them anymore. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5129.84s)]
*  It's so clear. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5133.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, like what we know this, right? [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5134.48s)]
*  They're not like, Hey, we're losing a daytime hit show. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5136.48s)]
*  Let's come up with another one. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5139.32s)]
*  Let's get ride home industries to come up with another one or a plate. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5141.12s)]
*  They're just not thinking that way anymore. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5143.679999999999s)]
*  I had a great TV viewing experience the other day. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5145.8s)]
*  Although it was a sad one too, but, um, the Bruins are trading Marshan and there [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5148.6s)]
*  were rumors like he might be going. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5153.56s)]
*  And my dad texted me, I'm like, what? [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5155.96s)]
*  So I'm trying to find like, is there an NHL trade deadline show? [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5159.12s)]
*  What's going on here? [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5163.24s)]
*  Ended up on the NHL network. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5165.44s)]
*  It was just two dudes. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5167.2s)]
*  The show is out of like 1981 and they're going through info and it's this thing [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5168.6s)]
*  is happening and I was watching it consuming in a way. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5174.92s)]
*  And I, like, that's, that's where those shows still have an impact. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5177.4400000000005s)]
*  Where it's like, this just happened. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5181.96s)]
*  How do I get information about it? [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5183.84s)]
*  You know, you'll see it like NBA trade deadlines like that, or like the, the, [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5185.4800000000005s)]
*  the day of free agency in the NBA on July 1st, um, or NFL, something happens on a [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5189.8s)]
*  Tuesday, you know, there's a trade or somebody's out for the year. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5196.56s)]
*  It seems like the immediacy of this just happened. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5200.72s)]
*  How do I just get any sort of information? [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5202.84s)]
*  I don't even care. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5205.0s)]
*  I honestly don't know the names of the two guys who hosted this NHL show, but I [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5205.84s)]
*  watched it for like 45 minutes. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5209.6s)]
*  Like they did, they didn't. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5211.2s)]
*  It's a, it's a conditional second. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5213.28s)]
*  What's going on? [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5215.4800000000005s)]
*  Um, yeah, that's my NHL network story. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5216.84s)]
*  Brasilla seems like he's enjoying it. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5219.28s)]
*  I used to watch the MLB trade deadline stuff. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5221.76s)]
*  Like I had a job in a front office. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5225.24s)]
*  I would, I worked at night, so I wasn't really taking a day off or disrupting my [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5228.24s)]
*  normal routine, but I would sit there with a notepad and I would have my scouting [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5233.88s)]
*  books that I bought from borders and I have baseball America ready to go. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5237.4s)]
*  And I would just sit there being like, Oh my God, that's that lefty who, you [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5241.5199999999995s)]
*  know, he was incredible against the cardinals gave him up. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5244.5199999999995s)]
*  He was their number one prospect. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5247.12s)]
*  Did you see his splits at Chattanooga? [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5248.5599999999995s)]
*  This is incredible. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5250.4s)]
*  I loved those shows and I love that you had a moment where you got to feel it in [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5252.08s)]
*  real time, but I just wonder if anybody's going to that anymore, if they're thinking [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5258.2s)]
*  I need to throw on a studio show. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5262.36s)]
*  Like I still love the NBA trade deadline stuff because it's my every day, but I [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5264.12s)]
*  don't, I don't know if I would go to it with the same anticipation. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5269.32s)]
*  And look, it's funny. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5272.679999999999s)]
*  Gammon's could make up shit 25 years ago and I was entertained. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5274.2s)]
*  I was all in. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5278.639999999999s)]
*  I'm like, you know, we've already talked about my attraction to diamond [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5279.719999999999s)]
*  notes in the past, but I just wonder if it moves too fast now where the value of [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5282.4s)]
*  the woge stuff and the sham stuff was making sure you had their Twitter feed. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5288.4s)]
*  Like, I wonder if Elon, although Elon's been busy, should he actually suspend [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5291.759999999999s)]
*  insider's accounts that are only reporting breaking news a minute after [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5296.16s)]
*  somebody else has, because I've noticed a lot of that, is it worth it just to [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5300.0s)]
*  stay in the game to be like, I didn't break this fuck sources. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5303.36s)]
*  Confirm. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5309.16s)]
*  And then like, is that replaced the immediacy, the need, you know, it would be [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5310.92s)]
*  great. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5316.48s)]
*  It'd be great if there were three or four people out there that I felt like I [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5316.8s)]
*  trusted to put the work in, maybe a Zach Lowe, obviously a wind horse with all of [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5319.599999999999s)]
*  his sources, somebody that's good at both the information and being good in a [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5323.84s)]
*  studio and stuff like I still love that stuff. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5327.88s)]
*  And I would watch that stuff. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5330.88s)]
*  I'm not taping with you during the trade deadline, but I always have to ask [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5331.8s)]
*  myself, like, are you one of the only people that still want something like [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5335.88s)]
*  that? Like your joy for an NHL trading deadline studio show? [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5339.28s)]
*  Are you the asshole? [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5344.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5346.12s)]
*  There were trades and I, there is like a five person trade and I didn't know who [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5347.4800000000005s)]
*  any of the five people were. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5351.12s)]
*  And I'm like, Oh, surprised they did that. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5352.28s)]
*  Like I feel you had to have opinions on that stuff. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5355.72s)]
*  I think that's still the magic of TV is when you can just go live with stuff like [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5358.32s)]
*  that. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5361.92s)]
*  I mean, that, that, I mean, I'm, I'm the same way. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5362.12s)]
*  So when we, because I've thought about that with podcasting and radio, like I [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5364.16s)]
*  did some interview where I didn't, I thought, well, you know, look, the [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5367.8s)]
*  Luca trades, perfect example, Luca trade happens. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5372.08s)]
*  Bill and I are with Mahoney 10 minutes later. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5374.2s)]
*  So we're replacing the live part of it. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5376.96s)]
*  But I do wonder if there's, and I think I'm wrong. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5380.96s)]
*  I think I'm wrong to wonder if there's ever a moment moving forward where people [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5384.84s)]
*  go, you know, what I kind of miss is just knowing the show was live and they were [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5388.44s)]
*  acting in the moment. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5392.24s)]
*  Cause I think it's all replaced. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5393.04s)]
*  Curtis would like this story though. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5394.599999999999s)]
*  So I'm a kid. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5396.96s)]
*  I'm staying at my mom's house in Connecticut and I don't think it was the [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5398.2s)]
*  fan. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5403.04s)]
*  It was even a New York sports station that wasn't a fan. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5403.5599999999995s)]
*  And Dave Sims was hosting like a NBA giraffe show. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5406.92s)]
*  And you remember being a kid in the eighties, there's just no information. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5411.04s)]
*  You don't know any, you might be like sports illustrated might have like, here's, [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5415.2s)]
*  how we think the top 13 and the draft is going to be like, Oh my God. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5420.44s)]
*  Like there was just nothing. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5423.72s)]
*  You couldn't find anything about anything. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5424.8s)]
*  And there was this radio show and they just did the draft for like three, [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5427.16s)]
*  four hours. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5431.4s)]
*  And I, I, like you could have a bulldozer could have driven through my [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5432.2s)]
*  house and I just want to like move rooms because I just wanted to hear the show [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5437.28s)]
*  so bad. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5440.88s)]
*  And I do wonder like that, that sensation has to be gone these days, right? [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5441.76s)]
*  Curtis, there's no, there's no show like that anymore. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5445.16s)]
*  No, I mean, I do. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5448.28s)]
*  I do think the Lucas such an extreme example, but that night, I mean, first of [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5449.64s)]
*  all, when I saw that you guys were taping, I was like, here we go. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5453.04s)]
*  I'm ready. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5455.280000000001s)]
*  I'm excited about that. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5456.120000000001s)]
*  But then when I saw that the wind horse had gotten on ESPN and they like kind of [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5457.320000000001s)]
*  bro called him onto the network, onto the air and got him in a suit, like someone [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5461.360000000001s)]
*  had just died, you know, like it was like, this is big, you know, Brian's awake. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5465.4400000000005s)]
*  Brian's in a suit. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5469.92s)]
*  Brian's ready to go. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5470.88s)]
*  Like that was like, as a viewer, I'm like, this is exciting. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5472.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, this makes me feel like, Holy shit, something amazing has just happened. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5475.400000000001s)]
*  Do you think when horses like fuck, man, I was going to play golf tomorrow. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5479.44s)]
*  Now, now I'm at a connecting flight to Hartford because they, they need me to [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5483.68s)]
*  get in there, but see, like that's, I like that you brought up the wind horse thing. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5489.0s)]
*  Cause at that point you're thinking, all right, who could actually be on TV that I [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5492.68s)]
*  would want to hear from, okay. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5496.5199999999995s)]
*  That I know is going to have something that I don't know. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5498.6s)]
*  Not that you or I are at the same level of reporters or whatever, but I think [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5500.84s)]
*  we're probably pretty good on it. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5504.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5505.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5505.96s)]
*  If Luca gets traded, you and I are going to be able to hang for a [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5506.24s)]
*  now. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5509.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5509.4s)]
*  The beauty of a wind horse, which seems to be where all of this is moving away [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5511.76s)]
*  from is that I know in those few minutes he's going to kill it and he's going to [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5516.5199999999995s)]
*  have something the rest of us don't have. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5522.36s)]
*  And he also had that rant during the playoffs last year, which he also said [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5524.8s)]
*  after he did the rant, nobody actually came to him to be like, Hey, you're [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5530.8s)]
*  taking, you would have thought somebody would have gone, Hey, leave our guy [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5533.96s)]
*  alone, even if wind horse was right. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5536.68s)]
*  Not what you was. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5539.32s)]
*  And so wind horse had all of these awesome moments in that spot that I fear [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5540.76s)]
*  we're going to lose forever. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5547.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5549.68s)]
*  That's that old school TV authority too. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5549.92s)]
*  I think like I'm paying attention to you. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5551.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5554.16s)]
*  You know, you know stuff and you're also just have a kind of presence on the air. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5554.4s)]
*  You know, which from when horse comes, I think from being in print a little bit [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5559.52s)]
*  and seeming like kind of a reluctant second go bear TV guy. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5562.6s)]
*  The go bear move for him was like all time, like his approval rating would he. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5566.200000000001s)]
*  After that, it was like, everybody's like, I love this guy. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5572.4800000000005s)]
*  I got to say the, the Luca thing he did at when the Celts went up three [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5575.72s)]
*  Oh in the finals. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5579.160000000001s)]
*  Cause I actually watched that. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5579.96s)]
*  Cause I was watching when I, after Luca got traded, I'm just like consuming [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5581.04s)]
*  everything, trying to figure out what could have happened. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5584.0s)]
*  And it was like a pre-planned monologue in his head. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5587.120000000001s)]
*  He's doing it stand up on the court. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5589.8s)]
*  He clearly had something to say. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5592.24s)]
*  He also clearly had information from somebody in the Dallas side that colored [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5593.719999999999s)]
*  why he was doing this and he was really convicted about it. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5597.959999999999s)]
*  And he, and he was like, this is a real problem for this team that this guy is [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5601.32s)]
*  handling big games and big moments like this. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5605.28s)]
*  He hurt the team today. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5607.48s)]
*  He's got to fix this. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5608.799999999999s)]
*  And now when you look back at that, I haven't talked to him about it, but. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5610.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, that was probably the genesis of when that trade happened, that finals. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5614.36s)]
*  Where we still think it's the dumbest NBA trade of our lifetimes, but that was [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5618.96s)]
*  probably where they were like, this fucking guy and, and it just, that was it. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5623.88s)]
*  And they just start complaining about him and complaining about it behind [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5630.6s)]
*  the scenes and that's it. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5633.04s)]
*  But yeah, people are, there's still good journalism out there. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5634.04s)]
*  And I also feel like the bar of, um, people kind of policing it. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5637.24s)]
*  It's been really good. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5642.8s)]
*  I think people are getting away with a lot less chicanery and putting out false shit. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5644.56s)]
*  Nobody wants to be wrong. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5649.280000000001s)]
*  I think people are really careful about when they put something out and [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5650.4400000000005s)]
*  occasionally we get a fight at a Starbucks at the combine. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5653.92s)]
*  We're from Howard Schultz's son. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5657.4800000000005s)]
*  Did you lead the press box with that? [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5659.88s)]
*  Or was that just a deep dive investigation after the fact? [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5661.56s)]
*  That was almost my, you know, wind horse, Luca trade moment. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5664.64s)]
*  I almost had to go live. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5667.360000000001s)]
*  Do I have a suit? [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5668.96s)]
*  I don't, Rusella, have you done the combine? [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5670.64s)]
*  Have I ever gone to it? [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5674.28s)]
*  You've done it right now. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5675.16s)]
*  No, he never did it. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5676.400000000001s)]
*  Ever. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5678.28s)]
*  McShay was trying to get me to go and do it like kind of before. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5678.88s)]
*  I think he had done his own thing. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5683.72s)]
*  I think last year he'd asked me, Hey, do you have any interest? [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5685.72s)]
*  But it just, it hits at a really bad time. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5688.4400000000005s)]
*  Like it's just when the basketball pranks up, I'm pretty sick of [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5690.4400000000005s)]
*  football at that point. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5693.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5694.88s)]
*  And so I think from decompress. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5695.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5696.92s)]
*  To decompress. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5697.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5698.4s)]
*  I think from a networking standpoint, it's really great. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5698.639999999999s)]
*  If you have anything going on in the media, because everybody's just kind of around, [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5701.4s)]
*  you're going to make it a lot of contacts and everything, but, uh, I don't know, man. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5704.639999999999s)]
*  I can get a little selfish about my schedule. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5708.88s)]
*  I, uh, I haven't really talked to you about this, but, um, McShay and I [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5711.44s)]
*  text a little bit now. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5715.36s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5717.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5718.44s)]
*  I'll just sometimes text him football stuff and then he'll text me back. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5719.679999999999s)]
*  That's pretty cool. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5723.799999999999s)]
*  I put Bill on a thread with my college roommate, which is incredible. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5724.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5728.0s)]
*  I'm on a, I'm, I'm on a thread with Silla's roommate and conspiracy [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5728.24s)]
*  theorist extraordinaire, Timmy. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5732.96s)]
*  And, uh, and Bill, Bill, my favorite threads. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5736.799999999999s)]
*  Every time he, every time there's the text, I'm excited about it. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5740.759999999999s)]
*  It's great. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5743.759999999999s)]
*  Cause the Boston guys, cause he's not from Boston, but the Boston guys are like, [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5744.5599999999995s)]
*  Bill's on a thread with you and Walsh. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5748.24s)]
*  I went, yeah. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5750.2s)]
*  Like, how did that happen? [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5751.599999999999s)]
*  I go, yeah, it's, it's rarefied rarefied air with all this stuff. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5752.56s)]
*  It started with a UFO conversation in Denver and then we just kept going. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5755.8s)]
*  Hey, welcome to a special part of the show, which is brought to you today by [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5759.52s)]
*  Audi with their all new fully electric Audi Q6 e-tron wanted to do. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5763.240000000001s)]
*  This isn't like, we're not going to do like a recap of Celtic city each episode, [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5768.52s)]
*  but I want to do like one little piece from each episode that I thought we [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5772.56s)]
*  could talk about in a modern context. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5777.04s)]
*  So the first episode, a lot of it's about Bob Cousy, who I feel like has [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5778.76s)]
*  this fascinating big picture, whatever he means in the context of American [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5783.400000000001s)]
*  sports in the 21st century, it's either underrated or overrated, but it's not. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5790.360000000001s)]
*  What I think people think like that. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5795.16s)]
*  You could, he's the most popular player of the first 15 years of the league. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5797.04s)]
*  He was the first exciting player of the league ever had. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5800.96s)]
*  And he actually should be discussed maybe a little more reverentially than he is. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5804.16s)]
*  And instead the only time he's been discussed this decade was JJ when he did [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5808.16s)]
*  the plumbers, that whole plumbers thing that he did when he kind of disparaged [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5812.48s)]
*  the first 15 years of league and people got upset about that, but, um, Curtis, [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5816.0s)]
*  just as a sports historian, Bob Cousy, big picture, what are your, what are [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5821.12s)]
*  your like immediate thoughts? [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5826.68s)]
*  Um, I'm a guy who primarily is venerated. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5828.48s)]
*  I don't know if properly or maybe venerated at all in Boston newspapers right now. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5834.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, I feel he is lost. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5840.68s)]
*  I feel he's the guy that, you know, gets the globe column every once in a while. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5842.360000000001s)]
*  Bob Cousy is still alive, but he's still proud to be a Celtic. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5846.360000000001s)]
*  It gets a couple of things like, yeah, right. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5849.16s)]
*  I mean, I'm just trying to think of where he lands in culture, pre-documentary, [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5851.0s)]
*  not that many places. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5856.08s)]
*  It's interesting to look at the anniversary teams because they would do, they did like [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5857.8s)]
*  a 25th anniversary team for the NBA in like 1971 and Cousy was, you know, clearly [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5862.72s)]
*  on that he's one of the 10 guys. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5869.04s)]
*  And then you do, you know, the 40th anniversary, he's still there and the [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5870.6s)]
*  50th anniversary and then, but this just says the years pass, you just start [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5874.280000000001s)]
*  getting shoved out right for the newer guys or the legends. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5878.4400000000005s)]
*  Um, and the thing with him, the, the, there's all these different time [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5882.6s)]
*  machine guys that would be so much fun if you could just take them out and [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5886.96s)]
*  put them in a different era. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5890.400000000001s)]
*  Like you could take, I don't know, Jason Tatum right now and put him in 1955 and [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5891.52s)]
*  people would be like, what's happening? [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5898.56s)]
*  Um, Cousy would be fun in the reverse. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5900.8s)]
*  Like if he just came into the way Leakes played Howard, it's just like, he's just [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5903.240000000001s)]
*  going nuts, throwing like these behind the back, crazy passes. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5907.4400000000005s)]
*  He's always trying to do fast breaks. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5910.360000000001s)]
*  How does this play out? [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5912.280000000001s)]
*  Rossella? [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5913.160000000001s)]
*  He probably struggled a little bit. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5915.040000000001s)]
*  I think if you just dropped him in a time machine, they'd play off them. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5916.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5919.88s)]
*  I think they play, they go under the screens 33% first career from the floor. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5920.12s)]
*  But I don't know if it's because of the Holy cross thing, because of my family. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5925.599999999999s)]
*  Like, obviously you went to Holy cross, but there was, there was a version of [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5931.36s)]
*  events where I was going to go there. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5934.28s)]
*  My family and my father's side loves Holy cross. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5935.5599999999995s)]
*  So there's just this absolute admiration for Cousy. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5937.84s)]
*  Um, yeah, it's just, you know, there was, this wasn't a bad word spoken about [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5942.88s)]
*  Bob Cousy, my entire upbringing. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5948.32s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5950.599999999999s)]
*  And so then once you get internet access and you start digging through it, you're [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5950.88s)]
*  like, what the fuck is this? [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5953.88s)]
*  Um, but I, that's where I think this becomes a real mistake. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5955.92s)]
*  His rookie year was 75 fucking years ago. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5958.5199999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5960.679999999999s)]
*  So like the game was a little different. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5961.36s)]
*  Uh, they ran up and down, they shot it immediately. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5964.08s)]
*  And he was the best point guard of his generation for a really long time. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5967.679999999999s)]
*  Like, you know, if you want to get into the Oscar Robertson stats thing and all [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5972.16s)]
*  that kind of stuff, and yes, the team was always better and, you know, there was [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5974.599999999999s)]
*  just a different element of what sports were back then because they were able to [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5977.76s)]
*  keep the team together and red was just better than everybody else. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5981.400000000001s)]
*  I just, I think it's entirely unfair to look at his shooting splits and the fact [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5983.72s)]
*  that he dribbled with one hand and then dump all over the guy when his rookie [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5988.24s)]
*  year was 1950, 51, I mean, can we, can we, is that okay? [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5992.16s)]
*  Well, have you ever talked Cousy's talked about this when you dribbled back then [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5995.88s)]
*  you, you couldn't carry the ball. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=5999.4800000000005s)]
*  You couldn't carry it under. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6001.360000000001s)]
*  You had to literally dribble like that. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6003.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6006.4800000000005s)]
*  And you're playing in these shitty sneakers. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6006.96s)]
*  It's not, it's like night and day. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6008.68s)]
*  It's like comparing automobiles from the 1950s to now. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6010.16s)]
*  I think the passing, the highlights are still really fun. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6014.08s)]
*  Like we had a bunch of them in the first episode, the behind the head, the way he [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6016.84s)]
*  would like bring guys in and, you know, everybody was, everybody was in play when [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6020.68s)]
*  he was the point guard. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6025.92s)]
*  I do miss, like, I feel like that type of point guard is, doesn't really exist [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6027.12s)]
*  anymore, right? [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6031.84s)]
*  You're almost like a score slash distributor. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6033.360000000001s)]
*  Now you're more like a Darius Garland type. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6036.4s)]
*  There's not, Rondo is probably maybe the last kind of piece of whatever Cousy was [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6038.8s)]
*  way, way back then the way Rondo played, I think was, I don't know if we'll see [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6045.24s)]
*  it again. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6049.28s)]
*  Will we see it again, Rossella? [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6049.8s)]
*  I just don't know that you can survive having somebody that's, you can just [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6051.56s)]
*  ignore, you know, whether it's, whether it's a big, I mean, you can have a non [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6055.68s)]
*  shooting center, but it puts you at a disadvantage. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6059.48s)]
*  You could have a non shooting point guard, but it just puts you at a disadvantage. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6062.24s)]
*  So I think just looking for shooting at all five positions the entire time. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6065.12s)]
*  You know, Rondo at his best was, was terrific, but he still was thinking, you [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6068.36s)]
*  know, kind of under the screen. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6073.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6075.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6076.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6076.84s)]
*  I also thought there was something with Rondo that, that took away, I don't know. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6077.32s)]
*  I didn't want to turn this into a Rondo criticism, but when he would scream for [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6080.8s)]
*  the outlet every single time, I think there were times where it was like, he [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6083.24s)]
*  wanted to be in charge of the possession. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6086.12s)]
*  He used to drive some of the other guys crazy. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6087.32s)]
*  He was like the guy who always wanted to drive on the cross-country trip. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6089.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's fine. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6093.08s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6093.76s)]
*  You could drive. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6094.12s)]
*  I'll be back here studying. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6095.28s)]
*  Uh, I, I don't know. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6096.68s)]
*  I think the Cousy, I think guys that get really nasty about Cousy. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6098.599999999999s)]
*  I just want to be like, can you pick something else to be upset about? [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6104.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6107.4s)]
*  Curtis in the eighties, it was Cousy and Heintzen with Mike Gorman. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6108.599999999999s)]
*  Cousy was the third guy, a bunch. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6116.24s)]
*  Wow. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6118.2s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6118.72s)]
*  And it's still like up there for my favorite announcing teams of all time. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6119.64s)]
*  Cause Cousy and Heintzen had this, you know, amazing relationship where they [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6122.72s)]
*  over, I think they overlapped for one year at Holy Cross. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6127.08s)]
*  They played together for, oh no, they didn't overlap at Holy Cross, but they [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6129.280000000001s)]
*  both went to Holy Cross and then they played together with the Celtics, I [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6133.6s)]
*  think for seven years, so they just, there was this real friendship with them. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6136.8s)]
*  And they were also like pretty critical of, of, you know, their data combined, [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6141.360000000001s)]
*  like 15 rings, so they would be critical of the players they were watching. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6145.4800000000005s)]
*  And it was just like hanging out. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6149.16s)]
*  It was like a podcast. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6150.64s)]
*  It was, it was amazing. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6151.6s)]
*  Cousy had that, there were just names he couldn't say cause he had that crazy [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6153.160000000001s)]
*  French accent, like he, Rajon Rondo just would have been unachievable for Cousy. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6156.88s)]
*  There's no way he was even going near it. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6161.6s)]
*  But, uh, I was thinking about that though, when, when I was, you know, look, cause [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6163.360000000001s)]
*  he was just such a legend from the area that we're from. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6167.84s)]
*  So maybe people aren't really understanding it, but when they used to be on the [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6169.92s)]
*  broadcast, they would kill players. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6174.08s)]
*  Okay. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6177.64s)]
*  Kill them. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6178.240000000001s)]
*  Kill players. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6178.72s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6179.08s)]
*  Could not care less. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6179.320000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6180.360000000001s)]
*  And if there was an opposing guy that stunk and had a big, I remember there [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6180.8s)]
*  was this guy for the nets who like went for 30 or something against the Celtics. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6184.0s)]
*  And Cousy would just be like, I've never seen this, you know, he, I can't even do [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6187.52s)]
*  the accent it's so, it's so tough, but it was just like, this guy's never [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6191.320000000001s)]
*  done anything his whole life. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6194.280000000001s)]
*  Like, what is this? [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6195.56s)]
*  And it was kind of funny, like coming off of last week about the [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6196.8s)]
*  positive negative stuff of it. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6199.320000000001s)]
*  There is no broadcast. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6201.56s)]
*  You could talk studio shows and. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6203.12s)]
*  You know, whatever we saw from first take at different times and the, in the [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6205.96s)]
*  nastiness that he can get to and be like, Oh, how different is this from other times? [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6209.08s)]
*  The broadcasts. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6212.6s)]
*  You are not going to hear anyone criticized in an NBA broadcast, especially [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6214.5599999999995s)]
*  a national broadcast, but even the home broadcast are just so positive about the [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6218.64s)]
*  home team, they don't really have that much time to even be negative. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6222.0s)]
*  I mean, look, the fouls, it's all Homer's and we get it back then. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6224.5199999999995s)]
*  They would just destroy, like it almost, you'd look forward to a Cousy game [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6229.48s)]
*  because it was going to be so unhinged and funny, especially when the team is bad. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6233.64s)]
*  Well, Curtis, you remember Bill Walton when he did the NBC in the mid nineties [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6237.72s)]
*  was considered so negative. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6244.2s)]
*  I think they had to take them off. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6245.52s)]
*  I think it actually like, he, he was like too critical because it's another thing. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6247.320000000001s)]
*  Like Bill Walton was one of the best 30 players, 35 players of all time. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6251.280000000001s)]
*  So he would watch somebody suck and he would just call it out. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6255.56s)]
*  And I think it got too negative even for a NBA coverage. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6258.96s)]
*  You remember that? [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6262.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6263.2s)]
*  Well, he was killing the players on the court and he was killing Steve snapper [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6263.56s)]
*  Jones in the seat next to him at the same time. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6266.36s)]
*  He's killing everybody. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6268.16s)]
*  It's funny because he's such a happy, joyous guy. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6269.88s)]
*  It just was a thing. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6272.04s)]
*  Anyway, the all new fully electric Audi Q6 e-tron, a huge leap forward, [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6273.4s)]

*  Curtis, iPad, just nothing. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6291.32s)]
*  Look out the window. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6294.16s)]

*  Do not drive while distracted before you go, Curtis. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6316.160000000001s)]
*  Can I sneak a Bill Walton memory in here too? [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6319.360000000001s)]
*  Please do it now. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6321.360000000001s)]
*  All right. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6322.759999999999s)]
*  So Steve Snapper Jones is talking about Shaq's foul shooting. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6323.08s)]
*  Pretty sure this is during the finals, maybe the conference finals. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6326.16s)]
*  Shaq goes up to the line, makes one. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6328.919999999999s)]
*  And Walton just in the broadcast goes, I believe that's called face. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6331.44s)]
*  And then I'm pretty sure if I'm remembering this right, Shaq makes another free throw. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6337.04s)]
*  He actually goes two for two and he goes, I believe that's also called face. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6340.679999999999s)]
*  Just right in the middle of the broadcast. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6344.16s)]
*  Huge NBA game. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6345.799999999999s)]
*  But he was just too weird. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6348.5599999999995s)]
*  Ultimately, I think Pac-12 was probably the right landing spot. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6350.36s)]
*  People misremembered that later. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6355.04s)]
*  They're like, he was amazing wearing an Uncle Sam suit. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6356.32s)]
*  Like, yeah, that wasn't great during the NBA finals. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6358.5199999999995s)]
*  So I think the Walton stuff though, was just the theatrics of it. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6361.2s)]
*  That maybe didn't play as well on a weekend afternoon where I just remember [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6365.839999999999s)]
*  there would be like a turnover and be like, that's gonna be the worst. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6371.44s)]
*  That's terrible. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6375.28s)]
*  The worst pass of Poo Richardson's career. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6376.56s)]
*  Poo Richardson. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6381.64s)]
*  He used to be like, I don't know, it's 67, 64. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6382.76s)]
*  A lot of time left in this one. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6385.56s)]
*  So ESPN premiered their three man lineup after the All-Star, or three [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6388.4400000000005s)]
*  broadcaster lineup, Doris, Richard Jefferson and Breen. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6392.96s)]
*  NBC announced that they're signing Reggie Miller to be the person next year. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6396.72s)]
*  And it's just weird to me. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6401.96s)]
*  It seems like in the NBA for whatever reason, and maybe it's cause they make [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6403.76s)]
*  too much money as players and they just, the studio gig is easier. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6408.320000000001s)]
*  You get to whatever you want, but it seems like the big names kind of [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6411.76s)]
*  gravitate to the studios and not the games. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6415.360000000001s)]
*  Will we ever have a great game broadcaster again, Curtis? [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6419.4800000000005s)]
*  Have we, how many have we had yet? [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6423.24s)]
*  You know, nationally, I mean, you and I always have this conversations. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6425.2s)]
*  Like who's the John Madden in the NBA and you can pick guys, you know, you can pick [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6427.84s)]
*  a hubby, you can pick Van Gundy had a good run, right? [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6431.36s)]
*  But it was just like, there wasn't that guy ever really. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6434.88s)]
*  And it's funny if it were the NFL, somebody the other day was like, should [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6438.92s)]
*  they had Tom Brady, the Fox studios? [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6441.839999999999s)]
*  Like they're not Tom Brady in the studio. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6443.5199999999995s)]
*  It's like, you're doing games. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6446.04s)]
*  Need him for the thing you do. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6446.96s)]
*  We need you to do the games. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6448.36s)]
*  And I don't know if it's just the thankless job because you don't get as much [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6450.28s)]
*  time to talk as an NFL announcer or what, but yeah, it's funny. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6452.5599999999995s)]
*  What do you think, Rossello? [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6457.04s)]
*  Cause you love Van Gundy and I still, I, [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6458.88s)]
*  I went like, I'd probably was too down on being Gundy because I didn't really [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6461.2s)]
*  think about what it was going to be like when we didn't have them and I really [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6465.8s)]
*  missed them in a game like last night. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6469.36s)]
*  I just think Van Gundy was the best to have done it, um, on the NBA. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6472.96s)]
*  And I thought there was a huge gap after him because even, you know, even [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6478.32s)]
*  when no matter what was happening, you know, people got like really annoyed [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6483.32s)]
*  with the brain Mark Jackson being Gundy thing, cause people were like, oh, it's [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6485.5599999999995s)]
*  like a podcast or whatever, but sometimes within the game, it's okay [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6488.4s)]
*  to stay with a talking point. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6492.759999999999s)]
*  And you know, the real chemistry is knowing when Breen needs the room to do [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6494.719999999999s)]
*  play by play to get you through the stuff that matters, but then finding a way to [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6498.599999999999s)]
*  circle back to the talking point. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6503.679999999999s)]
*  And then if you've got to blow out with that group, then, you know, again, it [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6505.839999999999s)]
*  turned into, oh, they're doing a podcast again. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6509.5599999999995s)]
*  Um, and maybe it was a little too negative on the NBA stuff, but at least [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6512.12s)]
*  I felt like it was authentic. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6516.48s)]
*  And then Van Gundy would have a moment that he would pick up that nobody else [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6518.24s)]
*  would pick up. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6520.919999999999s)]
*  He would, he would just pick up these little things that was happening within [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6521.679999999999s)]
*  the game. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6524.679999999999s)]
*  It just meant that he knew every little detail of why is this guy, why is he [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6524.959999999999s)]
*  coming in here, his sub here? [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6528.28s)]
*  Like Van Gundy would give you a couple of those moments that I just don't know [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6529.879999999999s)]
*  that anybody else has given you enough consistently. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6532.599999999999s)]
*  I really like Richard. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6535.16s)]
*  I know it's tough because he's coming into an already established thing with [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6536.799999999999s)]
*  Doris and Breen, but, um, I dunno, I think they'll be fine. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6540.0s)]
*  I re I really do. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6544.24s)]
*  Three persons hard. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6545.48s)]
*  I know three persons. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6547.28s)]
*  I don't think there's enough time in basketball for the three people. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6548.04s)]
*  And even like the Breen Van Gundy Jackson, Jackson really laid out. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6551.16s)]
*  I mean, Jackson was, um, I dunno, it was Van Gundy's broadcast and then Jackson [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6554.639999999999s)]
*  would chime in with stuff, but that the, the balance, the usage rate Jackson was [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6561.639999999999s)]
*  lower. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6566.639999999999s)]
*  I didn't think it's a hard thing to navigate because those games that goes by [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6567.2s)]
*  so fast, you'll have like a five, six minutes stretch that it's just, it's [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6570.04s)]
*  going, going, going, going. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6573.4s)]
*  I thought Steve Kerr was the best one that I'd heard. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6574.84s)]
*  Um, there was even a moment this year when I was thinking when it seemed like [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6578.160000000001s)]
*  the worst season might be going sideways, like, Oh shit, could we get Steve back [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6581.360000000001s)]
*  for TV? [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6586.320000000001s)]
*  Cause that would be incredible. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6586.92s)]
*  Um, you know, I think it's probably a coach who's recently, I think doc could [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6588.84s)]
*  have been really good last year if he hadn't left after 40 games. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6594.52s)]
*  I think it's probably a coach who has recently gone against everybody. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6598.320000000001s)]
*  He's calling the games is probably the biggest advantage for this. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6602.96s)]
*  And then the ability to actually be candid about what they're seeing. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6605.92s)]
*  He's got to be done. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6609.16s)]
*  Cause any coach that gets into broadcasting is getting in there to get his [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6610.76s)]
*  next coaching job. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6613.68s)]
*  So it's gotta be like a Madden type where like, I'm out, this is it. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6614.44s)]
*  I'm out. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6617.28s)]
*  And now I'm going to be letting it fly from now on. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6617.92s)]
*  But, um, the other problem is the, the, I think, I think Wade could have been [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6620.2s)]
*  really interesting if he had just been like, all I want to do is be a TV color [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6624.28s)]
*  guy for games, but Wade's made $400 million or $380 million. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6627.6s)]
*  Whatever it was like, he owns a piece of Utah. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6633.24s)]
*  So, you know, I don't know if the money is the same, whereas the NFL could be [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6635.2s)]
*  like, no, Tom Brady, come do this. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6639.12s)]
*  Here's $35 million or Hey, Troy, Troy, Hickman, keep doing this. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6640.64s)]
*  Here's a lot of money. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6645.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, the money is just different. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6646.44s)]
*  I don't, I just don't think it matters as much in basketball and football. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6647.96s)]
*  There's a weightiness you kind of need for a big game. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6651.72s)]
*  You really want to be in good hands with the right announcers. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6655.4800000000005s)]
*  You really want to have them walk you through stuff and teach you stuff. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6658.04s)]
*  I don't know if basketball needs that as much. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6661.48s)]
*  Do you think it needs it? [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6663.4s)]
*  Priscilla? [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6664.08s)]
*  Like, you feel like we needed like the greatest announcers ever for OKC, uh, [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6665.4s)]
*  Denver today, because for the most part, you kind of know what's happening. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6670.04s)]
*  The guys today are great, by the way, passion legs are terrific. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6675.44s)]
*  Legs did a good job. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6678.16s)]
*  Legs did a good job. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6679.839999999999s)]
*  That was one of the reasons I thought about it. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6679.879999999999s)]
*  Has a lot of moments in games where he is on it. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6682.0s)]
*  Like he is seeing some of the stuff that I'm talking about. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6685.24s)]
*  There was a game. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6687.36s)]
*  I forget. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6689.04s)]
*  I think it might've been a Phoenix game or something, but he basically had figured [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6689.64s)]
*  out like this coverage isn't working. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6692.8s)]
*  He goes, look for them to bring two on this next one and try to meet him on the [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6694.8s)]
*  catch and he just, he predicted the future. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6698.8s)]
*  It was perfect. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6701.32s)]
*  And the next possession of the thing that the team was running on the catch, uh, [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6702.08s)]
*  the other team brought two defenders. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6706.76s)]
*  And I just, I just think that's really important stuff. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6708.28s)]
*  Like just give me a couple of those, you know, just a couple of game. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6710.92s)]
*  That tells me that, you know, because you played or because you coach or you've [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6714.68s)]
*  spent your life in the sport, there's going to be a couple moments that I may [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6719.08s)]
*  not be picking up on all the stuff. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6722.88s)]
*  Cause I think even TV sometimes at home, I can find myself like losing track of [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6724.88s)]
*  some of the stuff we're like, Oh, I didn't realize that they, they haven't contested [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6729.24s)]
*  or this is the guy that they're ignoring is you're trying to keep track of all [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6733.12s)]
*  this stuff that's happening in the game. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6735.72s)]
*  The big moment stuff. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6737.32s)]
*  I think you're right. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6739.68s)]
*  I think football needs a little bit more that overhead shot of a stadium, [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6740.639999999999s)]
*  a hundred thousand people, people losing their minds. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6744.36s)]
*  I think that's why Musburger lasted as long as he did. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6746.44s)]
*  I think Brent would be the first. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6749.12s)]
*  He even admitted it in some of the interviews. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6750.08s)]
*  He's like, I stick to last names. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6751.759999999999s)]
*  He almost wanted to find a way to be more efficient and like limit the bad shots. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6753.48s)]
*  But when it was Saturday night and it was a big college football matchup and you [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6757.96s)]
*  heard Musburger bring you in, it just sounded right, even if he might screw up [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6763.04s)]
*  a third down, because I think there's some football guys that if I'm really [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6768.12s)]
*  paying attention, I'm like, is this guy screwing up all the time or whatever? [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6771.48s)]
*  But I don't know that we care. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6775.48s)]
*  I think, you know, part of it is, is it a voice that I feel familiar with? [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6777.68s)]
*  And it's hard to become that. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6783.12s)]
*  Like you just have to keep getting all those opportunities. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6784.8s)]
*  But I think that's a big reason why they went back to Musburger later in his life [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6787.32s)]
*  because it felt right when that camera shot or camera shot opened up in the [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6790.96s)]
*  first, the first voice we heard was his. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6795.8s)]
*  One thing I liked about being going to that I miss now, and I actually thought [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6798.68s)]
*  the game last night needed, maybe Jefferson could get there. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6801.84s)]
*  There was a, you know, there's the what's happening in the game. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6805.28s)]
*  You have that whole piece. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6808.2s)]
*  What are the storylines coming into the game? [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6809.44s)]
*  Van Gundy was really good at like the Celtics last night. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6812.44s)]
*  Tatum just doesn't come out for the whole first quarter. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6816.04s)]
*  They start the second quarter. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6818.4s)]
*  Joe Mas leaves them out. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6820.32s)]
*  It leaves plays in the first 18 minutes of the game. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6821.5199999999995s)]
*  And at some point during that, cause I was texting with, uh, with Celtic [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6823.72s)]
*  friends about it, we're like, Oh shit, we're treating this like a game seven. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6827.24s)]
*  Like, this is really interesting that we're treating the game this way. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6831.44s)]
*  Like we're going big minutes for the best guys in the team. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6834.4s)]
*  Like, Hmm, this is an interesting subplot that's developing and they just [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6837.92s)]
*  didn't talk about it on the broadcast. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6842.719999999999s)]
*  And I always thought Van Gundy stuff like that didn't slide by him. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6844.2s)]
*  And that's like kind of the last thing is like, when some sort of big thing [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6847.48s)]
*  is developing out of a game, you got to see it immediately. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6852.2s)]
*  And if you don't, then why are you there? [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6856.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6859.64s)]
*  And to me, that's a play by play announcers thing too. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6859.88s)]
*  Noticing that that you're talking about going 18. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6861.88s)]
*  That's a, that's a thing. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6865.240000000001s)]
*  I think that a Breen, uh, an eye and Eagle, a Toreco, when he starts doing [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6866.96s)]
*  it full time next year, we'll be all over. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6871.320000000001s)]
*  You know, that's the thing they, they can, I mean, basketball to me is just [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6873.6s)]
*  such a play by play announcer sport. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6876.320000000001s)]
*  Like it's their, it's their game, you know, much more than a football game is. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6877.72s)]
*  And the really good ones will just be all over little things like that. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6881.400000000001s)]
*  They know. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6884.4800000000005s)]
*  I remember when Jaylen and I did a game with Toreco, we did like a Celtic [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6885.52s)]
*  Laker game 2013 or 14 and Toreco just let us do our thing for like 42, 43 minutes. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6888.8s)]
*  Then last five minutes was like, okay guys, I've got this. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6896.2s)]
*  Then he just took over the last five and I was like, oh yeah. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6901.0s)]
*  Cause it's ultimately it's a play by play sport. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6904.56s)]
*  All right. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6906.72s)]
*  I could talk about this stuff all day. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6907.04s)]
*  Curtis, what do you care about this week for the pod? [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6908.4400000000005s)]
*  Anything? [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6910.28s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6910.92s)]
*  Uh, we got an NBA four pack coming up tomorrow. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6911.76s)]
*  Can it, what does that mean? [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6914.92s)]
*  We got, well, we got a four P and a Stephen a of course. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6915.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6919.4400000000005s)]
*  We got Draymond, Carl, Anthony towns, which we didn't even really get into. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6919.64s)]
*  Uh, we got the cube interview. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6923.08s)]
*  Hey, that, that one is like, just apologize. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6924.28s)]
*  You got it wrong. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6926.52s)]
*  But the best part was you're going to have a platform apologize when you fuck [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6927.8s)]
*  stuff up, that's it. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6930.92s)]
*  But the best part was him getting the whole trademark name of the podcast [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6932.12s)]
*  in, in the non-apology. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6935.36s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6937.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6939.84s)]
*  That made me so happy. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6940.72s)]
*  So what's the, what's the fourth part of the four part? [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6941.68s)]
*  Uh, wait, Stephen, Draymond, Barclay, that's four. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6944.52s)]
*  Cuban Cuban. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6950.64s)]
*  Okay. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6951.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6952.52s)]
*  Rosilla, what do you care about this week? [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6953.4400000000005s)]
*  Did your dad text you that they could, he could kind of understand why they [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6955.320000000001s)]
*  traded Luca after watching him up and down the court. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6958.6s)]
*  He did express concern that Luca did not seem healthy. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6963.4800000000005s)]
*  That was this thing. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6968.8s)]
*  My dad was always scared of the Lakers with Davis. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6969.84s)]
*  That was a real thing for him. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6972.320000000001s)]
*  He, he's always scared of teams with size and the playoffs and things slow down. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6973.76s)]
*  So there you go. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6978.08s)]
*  Uh, before we go, quick question, Rosilla. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6979.2s)]
*  So I was tweeting about, does the NFL salary cap matter when it goes [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6981.52s)]
*  up $30 million a year? [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6984.72s)]
*  No, it's unbelievable. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6986.96s)]
*  Why do we do these like hundred best free agents coming up and all of them are [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6988.16s)]
*  just going to resign with their teams. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6992.04s)]
*  Cause you can just spend whatever you want. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6993.4400000000005s)]
*  Miles Garrett, having a change of heart. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6995.76s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6998.280000000001s)]
*  Great. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=6998.64s)]
*  I love how dumb we all are. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7000.6s)]
*  Like he couldn't just go, Oh, I didn't know they were going to pay me this. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7003.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7006.16s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7006.6s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7007.64s)]
*  And then, but instead they have to craft something like as if he was sitting [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7007.92s)]
*  around being like, you know, really love this place. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7011.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7014.6s)]
*  The more I'm thinking about it. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7015.12s)]
*  Once you put that four in the, in the yearly salary instead of the three, I [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7017.08s)]
*  really started like Cleveland a lot more. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7022.64s)]
*  This is bad for Parsons and the Cowboys. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7024.6s)]
*  So it feels like it might be. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7026.4800000000005s)]
*  It's horrible. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7027.72s)]
*  He was already licking his lips on Twitter today. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7028.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, he's like, Oh yeah, here we go. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7030.56s)]
*  Cowboys waited too long again. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7032.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7035.92s)]
*  Cause with the cap, I get it. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7036.08s)]
*  I understand it keeps going up and all you're doing is just pushing money to [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7038.16s)]
*  the next year and hoping that at some point, you don't have to pay the piper. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7043.16s)]
*  And then if you get in a Russell Wilson, Denver situation, that's when it goes [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7047.08s)]
*  bad, where it's like, you keep pushing the money and then it's like, Oh, this [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7050.16s)]
*  guy didn't work out. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7053.280000000001s)]
*  Now we are completely fucked for an entire season. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7054.08s)]
*  But for the most part, it just seems like these teams can just, you know, [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7056.72s)]
*  Dallas is going to be able to afford Parsons. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7060.400000000001s)]
*  It just seems like all these teams can afford whoever they want. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7062.36s)]
*  Well, cause they can. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7065.28s)]
*  I mean, the spikes every year it's gone up like seven, eight. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7066.2s)]
*  It went up 14% one year and 24 went up 13% against the previous year. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7070.28s)]
*  So the salary cap for 2025 is 279 in 2015. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7075.839999999999s)]
*  It was 143. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7081.24s)]
*  So the cap has almost doubled in 10 years. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7082.799999999999s)]
*  And so every time you're structuring these contracts, and by the way, there's [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7085.96s)]
*  another lesson in there too is like, why are you waiting to do any extension [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7088.28s)]
*  with anybody like a Jemar chase or like a Micah Parsons, like get it over with. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7092.04s)]
*  Do your quarterback early. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7097.68s)]
*  So a lot of the times too, when you see the quarterback numbers come out and [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7099.4s)]
*  you're like, that guy's getting paid that much and it's that guaranteed. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7101.72s)]
*  You go, dude, year four of this deal, it's going to look like a steal based [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7104.36s)]
*  on percentage of the salary cap. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7107.76s)]
*  So we talked about some of the NFL NBA part of it. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7109.0s)]
*  I don't know that that's ever addressed enough. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7112.84s)]
*  You can't really be in cap hell anymore in the NFL. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7115.12s)]
*  Doesn't seem like it. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7119.04s)]
*  Well, there's one way. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7120.04s)]
*  You can, but not really. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7121.4s)]
*  There's one way. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7123.12s)]
*  If you have the Deshaun Watson, Russell Wilson, like big money thing that [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7123.639999999999s)]
*  goes completely wrong and even then it seems like it's okay. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7128.0s)]
*  But they have to be able just not to play at all, which was what those guys [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7131.04s)]
*  were both into. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7134.12s)]
*  I'm not saying it's impossible, but if, if you were to look at these [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7134.719999999999s)]
*  projections and where the cap is ultimately going in the NFL, I don't. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7138.679999999999s)]
*  There's just more leeway on top of the other cap rule with the NFL that I don't [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7144.639999999999s)]
*  know that anybody ever really talks about and like carrying over some of that cap [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7149.0s)]
*  space, which we've always talked about with the NBA, because the NBA cap thing [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7151.96s)]
*  that I hate is that depending on when your rookies are due their extensions, [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7155.8s)]
*  you can have this cap room window and then you have to spend it on somebody [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7160.84s)]
*  that you probably don't want to. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7166.08s)]
*  And then it ends up that everybody's spending way too much on a free agent [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7167.56s)]
*  signing the non like tier one guys, just because you're hoping somebody takes [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7171.12s)]
*  your cap space because all that cap space disappears just because the [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7176.08s)]
*  rookies have a raise in the NFL. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7179.0s)]
*  Sure. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7181.44s)]
*  There's part of that with the quarterback or maybe you nail it with like an all [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7181.76s)]
*  pro guy who's a non quarterback and some of this, but looking at how, how much [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7184.88s)]
*  this cap has taken off, um, it fixes a lot of problems for teams. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7189.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7196.32s)]
*  The pats needed a left tackle and still do. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7196.48s)]
*  And there was this long list of free agent left tackles and now all of them are [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7199.76s)]
*  gone. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7203.0s)]
*  And then I, it's a complete panic on the, on the pats fans text threads, [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7204.6s)]
*  cause it's like our two choices now are to overpay somebody who's not good or to [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7209.44s)]
*  take a guy who might end up being a guard instead of a tackle with the fourth [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7213.72s)]
*  pick in the draft. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7216.92s)]
*  And it's just like, I thought we were getting Ronnie Stanley. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7218.4s)]
*  That was on everybody's list. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7221.68s)]
*  Oh wait, he's going back to the Ravens. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7223.48s)]
*  I don't get it. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7225.68s)]
*  My favorite cap thing ever was that whenever the hockey lost its mind and [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7226.2s)]
*  people were given like 20 year contracts to as a cap to, to remember that. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7229.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7235.28s)]
*  And it was like, this guy's going to have a 20 year, $80 million contracts [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7235.64s)]
*  and they get spread out. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7239.96s)]
*  It's like, what's going on? [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7241.2s)]
*  Uh, all right, Brian Curtis. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7242.8s)]
*  Great to see you as always. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7244.28s)]

*  you're the new Diane Cannon. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7252.04s)]
*  Kovalchuk 17 years, 102 million with the devils. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7254.04s)]
*  17 years. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7258.4800000000005s)]
*  Can you imagine if NBA GMs were allowed to do that? [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7262.8s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7265.76s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7266.68s)]
*  It would not be good. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7267.56s)]
*  All right. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7268.4400000000005s)]
*  Good to see you. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTzfvNTFJNE&t=7268.64s)]
