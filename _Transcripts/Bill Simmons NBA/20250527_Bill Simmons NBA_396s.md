# Bill Simmons’s Top 15 NBA Player Pyramid | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE)
*  I'm gonna give you my 15-player pyramid right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=0.0s)]
*  I was thinking about Hal Bern's place. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=3.04s)]
*  I'm just gonna throw this at you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=6.08s)]
*  Start with one. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=8.08s)]
*  Jokic. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=9.92s)]
*  Still one. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=10.88s)]
*  SGA. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=12.32s)]
*  I saw a lot of SGA's the best player in the league now. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  SGA's knocking on the door. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=14.88s)]
*  And then we're gonna talk about OKC in a second. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=17.12s)]
*  SGA's definitely like, hey guys, what's going on over here on the top spot of the pyramid? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=19.12s)]
*  Hey. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=24.48s)]
*  Jokic had some beers. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=25.28s)]
*  He's not getting up to answer the door. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=26.48s)]
*  No. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  Doors locked. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=28.64s)]
*  Him and his brothers, they're watching super bad. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=29.28s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=31.520000000000003s)]
*  SGA and Giannis, 2-3. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=32.32s)]
*  Ant and Luka, 4-5. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=35.68s)]
*  By the way, Tatum's not in the pyramid because he's not playing for a year. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=38.08s)]
*  Yeah, you are very loyal to this format of just if you're out for the year, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=40.64s)]
*  you're out of the rankings. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=45.04s)]
*  I'm not ranking you. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=46.24s)]
*  Which I like to... [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=47.28s)]
*  If you're not gonna play next season, you can't be in there. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=48.88s)]
*  I have Wemby sixth. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=51.44s)]
*  Do you agree or disagree? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=53.44s)]
*  Because I'm projecting where he's going next year. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=54.72s)]
*  He fucking grew an inch. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=58.0s)]
*  Are you following this? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  He's 7'7 now. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=60.72s)]
*  I'm only following it because I heard you talking about it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=62.32s)]
*  He's 7'7 allegedly. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=64.56s)]
*  And how 7'7 just sounds strange. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=66.0s)]
*  Can we pay-per-view and give the proceeds to charity where they actually measure Wemby [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=68.72s)]
*  and we find out exactly how tall he is for $19.99? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=73.36s)]
*  Where did you have Ant? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=77.36s)]
*  Four. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=78.88s)]
*  Feels really high. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=80.0s)]
*  You had Ant over Luka? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=80.88s)]
*  Can I find out if Luka's gonna be in shape next season? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=83.44s)]
*  I like the skinny slash fat photos that go around of Flair's in the offseason [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=87.44s)]
*  when it's like, is it just the clothes they're wearing? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=92.32s)]
*  Is it just the way they're standing? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=94.56s)]
*  Why are we reading so much into this? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=96.24s)]
*  You could make me look 20 pounds lighter or 20 pounds heavier very easily. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=98.08s)]
*  Every photo has like a 15 pound variance just depending on the photo. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=103.28s)]
*  I have no idea if he's lost any weight or not. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=108.0s)]
*  Allegedly, he cares a little bit more. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=110.4s)]
*  So you'd have Luka over Ant. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=113.36s)]
*  Ant made the Western Finals two years in a row. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=115.36s)]
*  I feel like it's notable. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=117.2s)]
*  Luka made the finals and the Western Finals in the three years span. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=119.84s)]
*  He did. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=123.12s)]
*  He got traded by the genius Nico Harrison though. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  Ant never got traded. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=127.76s)]
*  I have Wemby sixth. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=130.56s)]
*  Then I have Curry, Mitchell, Halbert and Brunson as my seven through ten. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=132.32s)]
*  And if Halbert makes the finals, I'm moving him over Mitchell. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=138.4s)]
*  Sorry, Mitchell. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=140.96s)]
*  Because sorry, I'm a recency bias guy. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=141.84s)]
*  And if you make the finals as when you're clearly the best player in a team and you [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=143.84s)]
*  wouldn't go through three straight playoff rounds where you beat Giannis, you beat a [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=147.6s)]
*  64 win Cavalier team, and then you beat this loaded Knicks team, you have to be in the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  top 10. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  And then my bottom, my last level is Cade, number 11, Anthony Davis, Towns, Mobley, and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=157.28s)]
*  Jalen Williams, who officially won me over after last night. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  I think he has to be in the top 10. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=169.84s)]
*  I think he has to be in the top 15. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=171.36s)]
*  Anybody, does anything make you go, eh? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=173.68s)]
*  No, it's just interesting that obviously everyone is well aware that we have this [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  generation of superstars that are aging. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=182.16000000000003s)]
*  And so they're aging out of discussions like this, like LeBron, although you have [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=184.56s)]
*  Curry in here too. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=187.68s)]
*  You also just have like, and Durant, you didn't mention Durant. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=188.8s)]
*  And I don't, I can't quibble with it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=191.52s)]
*  Like if you just told a random guy on the street, Tyrese Halbert is better than [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=193.68s)]
*  Kevin Durant, I think that would get a why. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=197.28000000000003s)]
*  35 and 47 last year or whatever it was. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=201.28s)]
*  Like, I'm sorry. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=203.68s)]
*  Then you have other guys who like are just like, Joel Embiid is injured all the time. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=204.56s)]
*  Jimmy Butler, Jimmy Butler is injured. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=210.96s)]
*  Slept, Jimmy Butler and it focused healthy, happy Jimmy Butler is probably in this [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=213.6s)]
*  conversation, but that guy doesn't exist very often anymore. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=218.8s)]
*  The Minnesota series, I think killed that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=222.56s)]
*  I think he can get there every once in a while, but I think, don't you also believe [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=225.36s)]
*  that he just didn't seem impactful enough. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=230.32s)]
*  Well, and I think when you're, when you get to 35 and up, I think asking somebody to [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=233.92s)]
*  be good for nine months is really, really insure. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=239.04s)]
*  We don't have a lot of history of it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=242.48s)]
*  He fell hard on his tailbone and I'm not sure he, and then like, like we all thought, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=244.23999999999998s)]
*  we all thought not long ago that both Morant and Zion would like maybe be in this [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  conversation in Morant's case, like definitely be in this conversation. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=256.96s)]
*  And they're just like not even sniffing it right now. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=260.4s)]
*  It's just, it's a strange, it's a strange, strange times. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=263.44s)]
*  Well, so the biggest thing that's changed in the playoffs is Hal Burton ascending into [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  that top 10. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=271.12s)]
*  Kawhi is another one. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=274.0s)]
*  Kawhi healthy Kawhi top 10 player. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=274.79999999999995s)]
*  So I had my five close, my, my five honorable mention guys in no particular order, Tatum, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=277.35999999999996s)]
*  LeBron, Kawhi, Chet and Durant. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=283.84s)]
*  I think is the next group right underneath. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=287.91999999999996s)]
*  And then Booker you could talk me into, but I think he gets, he, he should get some of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=289.76s)]
*  the same, same criticism. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  This episode is brought to you by Uber Eats. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itsdiudTIE&t=298.0s)]
