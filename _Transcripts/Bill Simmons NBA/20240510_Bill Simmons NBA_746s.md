# Suns Fire Frank Vogel and the NBA Star Coaching Carousel | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4)
*  We did have a Frank Vogel firing today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=0.0s)]
*  Apparently it was his fault that Bradley Beal fell out of game four, had six [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=4.04s)]
*  turnovers and played one of the three or four worst games of this decade. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=8.6s)]
*  Um, I went and I went through all the great players and tried to answer the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=12.84s)]
*  question who's had the most coaches since the 2014 playoffs. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=18.86s)]
*  So exactly 10 years from right now. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=22.54s)]
*  So it would count if your coach is in the 2010 playoffs. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=25.02s)]
*  Our leader is Kevin Durant at eight. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=28.96s)]
*  And that's not counting the ninth coach that they're about to hire. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=32.2s)]
*  Coming in second, Kyrie Irving also eight. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=36.14s)]
*  Now he was traded a couple of times, but eight coaches for him. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=38.36s)]
*  A surprise third place guy was Devin Booker was seven and we're [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=43.34s)]
*  about to have number eight. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=48.22s)]
*  That's not Devin Booker is managerial incompetence. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=49.92s)]
*  They just kept screwing that thing up. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=54.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=57.12s)]
*  I'm listening. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=57.36s)]
*  I'm, I'm just the stats guy. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=58.08s)]
*  I don't think Devin Booker is a coach killer, but cook. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=60.16s)]
*  Well, he's about to be eight. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=63.44s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=65.0s)]
*  He's about to be on number eight. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=65.28s)]
*  James Harden and Russell Westbrook both tied for seven at seven for a [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=66.84s)]
*  tied for fourth place. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=71.88s)]
*  And then, uh, LeBron is at six plus the new coach. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=73.32s)]
*  So who'd be at seven? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=76.46s)]
*  Yannis and Butler both five. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=78.28s)]
*  Dame, AD, Kawhi four and bead three. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=81.12s)]
*  Curry two, Tatum two. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=84.75999999999999s)]
*  Yokeage one. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  He said one coach. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  Um, biggest surprise for you on that list was Booker. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=90.84s)]
*  Yeah, Booker for sure. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  Just cause you know, it's not like he's been this powerful entity in the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  NBA for his whole career, right? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  Like he came in as like the 14th or 13th pick or whatever it was, and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=107.28s)]
*  then outperformed the expectation for a while guys like Bill Simmons was [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=111.92s)]
*  saying he was a good stats, bad team guy. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=115.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=118.28s)]
*  He was. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=118.48s)]
*  I, I don't apologize. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=119.04s)]
*  He was, but then he became an obvious all star, all in the kind of guy. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=121.84s)]
*  And so I don't be good, but I'm surprised. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=126.52s)]
*  And we called him a good stats, good, good team guy. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=129.12s)]
*  Trey Young. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=133.28s)]
*  What's Trey Young now? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=134.0s)]
*  Cause he was a good stats, bad team guy. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  Then made the playoffs. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=138.16s)]
*  So he was a good stats, good team guy. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=139.48s)]
*  Now he's a good stats, mediocre team guy. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=141.04s)]
*  I think he's a needs some humility in a new scenery guy for sure. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=143.04s)]
*  Brooklyn Nets. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=149.72s)]
*  He changed agents this week. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=153.88s)]
*  CAA. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  There was only room at clutch for one between him and Murray. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=157.88s)]
*  House, what was your biggest surprise in that list? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=160.76s)]
*  It was definitely Devin Booker. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=163.07999999999998s)]
*  I didn't recall. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=164.35999999999999s)]
*  It's a combination for Devin Booker of how long he's been on the league. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=165.68s)]
*  And I probably have forgotten how long he's been in the league, but [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=168.92s)]
*  also like that institutional, that kind of a rotate rotating coach chair in [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=171.64s)]
*  Phoenix, cause he's only been with one team, right? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=177.32s)]
*  Devin Booker only one team. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=179.88s)]
*  That's a lot of coaches for a guy who's only been in the league for, you know, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  remember he had that Igor guy that one time coach Igor, that guy was in there. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=184.68s)]
*  They tried them all. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=189.4s)]
*  Well, Katie's going to be on coach number nine. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=191.28s)]
*  As you know, I'm accused in some circles of being a KD supporter, even a KD [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=195.48s)]
*  stan. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=200.72000000000003s)]
*  This Vogel thing's a tough one to defend. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=202.16000000000003s)]
*  It just is. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=207.04000000000002s)]
*  Cause Vogel's a good coach and I, I just don't know how you go from winning a [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  title to being the problem in two different cities in the span of four years. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=213.44000000000003s)]
*  Skip Bayless had an incredible tweet that someone sent me, um, where he talked [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=218.52s)]
*  about Frank Vogel won a title in the bubble. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=225.44000000000003s)]
*  And then since then he's been fired twice. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=227.84s)]
*  And if that's not all the proof you need that the bubble was a fake title. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  That's it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=234.84s)]
*  I was like, I really admire the craftsmanship for that crazy. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=235.36s)]
*  The dedication is really just in the lab pumping that one out. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=239.56s)]
*  But, uh, but yeah, my guy KD house, I don't know, man. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=246.24s)]
*  It's a lot of coaches. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=249.52s)]
*  The question is with that situation, um, nobody really had Frank Vogel. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  Nobody really had Frank Vogel as, as landing in Phoenix, right? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=256.44s)]
*  There was the undercurrent with the new owner was that there was another guy. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  There was an in-house guy, right? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=264.16s)]
*  Kevin Young. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=265.88s)]
*  And then all of a sudden doc was involved and poor doc who could have had his choice [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=266.56s)]
*  of like Phoenix or the Lakers. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=272.64s)]
*  I assume one of these and then went to Milwaukee and everybody got hurt. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=275.36s)]
*  And I was stuck in Milwaukee. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=278.24s)]
*  Um, but it sounds like Phoenix, Phoenix did the thing where they fired Vogel and [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=280.04s)]
*  then like three minutes later, it's like, word is they're very interested in coach [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=285.6s)]
*  bud. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=291.56s)]
*  And so now, you know, he's getting the job. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=292.52000000000004s)]
*  He's putting the stays from Arizona. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=294.36s)]
*  Uh, so why is coach bud is now a good coach again? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  I don't think he was ever a bad coach. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=300.56s)]
*  I think the bug stands random out of town. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=302.28000000000003s)]
*  Bucks read it was just annihilating them. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=305.20000000000005s)]
*  The situation in Milwaukee kind of ran its course and the, the, the buds value [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=308.08000000000004s)]
*  was realized when the bucks were playing the most undisciplined offense in the NBA, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=313.64000000000004s)]
*  despite having some success. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=321.40000000000003s)]
*  Cause you could do that against some of the mediocre NBA defenses when you have that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=323.0s)]
*  much talent, but they were so undisciplined in like their space and principles and like [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=326.88s)]
*  stuff like who would even bring the ball up and who guys breaking off a place like [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=331.32000000000005s)]
*  they were just undisciplined. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=336.04s)]
*  It was obvious the stuff that they hated bud for, which was being a stickler. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=337.20000000000005s)]
*  Turns out it actually worked. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=341.24s)]
*  Um, and the sons had the worst fourth quarter offense in the NBA this year, which [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=343.0s)]
*  is insane when you consider their offensive talent. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=349.32s)]
*  So if they can get a task manager that have them just like being in the right [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=352.2s)]
*  spots and running good stuff, I think that's like found money. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=356.59999999999997s)]
*  That's like an easy way to just get way better than what they did last year. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=360.4s)]
*  So I'm not completely against the hiring. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=364.2s)]
*  I'm just skeptical that a culture, a team unity, a togetherness can be crafted from [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=366.44s)]
*  bringing bud in with this particular group. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=375.52s)]
*  Um, just look at the Timberwolves and how they've all galvanized around and his [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=378.64s)]
*  personality, sorry, love KD, one of the biggest bags, best bags, most skilled bags [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=384.56s)]
*  in the history of offense. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=391.67999999999995s)]
*  He's never proven himself to be that kind of person. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=393.68s)]
*  I don't know that Devin Booker has it in him to be that either. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=396.88s)]
*  Who's going to be the person that makes the sons into a team, a unit, a connected [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=399.6s)]
*  group, you know, that you could bring bud in. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=405.48s)]
*  Brett Bradley Beal. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=410.16s)]
*  Uh, I think Bud's a really good coach. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=412.48s)]
*  I don't think he's one of the top three coaches, but he's a really good coach. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=414.64s)]
*  And, um, I don't know if it's going to matter when you have a team that's built [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=418.36s)]
*  around three guys, one of whom is 36, one of whom is Bradley Beal. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=423.32s)]
*  I don't. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=428.15999999999997s)]
*  And the other thing is, and we talked about this a couple of pods ago house, but [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=428.56s)]
*  like Minnesota, OKC, Denver, even the Celtics, like there's just young, deep, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=432.52s)]
*  athletic, awesome teams. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=439.28s)]
*  And that just putting together that goofy big three model, or one of the big three [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=442.6s)]
*  is Bradley Beal, who you can't trade because he has no fucking trade clause [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=447.68s)]
*  that you didn't even ask him to drop and he doesn't trade. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=451.40000000000003s)]
*  And then to rant who was in the 2007 draft. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=454.56s)]
*  You don't think the Bartlesteins should have been negotiating against each other [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=457.08s)]
*  in the execution of that trade? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=461.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=463.68s)]
*  Wait that for Bradley Beal. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=465.16s)]
*  But, uh, but I just don't like, there's no way to improve that team. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=468.48s)]
*  So congrats, your offense is going to look a little better, but you're still [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=472.48s)]
*  not beating anybody. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=475.32s)]
*  How's do you buy anything into Minnesota was so awesome. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=476.36s)]
*  Maybe Phoenix feels better about themselves now. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=478.84s)]
*  No, it wasn't that bad. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=481.32s)]
*  It's nonsense talk. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=483.4s)]
*  No, it was that bad. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=484.64s)]
*  We watched it. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=485.96s)]
*  It was bad. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=486.47999999999996s)]
*  Uh, I'm bummed cause I wanted to coach bud to come here to Washington. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=487.4s)]
*  Uh, and, and you know, maybe get JJ Reddick. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=490.92s)]
*  Doesn't seem like a good match. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=496.59999999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=498.71999999999997s)]
*  I, I, I want somebody that can come do some nurturing. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=499.88s)]
*  I don't want a guy that, that, you know, no offense to JJ. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=502.91999999999996s)]
*  Obviously, but this is not a learned on the fly kind of job. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=506.12s)]
*  We need, we need, we need an adult. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=509.88s)]
*  It's time for an adult associated with the Washington basketball team. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=511.96s)]
*  We finally have it on the football side. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=515.92s)]
*  I'd like one trustworthy adult. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=518.0s)]
*  We have it now in the decision makers, you know, the GM, uh, office here in [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=520.08s)]
*  Washington, but we need a good coach. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=526.4s)]
*  Was I did a YouTube short a week ago about how I thought LeBron should become [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=529.72s)]
*  the player coach of the Lakers. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=534.6800000000001s)]
*  Because he's clearly just never going to be happy with a coach. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=536.12s)]
*  And I also don't know why I knew it would want to be the coach of that team at [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=539.44s)]
*  this point, when it's the ultimate no win job. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=543.76s)]
*  Um, and then there was some player coach momentum this week in other circles. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=546.8s)]
*  And I think it's illegal with team rules, but I was thinking like, could, could [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=551.68s)]
*  they make Maverick Carter the coach? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=556.4s)]
*  So basically LeBron's the player coach. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=558.04s)]
*  Maverick's pretending to be the head coach, but really LeBron's running it. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=560.72s)]
*  And he gets to hang out with his buddy and then his buddy would have job security [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=564.5600000000001s)]
*  because LeBron takes care of his boys. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=567.48s)]
*  The, the one problem with the LeBron as player coach is that there leaves no room [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=570.48s)]
*  for somebody to throw the blame or throw under the bus. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=576.32s)]
*  Well, he could blame himself as the coach. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=579.2800000000001s)]
*  It would be, it could be like, it could be like the end of problem of fear. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=581.36s)]
*  Would that explain me the other version of Ed Norton? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=584.6400000000001s)]
*  That's, that's, that's my only issue with that one is that LeBron would have, like, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=587.04s)]
*  it's just, it'd be too easy to point to LeBron and his ambition and all of that [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=595.56s)]
*  power hungry and all of that stuff, if it didn't work out. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=601.1999999999999s)]
*  So, and, and we know LeBron's not in the business of taking the blame or taking a [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=604.52s)]
*  fall for things that don't go right. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=608.36s)]
*  So that's why I personally can't see it. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=610.4399999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=612.92s)]
*  As you don't see it either. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=613.5999999999999s)]
*  I wish they would change the rules. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=614.7199999999999s)]
*  I mean, Bill Russell won two titles as a player coach. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=616.16s)]
*  It's the thing that succeeded when I was growing up. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=619.56s)]
*  Dave Cowans was a player coach for us for like two, three months. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=621.4s)]
*  It was cool. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=625.12s)]
*  He would come out of the game, towel off. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=625.8s)]
*  He'd have a clipboard. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=627.52s)]
*  It was neat. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=628.36s)]
*  One of those things, maybe Corey Kispert could be the Wizards head coach. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=629.92s)]
*  I don't, I don't, I don't get this trolling. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=633.24s)]
*  Kyle Kuzma? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=635.12s)]
*  I say you're anti-player coach. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=638.3199999999999s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=639.8399999999999s)]
*  I mean, this is, this is a whole bit of, with, with, with LeBron. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=641.4399999999999s)]
*  LeBron didn't drive Darwin Ham out. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=645.0s)]
*  They're, they have a, you, you properly. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=647.68s)]
*  No, but Palinka, Palinka drives them out. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=649.72s)]
*  That's right. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=652.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=653.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=653.52s)]
*  No, that there's, I think Palinka is the one because you're the GM. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=653.64s)]
*  You want to keep your job. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=657.4s)]
*  If things aren't going well, you spend the most time with the owner. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=659.12s)]
*  You spend more time with the owner than anybody else. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=662.2s)]
*  You're like, man, what the fuck was that coaching thing today? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=664.04s)]
*  Oh, these adjustments in the fourth quarter. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=667.16s)]
*  You're just like playing in the seeds with Genie. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=671.88s)]
*  He yelled at me when I said, Darwin Ham did a pretty decent job on the Lakers. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=673.64s)]
*  And basically they said his Cardinal sin was that he went away from the Western [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=678.3199999999999s)]
*  conference championship lineup. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=683.3199999999999s)]
*  That was the Cardinal sin. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=685.16s)]
*  That did anyone watch Rui in the playoffs? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=687.16s)]
*  He sucked. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=689.1999999999999s)]
*  Watch the games. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=692.24s)]
*  He was terrible. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=693.16s)]
*  Breaking news. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=694.28s)]
*  He sucks. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=695.6s)]
*  He was bad. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=697.52s)]
*  People were like, Oh, we gotta get back to the Western finals thing. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=698.6s)]
*  It's like, you mean when he got hot for like three games? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=701.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's what people said was Darwin Ham's unforgivable sin. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=704.72s)]
*  He he put all he took Austin as a sixth man because Austin wasn't defending to [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=710.5200000000001s)]
*  start the year and he was trying to establish a defensive identity and, you [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=715.44s)]
*  know, D-Lo and like, you know, like, come on, man, it's not like these guys were [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=719.8000000000001s)]
*  world beaters, but yeah, allegedly this is like, you know, D-Lo coming off the [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=724.2s)]
*  bench is you just can't do it. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=730.32s)]
*  Can't accept it. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=731.72s)]
*  Ridiculous. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hOdV1zRWi4&t=733.9200000000001s)]
