# Six Major Things Going On in Sports | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [February 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3_08l32nv8)
*  When you look at the numbers and you look at the body of work, like this isn't fluky.
*  He is this good offensively and he's been an amazing team karma guy too.
*  Brought to you by Michelob Ultra, the official beer sponsor of the NBA.
*  Win or lose, you're bound to enjoy the ride with a good beer in hand.
*  And Michelob Ultra, it's good beer.
*  It's crisp, it's light, it's refreshing.
*  It's only 95 calories.
*  So order yourself an ultra six pack while we unpack six major things going on in
*  basketball and in some of the other sports too.
*  I want to lead with somebody you wouldn't expect.
*  Chris Stabs Porzingis.
*  He was like, Oh, all right.
*  Yeah, we did.
*  You know, he bounced around.
*  He's been in New York.
*  He was in Dallas.
*  He was in Washington, Boston.
*  His fourth team is 28 years old.
*  Yet the Celtics fans are talking about him.
*  Like he's the cheat code of this team.
*  He's the superpower of this team.
*  And I think from afar, people haven't watched him in Washington or even haven't
*  watched him that much in the Celtics this year.
*  It's like, Oh, give me a break.
*  He's going to get hurt.
*  Whatever.
*  I don't think people understand how good Porzingis is.
*  Not just this year, but really for the 2020s, his per 36 numbers, just for this
*  decade, the 2020s, he's averaging 24 and 10, 47% shooting two blocks a game.
*  If you look at all the guys this decade who have averaged 24 and nine, right.
*  Per 36, it's Yocage, Giannis and Bede, Davis, Townes and Porzingis.
*  It's a pretty, pretty good group of players, right?
*  So now we have all these advanced metrics you can look at too, right?
*  We can, we can study his post-ups now his post-ups.
*  It's a little bit of a cheat code here because one of the things the Celtics love
*  to do, if you guard Porzingis with a small, they're just like, no, you're not
*  doing that.
*  And they'll post them up at the foul line.
*  They'll figure out some way to abuse the guy.
*  And it's very hard to put either your worst guy or smallest guy on Porzingis.
*  But that said, he's shooting 69% on post-ups this year.
*  They're averaging per 100 possessions, 1.42 per year.
*  1.42 points per 100, which compared to Giannis, he's at 1.03 on post-ups.
*  Yocage is 1.15 and Bede's 1.17.
*  Shangoon, the post-up master, he's 1.02.
*  So Porzingis is killing those guys.
*  Um, as a pick and roll man, which anyone who watches the Celtics team, we don't
*  understand why they don't run pick and rolls with white and Porzingis down the
*  stretch because it's effectively unstoppable.
*  And even in the Miami game on Sunday, they didn't do it as a pick and roll
*  guy, he shouldn't 55%, 1.31 points per 100 possessions.
*  Davis is 1.13 and Bede is 1.08.
*  And Yocage, the best player in the league, the master at this is 1.29.
*  So they're doing slightly better with Porzingis and pick and rolls than
*  Denver is doing with Yocage, who is the best player in the league.
*  Um, he's played 10 playoff games total.
*  There's a very good chance he could get hurt at some point.
*  Every Celtics fan has their finger crossed, but when you look at the
*  numbers and you look at the body of work, like this isn't Fluky.
*  He is this good offensively and he's been an amazing team karma guy too.
*  So as we open the six pack here, I just want to point out Porzingis.
*  He's not going to make the all-star team.
*  Probably had a case to be at least a bubble guy.
*  Uh, but he's the super, the super cheat code of this Celtic season.
*  All right.
*  Speaking of cheat codes, Giannis, he's my, my second thing I want to talk about.
*  I don't know if he saw the Bucs played Denver last night, but the Bucs looked
*  really good.
*  The chemistry looked good from an eye test standpoint.
*  They're just defensively.
*  They just seem to finally all seem to understand what the other person's doing.
*  Uh, all the stuff the Bucs fans were complaining about my friend, Ben Thompson,
*  where they were just like, our team's a mess.
*  We're completely disheveled.
*  We, we cannot figure out our defensive identity at all.
*  What happened to us, uh, combined with the unhappiness that I saw in person in a
*  couple of games that people have been talking about, it feels like that cloud is
*  lifted.
*  And I was watching for this because obviously Doc Rivers took over who he left
*  the podcast and he left the ESPN and he went back to his coaching lifestyle.
*  I was hurt.
*  You know, I'm an only child.
*  I don't like to be abandoned, but, um, but I also want him to do well as long as
*  he's not playing the Celtics in a playoff series.
*  And there were signs of life even during the one through five, when, when they
*  went one and five in the first six, I know I did a joke about the Bucs panic
*  tweet, but that's been a running joke for me on Twitter.
*  I wanted to see last night because last night was a good test for them.
*  What are they going to do against Denver?
*  How are they going to handle the pick and roll with Yoko Chimurri?
*  How are they going to jump out on shooters?
*  What's the pace of the game going to be like?
*  And they answered every question.
*  I mean, going into the weekend, they were plus one six to win their division.
*  Cleveland was the heavy favorite.
*  Cleveland's coming off that big wind streak.
*  Uh, were they, if you look closely, they beat Brooklyn twice, Washington three
*  times, San Antonio twice, they went two and one against the Bucs right as the
*  Bucs were imploding and everybody's like, Oh, Cleveland's Cleveland's the
*  favorite in that division.
*  I still think the Bucs should be the favorite right now.
*  The Bucs are plus one 15.
*  And by the way, if you parlay that with Dallas's division odds, that gets over
*  four to one, just going to throw that out.
*  The bigger one to me is Yannis and his MVP odds.
*  Yannis is plus six 50.
*  I'm not allowed to bet on this word, but if they end up being the two seat, if
*  they can rally here, which I think is, is possible, um, and they have a better
*  record than anyone in the West.
*  Cause right now it looks like the top two teams in the East, maybe even in the
*  top three, you could have better records than anybody in the West.
*  Well, Yannis he's played 52 games already.
*  He's averaging a 31 11 and six, two and a half stocks a game, 61%.
*  Uh, field goal.
*  He's plus 8.1 net rating when he's on off court.
*  Got his coach fired.
*  I mean, he at least had a hand in it, which if you're watching just the difference
*  of how they looked last night versus how they looked the rest of the season.
*  Maybe he had some good ideas there if he had ideas, I'm not accusing him, but come
*  on, uh, he also plays the hardest of any one in the league.
*  He really does.
*  If they, now they give out the stupid clutch award, but they should really give
*  out the who played the hardest this year award, because I think Yannis would win
*  as I joked about last week in the trade value, he's a borderline sociopath with
*  these games.
*  So you, you add all this together.
*  They're 35 and 19, their fourth in offense, 17 in defense.
*  Uh, and that should probably get read or better for net rating.
*  After the break, they play at Minnesota and at Philly.
*  And those would be the two big questions because I want to see how they defend
*  Anthony Edwards.
*  I still am not sure they can defend links.
*  I like the Beverly trade.
*  You can feel it last night.
*  And then him and Bobby poured us together.
*  It's just the right kind of crazy coming off the bench, little irrational
*  confidence, a little crazy, little feisty.
*  This team needed an identity change and it feels like they're a little closer
*  to where they were a couple of years ago.
*  So watch out for the bucks would be my, my second big point.
*  Um, all right.
*  Third.
*  So this is a quick one, but have you noticed how with sports ratings, everybody's
*  sports ratings are up on TV.
*  Like we just had the Superbowl came out.
*  It was the most watched Superbowl ever.
*  123 million.
*  It's like, man, that, that seems weird because I thought people under 25 were on
*  TikTok and on YouTube and, uh, on Snapchat and on all the streaming services, you
*  have so many more TV choices.
*  Why would the ratings go up?
*  And then you see like ESPN they do at the end of the year or the end of the month,
*  be like highest ratings ever for get up and all these different shows.
*  Same for Fox.
*  All their shows are up.
*  Everybody's ratings are basically up except for the NBA and whoever replaced
*  the 12 PM sports center.
*  Uh, if your ratings don't go up, it's probably a bad sign, but I couldn't figure
*  out why are the ratings up?
*  So I asked John Arand who covers sports stuff.
*  He used to be at sports business general.
*  Now he's a puck.
*  I was like, what's going on here?
*  This is the very short thumbnail version.
*  I'm sure there's a better, longer, uh, deeper dive version of this.
*  He should write it.
*  John, write this for puck.
*  Um, they measuring these at home ratings, which has been this new trend this
*  decade and their base, they've expanded them and they did this during COVID.
*  So it didn't have an effect right away.
*  But at some point they changed the ratings to reflect, you know, if you're
*  watching in a bar, if, if you're watching in an airport, if you're watching
*  at somebody's house, they basically changed the mechanics of it.
*  So John estimated the ratings are like 10 and 20% higher.
*  Right?
*  So there's one thing.
*  The second thing is the suit, like the super bowl was on CBS and it was on
*  Paramount plus, and it was on Nickelodeon.
*  Uh, Monday night football was on ESPN one and two.
*  You get to add those together and it was on ABC sometimes, and it was on ESPN plus.
*  So they get to add all these ratings together.
*  Of course the ratings are up for everything.
*  Like if, if we had in, in the playoffs, it's like 20, or I'm sorry, in the NBA,
*  uh, 28 footers are, are now worth five points and everybody in the NBA, their
*  points went up like, like 10% because of these five pointers and then the Milwaukee
*  Bucks, the depress release our points per game are up 12%.
*  It's the most points we've ever scored.
*  It's like, yeah, cause you're counting five pointers now, but whatever's going
*  on with this at home thing seems to be the five pointer of, of this whole.
*  Whatever.
*  But if I'm the NBA, I'm like, man, we have all these different ways to boost the
*  ratings and our ratings aren't even going that well, I would be very concerned.
*  I would be trying to get that.
*  Media red steel done as fast as I possibly could.
*  Um, been talking about the soup.
*  This is the fourth thing.
*  They're talking about the super bowl.
*  OTE decision that Shanahan had.
*  Sal and I were both in the camp when we did the podcast on Sunday night of I
*  can't believe they took the ball.
*  They should have gone second.
*  There's been a lot of stuff written about this since I've been on some arguments
*  on text ESPN's Brian Burke, who's who crunches those numbers, like here's
*  this scenario, here's that scenario.
*  He said it was basically 50.2 to 50.3% odds to get the ball first.
*  So basically nothing that's a coin flip.
*  Um, Shanahan was saying they wanted it because if you get the ball third,
*  meaning if the two teams match scores, you get the ball third.
*  Now you have the advantage.
*  That makes sense on paper.
*  Here's the case for going second.
*  And I didn't fully realize this in my head for a couple of days as I was
*  arguing with people.
*  So if you go second, you can get a stop or a turnover right on the other team's
*  first drive and get the ball.
*  Now you have a chance to win the game.
*  That's one thing.
*  You can match a field goal.
*  You can match a TD.
*  That's the second thing.
*  You can score a touchdown and go for a two point to just try to win it, which
*  the chiefs, if you read any or heard anything that of them talking, heading
*  into that game, they had all these two point plays ready to go because just in
*  case there was an overtime, because if they went second, which they wanted to,
*  they're going to go for the win when they had the ball.
*  But there's like a, like a mental aspect to this too.
*  And the best way I can describe it as this, you're playing blackjack.
*  You could basically mirror what the dealer does, right?
*  You could just do every single thing.
*  Like the dealer does.
*  You can just keep hitting until you get to 17.
*  You can stop it at 17.
*  Like, but for some reason, the blackjack wins more than the person playing.
*  Well, why is that?
*  Two reasons.
*  One, the person playing is going first.
*  So they have a chance to screw up or get too aggressive or whatever.
*  And the dealer can basically win by doing nothing.
*  And then second, there's the psychological advantage.
*  When you're going first, you don't know what the dealer has.
*  So you're just trying to, well, I gotta be aggressive.
*  He's showing a nine.
*  I get, and then you, you're kind of falling out of maybe the right way to play a hand.
*  Going second in this is you're the blackjack dealer.
*  No matter what happens, you're kind of psyching out the other team.
*  And even like the Niners not going for it on fourth and four and settling for the field goal.
*  You could argue like, if they had to do that, do that over again, would they have gone for it on fourth and four there?
*  Knowing that my homes was waiting, knowing the inevitability of, oh my God, we just gave Patrick bombs a ball and he'd feel goal ties touchdown wins.
*  What did we just do?
*  I think going second makes you the blackjack dealer.
*  That's my thought.
*  Speaking of my homes, there's been a lot of Brady, my home stuff.
*  I got to defend my guy, Brady for a split second here.
*  Brady went to 10 super bowls and he won seven.
*  Brady won 19 of 22 division titles.
*  Brady went 35 and 13 in the playoffs and had 13 first round buys, which means if you're just saying playoff round advancements, he advanced 48 times.
*  I really want to see somebody beat that in my lifetime.
*  Brady beat my homes twice in the playoffs in 2018 in the Superbowl.
*  And my homes is 15 and three in the playoffs.
*  He's got six to six division titles for first round by.
*  So he's 19 advances.
*  So he's 29 advances behind Brady.
*  He's on a great pace.
*  Kudos to Patrick my homes.
*  But Tom Brady, the goat thing shouldn't be in this play.
*  My homes is on Brady's corner.
*  And that's it.
*  Brady from 2014 to 2020, which is the same timeframe right now as my homes.
*  He won four Superbowls, three Superbowl MVP, one MVP and beat my homes twice.
*  And this was in the last part of his career.
*  So everybody settled the fuck down.
*  Um, what I do think is in play is best decade to start a career.
*  And this is something Justin Termini texted me about this yesterday.
*  I've always had this day with Larry Bird.
*  His first nine years, I think is the greatest start to a career in the history of the NBA.
*  His first nine years, three titles, five finals, three MVPs, two finals MVPs in the MVP voting his first nine years, including his rookie year, fourth, second,
*  second, second, first, first, first, third, second.
*  There was literally never a point after his rookie year when he wasn't one of the three best players in the league and his rookie year is the fourth best player in the league.
*  He also should have won the 1981 MVP, which I covered in my book.
*  Him and Dr.
*  J were dead even last game in the season, which basically if we covered the NBA back then, like we do now, we would have said, whoever wins this wins the MVP.
*  Well, Boston blew out Philly.
*  So Doc, I think people love Doc and they just want to give him one.
*  Bird was 25, 10 and six over that nine years and 50%, 38%, 88%.
*  And it's just like, you can't do better than that for your first nine years as a basketball player.
*  Wayne Gretzky, I think we count the WHA year.
*  We have to, but then he won eight straight MVPs.
*  Seems irrelevant.
*  Four cups, six finals.
*  He won nine of 10 MVPs his first 10 years in the NHL.
*  Eight straight scoring titles broke every record.
*  So he's got to be in the mix.
*  Tiger Woods, PGA player there eight times from 9707 plus he won an 09.
*  He was the money winner nine times from 9709 and he won 14 majors from 97 to 2008.
*  And then Montana, who I forgot didn't start for two years.
*  So it's a little tougher for him, but from 81 to 89, four Superbowls, 14 and four in the playoffs.
*  Anyone won MVP.
*  And then last but not least the GOAT, Bill Russell, who came into the league, won a title his first year and won 11 of 13.
*  Won a bunch of MVPs was the dominant player of an entire generation.
*  Also coached the team for the last two titles.
*  So I'm still going to say Bill Russell, best start to a career ever because the start, middle and end was the best.
*  But Mahomes has it, what's happening with Mahomes, you throw away his rookie year because he didn't play.
*  But now he's in this.
*  You know, it's, it's two more years like this.
*  He's at least in the conversation now for one of the best starts to a career in any team sport.
*  And let's say he wins two more Superbowls.
*  He might be like the second or third person mentioned.
*  So that was more interesting to me.
*  I'm not ready to have the Brady discussion yet.
*  He's certainly on pace, but let's see it happen for 50 more years.
*  Let's see you have a 2014 to 2020 version of the third part of your career.
*  Like Tom Brady did.
*  Last but not least.
*  This is a quickie, but Victor Rambanama.
*  I try not to watch the Spurs.
*  I really, they make me so mad.
*  It makes me so mad.
*  They didn't get a point card for him.
*  Here's the thing.
*  He's hitting every checkpoint we would have wanted from him.
*  Right.
*  If you look at just the last, uh, his, his 2024 stats.
*  Just January and February, he's averaging a 23 and 10, 3.3 blocks a game.
*  50% shooting.
*  It's a good free throw shooter already, which I wasn't expecting.
*  He's 83% from the lander in that stretch.
*  He can hit threes.
*  That'll get better.
*  Uh, the worst part of his game, the pull up jumper stuff, he still hasn't really
*  figured out how to punish people the way like somebody like Porzingis does on
*  Boston when there's a smaller person.
*  But you know, he's a baby, he's 20 years old.
*  I think he's a legitimate defensive player of the year candidate.
*  Michael Pena threw this out on Twitter yesterday.
*  Kevin O'Connor agreed.
*  I would also like to agree.
*  I don't know if he should win, but I think he's now in the conversation.
*  And then you think 22 and under guys, uh, all time who averaged 20 and
*  10 with three blocks a game.
*  That list looks like 1974, Bob McNeil, 93 Shaq, 93 and 94 Alonzo
*  Mourning and 86 Hakim and probably 1970 Korean, but we didn't keep blocks back then.
*  Uh, the point is he's hitting all the check marks and you think back,
*  LeBron as a rookie, I remember writing a rookie column about him for his
*  pen, the magazine, like halfway in.
*  I'm like, LeBron's delivering the goods, man.
*  This is great.
*  Hey, I love what I'm seeing.
*  This he's hitting the checkpoints.
*  MJ is a rookie.
*  He's a little bit older.
*  He's 22, but he averaged 28 his game as a rookie.
*  And we knew almost instantaneously.
*  This guy has it.
*  I think people felt that way about well, who was, I think 23 when he came in the
*  league Shaq's first year, I felt that way.
*  Tim Duncan, who had four years in college, same thing, but with Wemba
*  Niyama, um, if you were like, all right, he's not going to have a point guard
*  and his team's going to suck.
*  Are we still going to feel good about this heading into the All-Star break?
*  I feel fantastic.
*  And I might actually start watching the Spurs, even though they infuriate me
*  with the team they put around him.
*  But where does this go?
*  What is, you think like this is the floor, the floor for him or the last six weeks,
*  23 and 10, 3.3 blocks a game.
*  So where does this go?
*  Wait, year four is it 30 and 15 with five blocks a game.
*  It's almost like a house without a ceiling.
*  That's Victor Wemba Niyama.
*  So that's it.
