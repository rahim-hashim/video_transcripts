# The Cavs Why Is Everyone Sleeping On Them? (Plus More NBA Questions)  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [January 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8)
*  I sent you a bunch of NBA stuff because this is a weird inflection point of the season right now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=0.0s)]
*  with awards, with odds, with conference stuff. And I was going through it this morning and I was [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=4.8s)]
*  really surprised by some of the odds for things. The first thing was the title odds where Boston [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=10.4s)]
*  and OKC are right where you would think Boston's plus 200, OKC's plus 250. The fact that the Knicks [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=17.12s)]
*  had better title odds than Cleveland, I was kind of shocked by the Knicks are 10 to one, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=23.68s)]
*  Cleveland's 11 to one. And then after that, it's Denver 15 to one, Dallas 17 to one. That's [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=28.32s)]
*  what they have in these futures. There's legacy stuff from the start of the season. They can't [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=33.2s)]
*  like jack them around too much. And then we'll go through some of the other ones later. But [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=37.2s)]
*  I was really surprised Cleveland isn't being treated more favorably by the odds community. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=42.4s)]
*  What else do people need to see from this team? Because right now they're 29 and four. They're [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=50.24s)]
*  over on our Fandel for wins for the season is 61 and a half. I don't know. They're probably [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=56.08s)]
*  going to have home court advantage around one round, two round three. What don't people trust? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  What is your opinion on this? Their performance in the playoffs. I mean, this is exactly why [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=67.2s)]
*  the Knicks are ahead of them. We watch these two teams, slightly different composition, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=72.96s)]
*  but Cleveland, you know, largely the same team as last year, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=79.28s)]
*  perform in the, in the most recent playoffs and Cleveland didn't knock anybody's socks off. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=84.08s)]
*  And the Knicks were unbelievable. They were, you know, an injury issue away from being in the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=89.36s)]
*  Eastern conference finals. It felt like the Knicks slightly different Knicks team. I would say [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=97.28s)]
*  slightly different calves team, because they've got a totally different version of Garland this [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=102.56s)]
*  year. Now that he's healthy, Mowgli went up a level, a new coach who I think has made a real [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=106.8s)]
*  difference for them. That's and over and over again, they just answered these tests. I don't [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=112.88s)]
*  know if you saw any of the Warriors game the other night, but they just, you know, they're just [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=116.64s)]
*  slaughtering teams. They're not, it's very similar to what was happening with the Celtics last year. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=122.08s)]
*  And I, you know, they're plus 11. I think they're plus like 11, three rating. They're killing teams. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  They're up by 20 in a lot of these games. And it was like last year where people didn't trust it [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=133.36s)]
*  with the Celtics for a while. And then eventually they trusted it. I, maybe I trusted too much with [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=137.68s)]
*  them, but I, I'm, I really believe, I think they have as good of a chance as anybody. And I don't [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=142.48s)]
*  understand the odds. Well, part of the thing with Cleveland, I think they're the only team in the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=147.2s)]
*  NBA that is undefeated against teams that are 500 or worse, which is exactly what you want. Right? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=151.68s)]
*  That's a hallmark benchmark kind of a level of achievement when you play in regular season. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=158.16s)]
*  Yeah. They're worse than you in the regular season. You're supposed to beat their ass. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=163.44s)]
*  And that's how you build up a great regular season record. And that's how you put yourself [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=166.72s)]
*  in a driver's seat in terms of a, you know, home court advantage throughout the playoffs. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=171.44s)]
*  I just think it's, it's fair where these odds are because when do we get to see [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=179.28s)]
*  some of the true sort of leverage moments this team put under stress and duress. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=187.52s)]
*  Now, the thing that, that could, if you wanted to talk yourself into the value proposition, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=193.84s)]
*  Kenny Atkinson has all the chops. He has the pedigree with the, the warriors being, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=199.76000000000002s)]
*  you know, along for that ride. Yeah. He knows exactly how a good organization he, he took, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=206.8s)]
*  you know, the nets and was really competitive with the nets before he fell out of favor. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=212.8s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. But I mean that that team overachieved that next team. And so, you know, he was, he, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=219.36s)]
*  we in our analysis of how this Cavalier season might go when we were together in October, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  thought that he more than any other element to that team could be a real elevating force. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=233.52s)]
*  And that's exactly what's happened. Yeah. And we, and we, we trusted the Garland [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=239.68s)]
*  comeback year. We trusted the stability with Mitchell and the big X factor was what's [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=244.4s)]
*  Mowgli got for us this year. Right. Mowgli went up a level and he's hitting threes better. And I, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=249.44s)]
*  you know, I think, I think he should be in the all-star team. Even if you look at their last [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=254.56s)]
*  20 games, their net, their net ratings, 11.9 heading into Thursday night and the weekend [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=258.64s)]
*  and the Cleveland, OKC, Boston, the Knicks and the Grizzlies are all nine and above [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=265.12s)]
*  in that rating the last 20 games. And Memphis is the one I could see more confusion about Memphis, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=272.23999999999995s)]
*  whether what's real, what's not real with them, just because it doesn't, you know, Morant, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=278.4s)]
*  I want to see if he can, can you just play for a solid month and a half and just be out there [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=284.23999999999995s)]
*  every day. They've had some, some, some good schedule luck so far. We'll see if that exists, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=288.88s)]
*  but right now they're building such a big nest egg. Like they're 23 and 11 right now. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=295.04s)]
*  Yeah. They're over under is 51 and a half on Fandall, which 51 and a half. That means you [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=301.04s)]
*  have to go 52 and 30. So to me, that's a little bit of a, of a, of a lack of a trust, I think from, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=306.0s)]
*  from the betting community, at least with them, there's some weird ones though, like, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=314.96s)]
*  like the Knicks being 10 to one makes sense to me. That seems like the right range for them. Right. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=318.64s)]
*  Denver is 15 to one. I think just because of the legacy of what people bet before the season, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  same for Dallas 17 to one. But if you go a little further and you dig in, like Memphis is 27 to one, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=330.79999999999995s)]
*  Houston's 44 to one, Memphis and Houston are going to be probably be top four seeds. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=336.32s)]
*  So when you just look at it like that, you're like, how do those people have way worse odds [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=342.48s)]
*  than Denver? A team that just seems like a mess night tonight is even though Yocan is as great as [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=346.48s)]
*  he's been. What do you think of the Clippers at 75 to one to win the title? Nah, just a complete, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=351.28s)]
*  didn't even make you stop for a second. No, I'm not saying they're going to win the title. It just [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=358.71999999999997s)]
*  seemed like those odds seem really high to me. The one that caught my attention. And I mean, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=362.4s)]
*  all due respect to the Clippers. Great job by them. And I know this is going to run contrary to [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=367.44s)]
*  some action that we got down last week. Minnesota at 30 to one, we're finally at a number for them [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=374.0s)]
*  where it's like, wait a minute. I mean, that team was in the Western Conference finals last year. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  And they have a super duper star on their team. This first stretch of games, the first third of [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=386.40000000000003s)]
*  the season for them, you know, 17 and 15 through 32 games, not up to the level that we might've [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=392.4s)]
*  anticipated in the least. Well, we thought there would be some depth that was added. What the, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=402.79999999999995s)]
*  the Carl Anthony Towns piece we were saying, well, maybe it won't really affect the defense that much [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=410.23999999999995s)]
*  and on what they get in terms of offensive versatility. Yeah. Maybe their shooting won't [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=417.36s)]
*  go down. But yeah, it did affect them all over the place. In every, which way, having said all of [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=422.24s)]
*  that, I mean, 30 to one, they're there. They still have Anthony Edwards. They still have the, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=428.56s)]
*  the only way that makes sense to me is if you're assuming that there's a Randall trade out there [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=436.16s)]
*  for them, that they can turn him into something else. Cause the thing that's changed the last [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=441.36s)]
*  couple of weeks is deep in chenzo finally got going. Yeah. And that's added all the stuff we [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=446.0s)]
*  thought he was going to add before that trade. And, uh, the athletic John Krasinski wrote a really [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=451.2s)]
*  good piece about it. Just like, you know, we always forget the human elements sometimes with, with [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=455.36s)]
*  these NBA trades and Dante was just fucking bummed out the first month and a half of the season. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=461.2s)]
*  Like he wanted to be on the Knicks. He had, he had had a great run with him. It was the best [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=467.12s)]
*  professional run of his career. Now he's on this weird Minnesota team and he just didn't play well [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=471.6s)]
*  and he didn't look like he was happy reinvested himself. And now he's added a little something. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=476.0s)]
*  I'll be interested to see with Dillingham, what they get out of him too. If he, if he's just, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=480.8s)]
*  you know, him and Reed Shepard are kind of the two X factors of these rookies on good teams that [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=486.24s)]
*  don't really play. Right. And Reed Shepard hasn't been good either. I think Dillingham has been good [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=490.32000000000005s)]
*  in spots, but I'm just wondering what happens with those guys down the stretch. So the Rockets are [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=496.08000000000004s)]
*  another one at 44 to one that just like, if you're just factoring in a trade and you can, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=501.52s)]
*  can they turn Van Vliet or Jalen ground or Jalen green into a much better version of those guys [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=509.44s)]
*  than maybe those odds go up, but I don't sense the appetite from them this year, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=517.1999999999999s)]
*  making a major move. So we'll see. Um, and then Orlando at 43 to one is the only other one, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=523.12s)]
*  just cause they'll have their guys back at some point, the infrastructure they have, uh, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=528.48s)]
*  with the defense and the coaching and the, the reps that they've been getting for dudes like [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=533.6s)]
*  the Silva, Anthony black and people like that. So, you know, I, to me, the best odds are Cleveland [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=538.32s)]
*  11 to one. I'll go along with that. I don't have any argument with that. They're favored in the [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=546.8000000000001s)]
*  first two rounds. It's probably going to be, um, I don't know that whoever it is in round three, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=550.88s)]
*  and it might not be my team, but game seven will be in Cleveland. That's not nothing. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=558.64s)]
*  So a couple of over-unders really quick Celtics, 59 and a half just seems way too high. They're [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=563.92s)]
*  24 and nine. Um, that 59 and a half basically is 23 losses. That's 14 more the rest of the way. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=569.2s)]
*  They can't seem to get anybody healthy. I also don't really think they care about the one seed. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=576.8s)]
*  Golden state is still 45 and a half and they're 16 and 16 heading into tonight. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=581.44s)]
*  What, what world are they winning 46 games? Unless there's a major trade coming that I can't [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=587.36s)]
*  anticipate. It's that there is some, uh, possibility, I guess that, that the market thinks that there's [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=592.4s)]
*  a trade for them yet. You have to come to be really hard. It is a hard under for me. Yeah. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=600.24s)]
*  That's a hard under for me. I mean, go ahead. Well, just Clippers 46 and a half. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=606.0s)]
*  That would make me blink just because of the injury potential. The miles are putting on [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=612.72s)]
*  hard end. I don't know what they're getting from quiet when he comes back, but the golden state [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=616.72s)]
*  one, right? I don't see that we're already in on indie 43 and a half. We did the over, even though [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=620.24s)]
*  they're 16, 18, they're minus two 50 to make the playoffs. Um, Minnesota, you mentioned [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=624.96s)]
*  they're minus three 40 to make the playoffs right now, even though they're 17 and 15. So I think [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=630.96s)]
*  people are agreeing with the way you saw big picture what's happening with them, but they're [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=637.0400000000001s)]
*  over unders 47 and a half now, which seems too high to me. It's high. That's high. That's a tough [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=642.5600000000001s)]
*  stretch. Yeah. That, that means they'd have to go 31 and like 19 rest of the way, something like [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=647.6800000000001s)]
*  that. 31 and 18. I don't see it. Okay. See 62 and a half is the over under now they're 27 and five. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=655.36s)]
*  I think they get it. I would still, I would still be bullish on that. Wouldn't you? Sure. It's fine. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=662.8000000000001s)]
*  I feel like it's shocking every time they lose. They just so deep. We're already like fully [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=668.8000000000001s)]
*  subscribed, fully allocated on every okay. See, but if you wanted to just see for fun, you know, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=673.92s)]
*  another little bit to get down, will they get to 63 wins? It feels totally plausible. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=680.16s)]
*  63 and 19. Sure. It feels mid sixties to me unless there's another entry. Plus they haven't even [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=685.36s)]
*  gotten chip back. So here are the two hardest for me. Phoenix was 45 and a half right now. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=692.5600000000001s)]
*  They're minus one 34 to make the playoffs. So people are putting a lot of faith into [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=699.12s)]
*  something turning around here. They're 15 and 17. I just like even their last 20 games, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=703.36s)]
*  they're six and 14. They're minus 3.1 net rating. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=711.44s)]
*  We really need this. This would be the first boost season boost that we've lost. We had our [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=719.0400000000001s)]
*  boost this year was Cleveland and Phoenix to win 45 plus. Okay. See to win 55 plus. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=724.1600000000001s)]
*  And that's what we boosted on Fando. We're going nuts for it. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=729.9200000000001s)]
*  I don't know if Phoenix gets to 45 wins. Do you, do you see it? What's missing with them other than [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=733.7600000000001s)]
*  they have the worst centers in the league? Yeah. I, we really, I think believed that the [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=738.56s)]
*  coaching change and what they'd be able to do from the perimeter, especially like, you know, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=747.76s)]
*  that they would change what they had, what the, the single biggest problem was a math problem, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=754.2399999999999s)]
*  which was they, they didn't get up enough threes and it didn't make enough threes. And we say, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=758.64s)]
*  okay, bud is going to come and change that. And, and they're going to be this high scoring, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=762.2399999999999s)]
*  like super fun entertaining team that just is winning 120 to 115. And they're not that. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=767.92s)]
*  Now, and they, and the problem is, you know, it's kind of the same problem as last year. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=774.88s)]
*  When they were a great underplay, Durant can't really play night to night and it really doesn't [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=780.3199999999999s)]
*  make sense for him to play night to night. And they just rotate two out of the three guys. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=786.56s)]
*  And you know, Beal, Beal doesn't move the needle. He doesn't help them win basketball games. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=791.76s)]
*  Putting up stats lately and it doesn't perfectly fine. Right. Exactly. They're, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=797.92s)]
*  they're three and seven over the last 10 and he's, he's in all of those games. So, you know, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=802.16s)]
*  you know what they're the big picture front office mistake they made was they tried to put together [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=808.0799999999999s)]
*  this big three model, which had been so successful in the late two thousands and the 2010s because [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=813.92s)]
*  the league wasn't as deep. Now the league is deep. You need depth. You need the ability to [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=819.04s)]
*  weather an injury for 10 games. You need random guys stepping up night to night. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=826.4s)]
*  And I just don't know if that big three model works. Great. Cool. You have three really good [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=831.6800000000001s)]
*  players. It doesn't matter. Like you're competing against other teams that have seven, eight, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=836.32s)]
*  nine players that have real depth. That was something the Quippers figured out when they [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=840.64s)]
*  miraculously didn't offer Paul George that fourth year and landed all these other dudes. And now [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=844.5600000000001s)]
*  they have depth and they have the ability to, you know, weather Kawhi not playing for [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=849.0400000000001s)]
*  two and a half months because they have enough guys. So, uh, that's a hard under for me. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=854.8s)]
*  And I think we're going to lose our bet. And I'm bummed because I, that was one of my favorite [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=860.16s)]
*  streaks that we had going. The other one, San Antonio is 39 and a half and that's up four wins [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=863.68s)]
*  from where we were the start of the season. They're 17 and 16. They're plus three 60 to make the [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=869.92s)]
*  playoffs. And what we've seen from Wemby Goldspar and I talked about it a little on Tuesday. Like [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=875.68s)]
*  he's basically 29 and 12 every night now with four blocks, whatever it is, and is turning into this [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=882.0s)]
*  crunch time dude. And they have trades to make potentially if they want, they want to add another [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=888.24s)]
*  guy. I kind of like the plus three 60 for the playoffs for them as a flyer. Oh, okay. I don't [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=892.8000000000001s)]
*  know if they're going to make the playoffs. I just like the odds. Let's look at this real quick. So [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=899.12s)]
*  where they're sitting right now is they're in the nine hole. Yeah. Uh, and so let's see who they [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=903.9200000000001s)]
*  have to climb over. So the Lakers would have to drop, which I think, I really think I could see [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=911.52s)]
*  that happening. That's not crazy talk. And then, uh, and that would be the team. They'd have to [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=916.3199999999999s)]
*  jump the Lakers basically. And then you'd have to assume Phoenix, Sacramento, golden state, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=923.68s)]
*  those teams, they had to beat those teams as well. I'm not saying it's going to happen. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=929.6s)]
*  Plus three 60 though. I just think they're put a four to one chance of it happening basically seems [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=933.68s)]
*  reasonable to me considering they have a guy who is now like a top seven or eight guy. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=939.04s)]
*  I like this. Let's, let's fire on it. Let's take a break in this podcast. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=943.1999999999999s)]
*  A couple other ones. So MVP is basically a two horse race, SGA minus one Oh five, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=949.1999999999999s)]
*  Yoke edge plus one 15. And I think if okay, C is in the, in the mid sixties for winds and [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=954.3199999999999s)]
*  SGA is doing the stuff he's been doing all year and Denver is like a seven seed, you know, 45 win [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=961.28s)]
*  team. SGA is going to win. I think if the way it's going now, I think SGA wins. And I was [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=967.68s)]
*  surprised the odds were even where'd you stand on that? Well, I totally agree with the way that [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=974.56s)]
*  you're approaching this. And I also want to get down on this, um, a sizable number because I don't [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=979.28s)]
*  see, uh, Oklahoma city backing up or, you know, I'm not going to wood. I mean, it would, it would [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=984.8s)]
*  have to be some kind of crazy injury situation. I mean, wait, wait till Chet comes back, right? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=989.92s)]
*  Wait, wait till they really have their, their whole team. Um, the reason that I think it's, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=994.24s)]
*  it's especially compelling with SGA is because it addresses the thing that you and I talked about, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=999.04s)]
*  uh, over the last couple of weeks, which is this transition moment for the league. The league [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1004.72s)]
*  really needs to start marketing the new class of stars that it has. And SGA should be a face of [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1009.52s)]
*  the league. Um, he should be one of those guys. People need to see him. There needs to be some [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1017.92s)]
*  marketing around his, his campaign. He's winning the all-star vote right now, which I thought [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1023.12s)]
*  was a good sign. That's good. That's a good sign. Exactly. Right. Um, so even odds, and I actually [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1027.28s)]
*  think he should be favored by more. And if I was going to suggest anyone else, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1031.92s)]
*  look, I don't think he's going to win, but Wemby at 110 to one on Fandl. No, not, no, no. Listen, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1038.48s)]
*  110 to one. He, by the way, he has the fifth best odds on Fandl right now because it's SGA [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1045.12s)]
*  and Yokel. Yanis is plus nine 50 Tatum's 22 to one. And Wemby is 110 to one. You want to put $10 on [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1050.64s)]
*  it? Just, no, I'm not allowed to bet on the MVP. I'm just pointing out value. I'll put $10 on it [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1057.5200000000002s)]
*  just to like, you know, he's the one that they have to win 50 some games. They have to win. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1064.3200000000002s)]
*  I'm just trying to think of the last time the number five guy out of MVP was over a hundred to [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1067.8400000000001s)]
*  one because that's how dominant SGA and Yokel has been. But we know what the league like, you know, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1074.48s)]
*  SGA, he could get a dumb injury for four weeks. Yokel Denver could go slide backwards. Who knows? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1079.84s)]
*  Tatum 22 to one would be more fun if Boston was playing better. And we're going to find out with [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1086.32s)]
*  Boston on this road trip there on rookie of the year is a catastrophe. Zach, it is our favorite [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1090.3999999999999s)]
*  at plus one 20 Missy on a new Orleans is second now. And by the way, plays crunch time for them, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1096.3999999999999s)]
*  but it's a terrible team. Castle seven to one Wells is 10 to one. A research is 25 to one who [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1102.24s)]
*  would probably still be my pick because he's starting to play more and more from them just [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1107.84s)]
*  for the odds. But I don't know who's going to win that. I thought, did you see Tom Haberstro's [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1111.6799999999998s)]
*  breakdown just in the last like 24, 48 hours of it's very good. He does. There's a bunch of clips [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1117.04s)]
*  and with, with, with the numbers, the plus minus numbers for Edie have been outstanding. And there's [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1123.52s)]
*  a lot of good evidence about him, how active he is and how he's very quietly really propelling [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1128.08s)]
*  that team. And if Memphis, you know, over this stretch of, you know, jobbing week to week, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1133.76s)]
*  if they're sort of able to kind of tread water for a bit, I think in the, in the Edie's minutes are, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1140.8s)]
*  are still a relevant part of it. I think that's a pretty good bet at this stage, the plus one 20, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1145.92s)]
*  it's kind of my attention to be honest with you. Castle seven to one. I like to heat a little bit [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1151.76s)]
*  of a while the last couple of weeks, but I still like him longterm, but yeah, Edie, everything we [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1156.16s)]
*  thought before the draft of if he goes here, he's this really interesting piece in a nine man [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1160.8s)]
*  rotation that you can, and he's been everything, uh, the glass half full side of the Zach Edie [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1165.84s)]
*  argument. He said all of it, defensive player of the year, Wembe's minus two 70. I, for me, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1171.68s)]
*  it's like, if he's below minus 500 on that, just grab it. Go ahead and lay it. Um, most improved, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1177.76s)]
*  the two guys that jumped out were Jalen Johnson, three to one is the favorite, but Dyson Daniels, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1183.76s)]
*  a 10 to one who is probably the best perimeter defensive player we have. I was surprised 10 to [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1188.0s)]
*  one was as high as it was. And then, um, coach of the air, Kenny Atkins is favorite minus one 80, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1193.04s)]
*  mostly a plus nine 50 jumped out to me because that the fact that that team is five, six games [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1199.6s)]
*  over 500 with all the injuries they've had is, is, uh, is crazy to me. So anyway, that is, uh, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1205.52s)]
*  that is my way out of all those bets. We just talked about, what was your favorite? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1212.56s)]
*  Uh, the Oklahoma city over 62 and a half. Yeah, I think I'm with you. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1216.72s)]
*  It's like, we already have more than enough on them. Anyway, that is our little NBA chicken. All right. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYN_RCi3gQ8&t=1223.92s)]
