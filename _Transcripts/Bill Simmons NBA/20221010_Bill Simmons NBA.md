# Bill Simmons Is All In on Victor Wembanyama | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [October 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaNeHiTBdyw)
*  I don't know what we're going to end up calling Victor Wambanyama.
*  I wrote down some nicknames.
*  Ironically, I called him an alien on a tweet on Tuesday.
*  LeBron, they interviewed him after the Vegas game last night.
*  And LeBron said, LeBron compared him to an alien.
*  And the reason he did was because this guy is an alien.
*  We've never seen anything like this.
*  He's 7'4".
*  It feels like he's taller than 7'4".
*  He looks 7'5".
*  He moves in a way that is just so unusual for a tall guy.
*  The tall guys always look either a little clumsy, a little stiff.
*  Either they got the Holmgren thing where their back's a little bit up.
*  Just something's always...
*  This guy moves like he's 6'5".
*  I don't get it.
*  I don't understand it.
*  I don't understand the...
*  We'll get into all the checklist stuff.
*  But for nicknames, either we just call him Victor, call him alien or the alien.
*  I kind of like alien.
*  Could call him Predator too.
*  Call him UFO.
*  Call him VD the extraterrestrial.
*  It doesn't really matter.
*  The point is we have not had somebody like this lingering in front of a season, in front
*  of a draft, in front of a lottery in a long, long time.
*  I'm going to do a couple things here.
*  We're going to talk about the best center prospects ever first.
*  The best center prospect ever was Will Chamberlain.
*  Will Chamberlain didn't really belong in college.
*  They had all these rules back then where you had to stay four years.
*  He stayed, I think, three in Kansas.
*  Then he played for the Globetrotters.
*  He didn't enter the league until he was 23.
*  He could have come in in 19.
*  He would have been awesome.
*  So he's it's got to start with Wilt and then Kareem right behind him.
*  Kareem was 22 when he entered the league.
*  He was in UCLA for four years.
*  First year, couldn't even play as a freshman and was just absolutely, it was just clear
*  he would have been one of the best seven players in the NBA his last couple of UCLA years.
*  So he came in and he is now one of the three best players of all time.
*  Those two stand apart.
*  Now, both of those were before my time.
*  I was there for Patrick Ewing.
*  I was actually living in Boston with my dad when he was at Cambridge, Virginia, Latin,
*  and everybody thought he was Bill Russell.
*  He ends up going to Georgetown over BC.
*  People were furious, myself included.
*  I still like BC at the time.
*  His freshman year at Georgetown, don't look at the stats.
*  He was like 13 and eight with like three blocks a game.
*  There had never been anybody like that defensively since Russell on a college basketball court.
*  And I would say second year Ewing, or maybe one of those first two years was just clear.
*  It was like, what is the ceiling for this guy?
*  This guy is going to be one of the best 15 players ever.
*  His knees kind of went on him.
*  I think there's like almost two Ewing's.
*  There's like the eighties Ewing.
*  And then by the time we get into the nineties, when his knees are going, he's got those big,
*  those big knee pad things on.
*  Wasn't the same guy, but he is the best center prospect I've ever seen.
*  In my lifetime, Bill Walton, a lot of people would throw on there.
*  He obviously dominated it at UCLA and I revere that guy.
*  I had him in top 35 in my book, even though he had a couple of NBA seasons,
*  just everything you'd want from a center.
*  I was there for Hakeem and Ralph Sampson.
*  And Hakeem was just this ball of athletic.
*  You didn't even know what it was.
*  You knew it was something.
*  You didn't know if he was going to be able to put it together.
*  But athletically, we had not seen a center like that.
*  It was even unclear if he was the center.
*  He was just a six, six 10.
*  I don't know what.
*  And then as he developed the footwork as an NBA player,
*  I mean, it actually turned out even better than you might've thought.
*  To put Hakeem in perspective, he went first in the 84 draft.
*  MJ went third.
*  Nobody complains about this.
*  Hakeem was the right pick, even though MJ was third.
*  MJ should have been second.
*  Sampson was the other one.
*  And Sampson, as a high school player and a freshman,
*  had the same kind of buzz that I think we're going to get from Wemba Nyama.
*  There was a big Sports Illustrated cover where it was like,
*  Hi, I'm Ralph Sampson.
*  I'm a high school player or whatever.
*  I can't remember it, but it was like this iconic high school cover,
*  or SI cover.
*  And he goes to Virginia.
*  He's immediately good.
*  The Celtics are trying to get him because they have the first pick in the 1981 draft.
*  Red Arback is trying to convince them to come out.
*  And he ends up staying at Virginia.
*  Red Arback's furious.
*  They end up trading the pick for Kevin McHale and Robert Parrish.
*  Not a bad trade.
*  And Sampson stays all four years in college.
*  And it's a huge mistake.
*  Because he only plays a couple really, really good years for the Rockets
*  to make the finals in 86.
*  He gets hurt, but he's got to be in the conversation.
*  And then there's probably a slight drop off to Anthony Davis and Odin.
*  So I really have six great center prospects.
*  Will Karim, Ewing, Walton, Hakeem Sampson.
*  And with Wemba Nyama, the question is, is he the best guy since Karim?
*  And I actually think he is.
*  I watch both games.
*  I watch them intently.
*  I made a little checklist, like wow factor, 10.
*  Just a 10.
*  Just can't even believe what was going on with, with, uh, even the shots that he was missing.
*  He's missing like these Kevin Durant fallaways.
*  And, um, the fact that he's going up for alley-oops, he has to duck his head
*  because it's going to hit the rim.
*  I've been watching basketball my whole life.
*  I've never seen anything like this.
*  Even Sampson wasn't quite like this.
*  I'm going to call this the KG factor.
*  So KG was a tall guy.
*  KG was secretly seven one, but he carried himself like a six five guy.
*  You never felt like he was a tall guy.
*  He moved like a swing man.
*  He moved like a six five guy.
*  And when you think about the big centers, they all kind of move like centers.
*  This was the thing that always scared me about Greg Odin.
*  I didn't like watching him run.
*  He didn't, he seemed like a big body that didn't totally belong on a basketball court.
*  Womenama moves, moves like the same way Yanis does.
*  And some of these tall guys that the height almost doesn't matter, but it does matter
*  because he's seven foot five.
*  And the fluidness of, of just the way he moves at his age is just so unusual.
*  Like think about him compared to Hashim to beat some of these other big guys we've seen.
*  His fluidity is like a 100 out of a hundred.
*  I don't understand it.
*  I don't know where he came from.
*  Again, he might be an alien.
*  The competitiveness and the activeness I was really surprised by.
*  Like he dove for loose balls.
*  He's challenging everything.
*  His team was falling behind.
*  He would get mad.
*  He would start taking shots.
*  There's a nasty side to him.
*  Um, which I have mean streak as a 10 too, and the competitive activeness I also have
*  as a 10 scoot was the same way.
*  We'll talk about scoot in a second, but scoots like an alpha, like he's, you know, an aggro
*  dude.
*  And I, I think he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a,
*  I think that's a quality you just have to have if you're going to be great.
*  So, uh, when Badyama has that, the shop blocking 10 out of 10 is too low.
*  I it's like a 13 out of 10.
*  It's not just the shots he was blocking.
*  He's just there and it's changing every decision.
*  Everyone makes every floater, everybody near the basket, every, you get a pass, you
*  think you're gonna lay up, but you're like, where is he?
*  The where is he factor with him is a hundred out of 10.
*  Passing pretty good.
*  I, you know, he's not Bill Walton, but I thought, uh, he tried to be creative.
*  He definitely it's in there.
*  The rebounding I think was really good.
*  I think it will even get better.
*  And then the shot making I have as a nine and a half, he showed a variety of crazy
*  stuff.
*  Um, there was one in the first game where he got the ball on the left block.
*  He spun like he was going out of bounds.
*  Then he turned in and the guy and then fell back and did like a little one-handed off
*  the back, off the, off the backboard shot.
*  And it was like a Mikhail Hakim thing.
*  And I mean, if he starts doing that shit, Jesus, he also has 28 foot range, which we
*  should mention.
*  Um, the, the thing, the reason I have him is nine and a half and not a 10.
*  I didn't see a jump hook really with him.
*  And I was thinking like, if he develops a sky hook, cause this was that, that was
*  what made Kareem special.
*  Kareem was also seven foot four.
*  Kareem was also fluid like this guy was.
*  He was just an unbelievable athlete.
*  Never really got hurt other than when he broke his hand, when he punched camp
*  Benson who deserved it.
*  If he gets a sky hook or some semblance of a sky hook where he can just reach as
*  high up as possible and do the, do the art, the wrist flick, nobody's blocking it.
*  So I think that's what is so alarming about what we saw those two games.
*  It's like, this is the worst this guy's ever going to be.
*  So when we put this in perspective of like, you know, the best prospects ever, I'm
*  just going to my lifetime.
*  The last 30 years, this was the list I made.
*  Oh, three LeBron in high school.
*  He had everything.
*  Like there was just no doubt whatsoever that this was something different and
*  special and unique.
*  And he had size the way he saw his teammates, the explosiveness, the
*  athleticism, the unselfishness was really what was magical about him.
*  And it seemed like there was like a magic crossed with LeBron possibility with
*  him, even in high school.
*  And he was unforgettable.
*  I think Zion at Duke for me, where just athletically the wow factor with him,
*  much like one Benyama was a 10.
*  I'd have him second.
*  Durant in 07.
*  I was the leader of the Durant Bain wagon.
*  I was going crazy for him the entire season.
*  I had him over owed in that draft.
*  I was just like, I will bet my life.
*  This guy will be one of the great scorers we've ever had in the league.
*  Like, how can I bet this?
*  You obviously can't.
*  I have those three.
*  I have Duncan in 97.
*  I have Shaq in 92.
*  And I have C-Web in 93.
*  And those are the six best prospects I've ever seen.
*  I would have Wemba Nyama.
*  I think ahead of LeBron for just like, oh my God, what is this?
*  I don't see any way he's not an incredible player unless he gets hurt, but you could
*  say that about any, any player.
*  I mean, and maybe that's part of the magic with LeBron was that his size.
*  You would think like, well, this guy has a chance to be as durable as, as anybody.
*  There's just no way he's not going to be one of the best players in the league.
*  It's impossible.
*  He would have to get hurt from what we've seen at the age he's at.
*  He's 18.
*  So he's really, this would be going into his freshman year in college.
*  If he was an American, the stuff he's doing is just way ahead of the curve.
*  And I was thinking about just under 20 people I've seen in my lifetime.
*  I mentioned freshmen, I mentioned the first year.
*  I mentioned the first year.
*  In my lifetime, I mentioned freshmen, Patrick Ewing, Oh, seven Durant
*  C web who I think gets the short, the short stick on this stuff, because people
*  remember the NBA career and his NBA career was good, but also a little disappointing.
*  I value his NBA stuff.
*  I think a little higher than most, but the two Michigan years, that's the best power
*  forward prospect that I've ever seen.
*  It's still the best power forward prospect I've ever seen the passing, the athleticism,
*  the rebounding, the, he, he was a bad-ass.
*  The timeout really changed.
*  I think a little bit of his career.
*  We talked about it in the book of basketball pod, but that's best power forward prospect
*  I've ever seen.
*  Durant was the best shooter prospect I've ever seen.
*  Ewing was the best center prospect I've ever seen.
*  And LeBron was the best.
*  What the hell is this swing man prospect I've seen.
*  And I want to throw in Samson there as well, because Samson seemed like an evolutionary
*  Kareem when it was happening, especially those early Virginia years where it was like,
*  he actually wanted to be on the perimeter.
*  He wanted to be like, you know, run the offense from 25 feet away.
*  He wanted to shoot jump shots and he took a lot of shit for it.
*  He would make way more sense with the way basketball is played now, but really that's
*  the five freshmen Ewing, 07 Durant, 93 C-Web and freshman Ralph.
*  I guess that's four.
*  And then Wemba Yama would be five.
*  There's other guys that jumped out, but they were older like Bird and Magic and MJ,
*  but those guys had been in college for a couple of years.
*  For him to be where he's at at this point is just bonkers to me.
*  And I'm all in.
*  I don't know.
*  Like there's probably the stock is probably like Apple five years ago.
*  I don't care.
*  Buying all the stock.
*  It's the highest stock that we've probably ever had for an under 20 guy.
*  I don't care.
*  I'm all in.
*  If I was Utah, if I was San Antonio,
*  if I was Charlotte, if I was Indiana, if I was whatever team starts out slow
*  and didn't expect to, you know, not have that great of a season,
*  like maybe like a Washington, I don't know.
*  I'm all in.
*  I'm taking away.
*  I am.
*  I'm starting G League guys.
*  I'm doing weird shit.
*  I'm coming up with fake reasons guys aren't playing like COVID.
*  Oh, he got COVID again.
*  Yeah.
*  Test them and switching COVID tests.
*  Whatever I have to do.
*  So KOC asked me where Wemba Nyama would rank on the trade value list right now.
*  And I went through, I went through the list that I left off with in the summer,
*  which was Yanis was number one, then Luca, then Yokage, then Steph, Ja, Embiid, Tatum,
*  Edwards, Mobley.
*  Milwaukee is not trading Yanis for him.
*  Dallas is a trading Luca for him.
*  Denver is not trading Yokage for him.
*  So cross those three off.
*  Now, so what is the next meeting?
*  Golden state is having a seven hour meeting and actually it might be a two day meeting.
*  They might sleep in the office so they could have more of the meeting the next day.
*  And then ultimately they'll decide we can't trade Steph.
*  He is an absolute hero.
*  He's an icon.
*  He's the reason we're able to build this arena.
*  We're going to regretfully pass, but it will be a two day meeting guys.
*  We'll have BO in the office.
*  the place. One guy screaming, this is crazy. This guy's the future of basketball storming out.
*  But I think they keep Steph. Other than that, everyone trades their guy for women. Yama,
*  Jah and Bede, Tatum, Edwards, Mobley start packing. So I think he would be fifth on the
*  trade value list, even though he plays in France and is a year away from being in the league.
*  Scoot is also can't miss. I was thinking about can't miss swing guy like guard types like him.
*  You can see it. He got hurt in the second game, unfortunately, but in the first game,
*  the aggro quality of his game is just really jarring. Like guards aren't supposed to carry
*  themselves like this. It's very Jah Morantish, but he feels like he's just a little bigger than Jah.
*  He showed every single conceivable piece of an offensive game. He could shoot, he could drive
*  to the basket. He's a really good passer. So, you know, Luca, I was in on Luca that whole year.
*  Derrick Rose, Memphis Derrick Rose, I think I was probably a little higher on than others, but
*  athletically just clearly belonged. And then Iverson in 96, I would say it would be the three.
*  I'm not counting Zion because he was more of like a powerful than a guard swing guy. But,
*  you know, every time these guys come in, there's always like a couple things you can
*  poke holes at, right? Like even Paul Pierce, who was a really good college player, but he fell to
*  10 and it's like, is he too slow? What is this? Ray Allen was another one. Ray Allen was a can't
*  miss. This guy is going to come into the league and average 20 points a game. But it was like,
*  can he create his own shot? Scoot's going to have the ball a lot and he's going to be awesome.
*  And the great, great, great, great, great thing about this draft, which has only happened a couple
*  times in history is before the season has started, we know who the characters are.
*  I went back and tried to figure out when was the last time this happened? Well, in 2014,
*  we had Wiggins and Jabari. We tried to make that a thing. Neither of those guys were really that up
*  for it, but I went to the showcase game before the year there was a buzz and bead was there.
*  So we had it that year. Durant Oden, we had it the most famously. Oden was getting all the hype.
*  And then Durant just kicked ass at Texas and watching him at Texas was, I think the last
*  time I truly loved college basketball. I watched as many Texas games as possible. They were playing
*  him at center. He was just so good. And I'll never forgive Rick Barnes. Rick Barnes, you know what
*  you did. You sucked. 1997, there was a Duncan Keith Van Horn thing that developed during the year to
*  the point that people were wondering, should Keith Van Horn be the first pick? Which was a really
*  good litmus test for whether you were a moron or not. The answer was no, he shouldn't. Shaq
*  Mourning was a thing in 93, especially as the year developed. Mourning felt like he was in college
*  for eight years. I think that was part of the problem with it, but I think people knew Shaq was
*  one, but Mourning was a great consolation prize. Hakim and MJ don't need to go over that. And then
*  Bird and Magic, which built over the course of the year. The difference was the Celtics already had
*  Bird because they had picked him the year before. Weird loophole. But that built, built, built in an
*  awesome way. This is different because Wemba Nyama is not going to be in college and neither is
*  Scoot. Scoot is going to be in the G League. Wemba Nyama is from France. And this kind of epitomizes
*  what the league is now, right? You have the modern day version of Bird and Magic from a draft battle.
*  Only one guy's in the G League and the other guy's playing abroad, overseas. So hopefully
*  neither of them will get hurt. But I do think this has a chance to be the best one, two punch in the
*  draft since Bird and Magic. Like if we're really going to go through. Shaq and Mourning was really
*  good too. Hakim and MJ, they weren't one too. MJ should have gone second. But this is going to be
*  something. We're going to be talking about this a lot. We're going to be talking about weird feeds,
*  watching this dude on his French team, seeing if he can develop some sort of jump hook, sky hook
*  thing over the, over the course of the year. I think Scoot is going to make the G League
*  a different kind of property this year. If he's that exciting, what we saw Tuesday night, if he's
*  just doing that on TV, this would be the first guy that G League's had that people are going to
*  actually be excited to watch. And then mention the tanking, but the tanking will get to the point
*  that by February we're going to have to start talking about how do we change the rules? What
*  do we do? What have we created? I don't care about any of this right now. All I know is the league is
*  as deep and as great as it's ever been. And we're adding these two guys at the very least that have
*  a chance to be first team all NBA guys for multiple years. And then in Wemba Yama's case,
*  really has a chance to be one of the great centers of all time. This could be in the
*  Wilt Kareem category of players. And it's not hyperbole. I guess his nickname is going to be
*  the alien, maybe UFO. I don't know. We'll figure it out, but something happened this week. I wish
*  I had gone. It was a really special to watch and I'm pumped and a lot of everyone who loves
*  basketball is so there you go.
