# Cavs Fire J.B. Bickerstaff. Does the NBA Have a Great Coaching Shortage? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbjDrKU8-Hk)
*  Cleveland fire JB Bickerstaff. So we're up to four coaches who were job preservation fired by the GM
*  Who was like hey don't look this way
*  Kobe Altman about to be five probably right who's the well I guess technically because if Monty Williams gets fired
*  by the new layered in
*  Trajan Langdon got hired to be the president of the Pistons. Oh, yeah, and they might fire
*  Yeah, Jalen you stabbed that joke when we all work together about the keep getting them checks, right?
*  Monty would be the all-timer right just completely fucks up the Pistons for a year gets 80 billion dollars. It's like a sunk cost
*  That listen
*  The GM is with the owners. I make this point
*  I'm gonna make it again the GM's with the owners and the people that run the team way more than the coaches are and
*  When things go wrong and the owners like hey, what the fuck we traded five first-rounders for Donovan Mitchell and marketing who made an all-star team
*  Where aren't we better the easiest thing to do is like, I don't know man this coach
*  What what is he doing and you're just buck passing buck passing buck passing?
*  the bottom line is maybe Cleveland should be cleaning house period and
*  You know, I just can't clean out the part of the house. That's probably the most detrimental which is Gilbert
*  you know and Gilbert's probably
*  like reading Ishby headlines and be like I'll get I can fire a guy like
*  Well, there was stuff today about how Mitchell
*  It's like leaning toward maybe signing the extension
*  So this might be the Ryan Rossellote area besides the extension that's for a trade a year from now
*  But we already know from all the reporting that Garland his representation
*  Same as CR. He's represented by clutch
*  that they might push for a Garland trade and
*  It does feel like Cleveland's gonna be the big pivot team for some trades this year
*  they might have a
*  Jared Allen trade and a Darius Garland trade in the next like five weeks and
*  I don't know what those guys would fetch but it's not gonna be an incident fit amount if your team might disperse and
*  Garland's on the table. I'm I'm like fucking let's go. Let's let's start
*  Trading I did Rob. Am I right? Like that's isn't Garland the ideal one, but Yamagai
*  I love that fit for Darius Garland sick. It's so good. It would be such a great pairing
*  And that's honestly what's so weird
*  I'll say unusual about the JB picker staff firing not that coaches don't get fired in this situation
*  But usually they get canned because you don't want to change the roster or you can't change the roster that your hands are kind of
*  Tied behind your back as far as what you could do with trades or free agency
*  The Cavs feel very much like a team like you're saying that is poised to make
*  significant deals to change the entire shape of their roster and yet
*  I guess they just want someone completely different to kind of envision how to use all those parts
*  But that's not usually what we see out there
*  Well Chris we knew we had a feeling when the Cavs got eliminated and eight minutes later
*  There was a fifty five hundred word story in the athletic
*  Yeah, but about all the terrible things in the JB becker staff area. So I can't say I was shocked
*  the weird thing is that the
*  coaching carousel and the coaching talent pool seems to be I
*  Wouldn't say it an all-time low because like I think there's some good coaches available
*  But I you wouldn't be like hey fire our guy for this dude, right?
*  Oh, right, like it's not like I mean honestly like it wouldn't be surprising
*  I guess if Vogel gets one of these jobs or something like that because of like his past success with the Pacers and the magic
*  But yeah and also winning a title, but I think maybe Vogel is better suited to coaching
*  you know like a kind of like
*  Mid table team like that then he is like maybe going back again again with another star-laden team
*  I feel like I have 25 of these guys are right around each other, right? Yeah, but like I I
*  This just doesn't seem like a draft class of coaches that you'd be like, hey, I'll go on the hook for several million
*  I mean Tom Gores if he fires Monty, he's Monty Williams. He's gonna owe him 60 million dollars
*  Like that's a crazy build a foot for who like who are you bringing in?
*  That you think is gonna
*  Revolutionize your culture that like in a way that Monty Williams couldn't I get it
*  I get that it seemed crazy and he wasn't playing Jade and Ivy and stuff like that like that
*  There was there were problems, but it that's a steep bill to pay
*  Well, there's no proven coaches in the market right the proven guys are James Borrego and Kenny Atkinson
*  like perfectly decent NBA head coaches with mixed records and
*  If you're not batting for them, then you're getting you know, the lead assistant off somebody's bench
*  Then you're going for Sam Cassell and yeah
*  Those are those are not the kinds of names that you envision as revolutionizing your franchise
*  Even though they're perfectly good coaches
*  But I mean I money is money and there's only 30 of those jobs or whatever
*  So I understand why people do it but like if I was Mike Enoria would be like
*  So I can be like the lead assistant of Minnesota. Yeah, or I can get fired in 18 months in Detroit
*  I'll stay in Minnesota. You know what? I really miss the big inefficiency right now with all this is
*  You know in the 80s and 90s teams would splurge on college coaches and they'd be like we've hired Lon Krueger
*  You missed this?
*  We've given Lon Krueger her 12 million dollars you miss Rick
*  No, but I missed these college coaches coming in and just being terrible was always really fun
*  It's like here comes PJ Carlisle. Oh my god is being strangled by one of his own players
*  It would be fun if Andy Enfield was just hired as like by an NBA team
*  Why not? Yeah, we had Calipari we had Patino. We you know, there was
*  Now now it's like it's just ring around the rosy with these NBA assistants
*  So like the Lakers let's say JJ is not the guy even though we all know the hiring JJ
*  They go from Vogel to Darvin Ham and then James Borrego
*  Like is there so they're gonna be still paying Vogel and still paying
*  Darvin Ham. Yes, but then also getting Borrego
*  Who's kind of in the same level as those other guys like I did they figure out that Tai Lu extension the Clippers?
*  Yeah, we got to bring him back. He lost in round one and six games. Got it. I gotta bring that guy back
*  NBA players are like this dude is a genius. So like I mean like he's a genius
*  He's never made the finals with the Clippers. Well, he's not an orc
*  Well, he's not an orthopedic surgeon like he can't keep that team healthy like he can only just I don't know
*  He wasn't knocking my socks off in that map serious. I wasn't like whoa Tai Lu
*  No, but is it more about the moves he's making? Oh
*  Is it more important as a coach to be a genius or for your players to think you're a genius?
*  Yeah, I think it was players think he's a genius cuz they kind of rolled over in the last two Cooper games
*  I don't really put that at Tai Lu's feet personally, but I can I my bigger point is there's probably like four coaches
*  That matter and I think everybody else like Bogle won a title four years ago. He said two jobs since
*  You know, it's just
*  Like I think Carlisle is a good coach, but Carlisle was also awful in Dallas for you know years and years
*  We're like, what are they gonna fire this guy?
*  Crazy. Yeah. Yeah, and it seemed like you wore out as welcome
*  How many Rob how many like really good coaches are there is it less than six?
*  I would say less than six that are significantly moving the needle for you and honestly at the bottom end
*  There's probably only two or three in the league at a given time that are actually that bad and most fan bases are just so
*  Dialed in on exactly what their coach is doing wrong or not doing that
*  It gets a little stretched out of proportion, but I don't know
*  I don't see a lot of needle movers out there. Even if your coach is a great at challenges
*  I mean congrats. That's like a couple possessions to swing a game. It's not an insignificant thing
*  But it's not it's not really changing who you are as a team
*  Those good, but I mean those guys are well expo as clearly in that group
*  Who else do we feel super confident is a dramatic like a transformational coach?
*  I mean you is it Finch or is it Anthony Edwards? Why why is Minnesota where they are?
*  I mean, they definitely has that demeanor that I think the team takes on there's a columnist to him
*  Right. I think kids done a really good job the last couple rounds and I was never a huge fan
*  Like like at previous stops, right? Right and even like this year
*  He was getting killed if you if you talk to any Mavericks fan in like February they were flipping out about him
*  But you know, it's a relationships business and the fact that he has Kyrie
*  This version of Kyrie he gets some credit for that, right?
*  You can say Kyrie got older and Kyrie's mature and Kyrie's in the right situation
*  GM for Dallas apparently like new PJ Washington for a really long time
*  And was like I know that this kid has like another gear and he's just been in a bad team in a bad situation
*  Yeah, I would love I would I think we're honestly at the point now where I would almost
*  Welcome in an era of coach trades
*  Because there's a bunch of guys who I think are good coaches or interesting coaches who are coaching the wrong team and
*  Who comes to mind for you?
*  Well, I would love to see popovich coaching like a team of guys who are like Olympic level basketball players just to see is
*  He lost his fastball or is he just like wasting the last few years of his career
*  Coaching guys who are like, you know, obviously Wembe but not great players, right or at least not yet
*  Well, I believe he did give up the chance to literally coach a team of Olympic level basketball players this summer, right?
*  Didn't he give up that spot to curve to coach team USA? Yeah, but I would like to like I
*  Don't think they wanted him in France. There's just too much wine. I don't know if they trusted him
*  He's gonna go I would like to see what would happen if popovich coach the Lakers
*  I know that that would be like Darth Vader coaching, you know, like for the for the
*  force or whatever but like I
*  Just I just would like to see what would like what would he do with LeBron and ad, you know
*  And then the same thing goes for like Quinn Snyder. I think his talents are kind of wasted in Atlanta
*  I think it would be cool to see him like coaching a different team
*  Yeah, like tips did a good job in New York
*  But at the same time the entire team got injured by the end of it as we were all joking about man
*  That's a lot of minutes on these guys and then now some of it is like Brunson breaks his hand like that's a fluke
*  But right, yeah, you know, I'll be playing 41 minutes a game and then getting hurt. I think was pretty easy to predict
*  He's not Cal Ripken
*  You
