# Are the Magic Ready to Make a Leap in the Southeast Division? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [October 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MaM2ZFn8PU)
*  Southeast Miami has the highest over under 44 and a half.
*  They were 44 and 38 last year.
*  I gotta say, this is an inexplicable over under to me.
*  And I think there's a lot of disrespect to a Miami team that I know I'm Dr.
*  Loomis in the Halloween franchise, just warning people about Michael Myers every year.
*  But man, this team, so they lose Struz and Vincent and they don't get Dame.
*  And the natural instinct is to go, write them off.
*  They're done. Well, they're fucked.
*  I think they're fine.
*  And I think I think Hero, I love every single quote I've read from him from the past two months.
*  He's fucking pissed that he was in trade rumors all summer.
*  I think he is the number one chip on the shoulder guy in the league right now for maybe not the talent of some of these other dudes.
*  But I think this is I think he's approaching this like I want to show everybody night after night that I can't believe Portland was like, nah, that's not enough.
*  Larry's in a contract here.
*  Jimmy Butler is in his, you know, his birthday at his mid thirties.
*  And, you know, I think he likes.
*  Consider himself now as one of the best guys in the league, which he should.
*  But Hawkeyes coming in.
*  Duncan Robinson, who they're able to resuscitate people like Jovich.
*  I think we're still Alex Jovich.
*  They still have banned.
*  They still have Jimmy.
*  They got Caleb Martin with some real sea legs under him now.
*  I think this team's going to be pretty good.
*  I think to me, this is like a mid to high forties for me.
*  And I didn't even really blink.
*  Would you have house?
*  Well, the the wind totals forty four and a half and they won forty four last season.
*  But their expected wins based on point differential was was they had a negative point differential because they won all those games in the clutch.
*  So the you know, but that's part of what makes them the heat is they're smarter than everybody else.
*  They have a defense every year.
*  That's why they have a top 10 defense.
*  They have the best coach in the league.
*  I'm not so sure that a motivated hero is what this team wants or needs.
*  I'm talking regular season only.
*  I understand.
*  I'm just trying to win regular.
*  It's just hard for hero like to go.
*  I can't believe all the disrespect.
*  It's like they made that run without you.
*  It is a gap.
*  It's still I'm just like who who says no hero for Harden.
*  I would do it if I were Philly.
*  I mean, but again, who are you asking here?
*  To me, I'm trying to get if I if if I'm trying to get hard in the Miami, that's Lowry for Harden and I'll throw in something else.
*  Good luck.
*  Now, but I'm not wearing Robinson.
*  I'm just not giving up here for one year.
*  Here's what sucks.
*  Here's what sucks for Miami is they spend all summer thinking this was going to happen.
*  But although I don't think it to the level of like clearly when the July conversation happens, a summer league where they're not even close and you know, on the initial conversation.
*  By the way, it was late June.
*  It wasn't even July where they think Dame is headed their way.
*  Probably starting around the draft.
*  Yeah.
*  But then June 28th.
*  But there's like a couple different times in the timeline there where then they're like they met in Vegas and then it was like, wait, you're asking for BAM again?
*  Because I always felt like, hey, don't there was a bunch of Miami stuff after the fact of like, oh, well, they weren't serious.
*  They were asking for BAM.
*  Like, have you ever heard about a Darrell Morey trade rumor request?
*  Like a lot of these guys, this is how they operate.
*  They start there.
*  Now, if Portland had its own motivation and not want to do it, you know, we've already been over this a million times.
*  But the back court situation for them, look, it's an over for me.
*  They mailed it in last year and got to 44 wins.
*  OK, so that's the number and it's the division.
*  And so you're like, look, Butler is older.
*  I think Lowry's kind of close to toast.
*  I mean, he had a couple of nice playoff moments.
*  But I mean, what are you really penciling in there?
*  Because they did all this waiting.
*  And, you know, again, I don't know what point they realized they were probably out of it.
*  They missed out on other options.
*  And then, you know, Struce is gone.
*  Vincent is gone.
*  They can replace Struce with Robinson.
*  Struce is nice for him.
*  I know he was.
*  But I mean, there's a reason Struce is.
*  Sure.
*  But there's a reason why Struce is playing over him because Duncan felt like somebody that could be targeted despite when he does have it going offensively.
*  Like he had some really nice possessions for him last year.
*  So look, it's an over for me, but I'm not going to beat myself over the head saying I have to put them as a tier one East team with the other teams up there.
*  I love the chip on the shoulder, not just with Hero, but with this whole team where it was like they didn't get damn thrown in the fucking dumpster.
*  And I think they thrive on that and they care about it.
*  And I'm just not writing them off.
*  I'm not.
*  The single biggest factor for me is Bolstra.
*  Yeah.
*  We just took a two month tour with that dude.
*  We just watched them do it to us right in our face for two months.
*  So yeah.
*  Would you?
*  All right.
*  So say they had gotten Dame.
*  That means Milwaukee is the same.
*  It means Boston is the same.
*  Who would you pick to win the East?
*  What do they get?
*  So if it's Lowry and Picks and they turn that into Dame?
*  No, Hero.
*  Hero.
*  I'm sorry.
*  Hero and Picks.
*  Yeah.
*  They do the deal that everybody in Miami does.
*  The problem is the deal wasn't perfect because they still needed to match the Dame number.
*  And the part everybody forgets of Portland when they talk about what they got back, they
*  wanted to get rid of Nurkic.
*  That was part of it.
*  So his Dame plus Nurkic was like 68 million.
*  Well, it also made zero sense for Sharp, Simon and Scoot to be closing a game with Hero.
*  Right.
*  But I'm just saying in a vacuum, like Miami would have had to take Nurkic back in the
*  trade with Dame.
*  All right.
*  Which means they would have to do Hero and Lowry and Jovovich and all their pairs.
*  Which they could have figured out a way to do.
*  But I'm just saying like if Miami has Dame and whatever pieces around it.
*  I probably would have.
*  I probably would have.
*  Still pick Milwaukee or Boston?
*  Yeah.
*  Me too.
*  Yeah.
*  Because I think the stuff they would have had to give up, I'm not positive that would
*  have cemented it.
*  But who knows?
*  We'll still hear from Miami this year because they still have their picks.
*  They have that Lowry expiring, which they can get a whole bunch of things back.
*  I think this is a possible hardened team.
*  We'll see how it goes.
*  Also, I'm not ruling out Donovan Mitchell for this team.
*  Interesting.
*  I'm just not.
*  I would add to that.
*  Like once they had missed out on Dame and then it was like this list of all these players
*  Riley couldn't get, I felt like that was getting a little unfair.
*  It's like, well, because...
*  Riley got LeBron and Wade in the same summer.
*  Riley pulled off Jimmy Butler and I'm still trying to figure out how he got Jimmy Butler
*  for Josh Richardson and Hassan Whiteside and a couple picks.
*  Like how the fuck did that even happen?
*  Mitchell for a hero and a bunch of picks.
*  If the Mitchell thing goes sideways, I still feel like it's sitting there.
*  The Atlanta Hawks.
*  41 and a half.
*  Plus 220 for the division.
*  49 to 1 to be the one seed.
*  That seems tough.
*  Minus 200 for the playoffs.
*  They were 41 and 41 last year and Vegas is saying, we're only going to spot them a half game.
*  House, what are your thoughts?
*  This is one of my favorite overs of the entire upcoming season.
*  And all of it is because of the respect that I have for Quinn Snyder.
*  We had a conversation earlier today.
*  Why do we think that Quinn Snyder chose this situation rather than waiting and seeing what other kind of opportunities came up?
*  Her wife loved Atlanta.
*  It's literally the answer, right?
*  That's the answer.
*  It makes more sense than the other answers that would be basketball related.
*  Happy wife, happy life.
*  It's like when Kyle opens a bar in Poughkeepsie.
*  Same thing.
*  She loved it there.
*  Kyle, if you do that, I'm honestly going to kill you.
*  Anyway, House.
*  The great thing about bar ownership is that when you can finally afford one, you're like, I shouldn't do this.
*  Wait, how late are these nights?
*  You've learned.
*  It's a bad investment.
*  Z tapes are even light the last couple of Sundays.
*  Speaking of bad investment, do we believe that Quinn Snyder can make Murray and Trey Young work?
*  So you haven't committed to an over and under yet.
*  It's one of my favorite overs on the entire board.
*  And I love the idea of them potentially at those odds winning the division because something could go south with that Miami situation.
*  And Atlanta is well poised to fill in there.
*  Getting rid of John Collins was addition by subtraction.
*  Yeah, they had too many guys and they had to fix the minutes.
*  What do you have, Rossello?
*  I like the over here and I feel good about it.
*  I think they were kind of a mess again last year.
*  Look, I've covered all my hawks thoughts, but I think they should be good enough to get 42 wins in this conference.
*  So that's kind of what it comes down to.
*  I mean, hell, the playoffs seem to be different because Trey will have these moments where he's still going to scare you a little bit.
*  Now, I think we've learned that, whether it was the Boston series last year or New York.
*  But there's some weird numbers you go through it like Trey and Murray on the floor together is like only a positive like one point six points better than the opposition pro 100.
*  You're like, hey, that's supposed to be a bigger number with those two guys.
*  And then the way they would try to split them up, like I kept watching all the different stuff.
*  All I think is like, you know, Hunter's going to be a little bit better, maybe a little bit more Jane Lynn Johnson, maybe a little more Sadik Bay, maybe not having Collins sit in the corner and miss shots.
*  Like that ended up being a salary dump, man, after all the years of what they could possibly get for him.
*  Legitimate salary dump.
*  I think Quinn and the talent level, because I have like the talent on the team, that should be 42 wins for the Atlanta Hawks.
*  So I think this is my single favorite over of all 30.
*  I've wagered on it.
*  I like them for the division and plus 220.
*  I think they're going to be a top four seed.
*  And I just really like the spot for them because I think the regular season.
*  Boston, Milwaukee, Miami or Boston, Milwaukee, Philly.
*  I think Boston, Boston, Milwaukee, Cleveland, Cleveland, Atlanta for.
*  Wow.
*  So we'll have Atlanta over the Knicks, Miami and Philly.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, it makes sense on your over unders.
*  Like I think I can think about, I think they're this year's Sacramento, where I just think they're going to be a really good regular season team.
*  The Quinn Steiner thing, even in the Boston series, you could feel it because Boston fucking killed them in the first two games.
*  Those last three games were good games and they tested Boston and they exposed some things that I think, you know, came back to haunt the Celtics in the next couple of rounds.
*  But getting rid of Collins, who I like, was important because they had too many guys and nobody was happy.
*  The Capella Kang Wu combo.
*  That's a real fucking center combo.
*  Those guys play together.
*  They're like 22 and 19 a game like they, you know, they have.
*  I think they overwhelm Miami in that playing game.
*  Hunter will see.
*  Maybe it's AJ Griffin in that wing spot.
*  Maybe AJ Griffin's even a better bet.
*  I still like the Bogdanovich as the third guard with these guys.
*  And from Trey, this is like a.
*  You know, he takes a lot of shit.
*  I could see him having a huge year and I think this could be a hard team to play.
*  We already know he can put up massive stats, but it's going to have to feel like.
*  But can you not go over?
*  I think the most they've ever won was 43.
*  They had that run in the playoffs.
*  I like this team and the Quinn Steiner thing is the number one reason for me because I just don't think they had good coaching.
*  I don't think Lloyd Pierce was a good coach.
*  I don't think Nate McMillan was a good coach.
*  I think Nate McMillan was better than Lloyd Pierce.
*  He was terrible.
*  But for the most part, this team just always looked like a mess to me.
*  Maybe, but I also know this team loved going to the media telling everybody it was the coach's fault too.
*  That's true.
*  So from a Trey standpoint.
*  I this feels like a fork in the road for him in a lot of ways this season.
*  I know he's young.
*  I know he's got years ahead of him, but.
*  You get to the point where you start developing bad habits as a player, and if you're just a good stats mediocre team guy, you kind of just end up that way.
*  You know, he's been in the league since 2018.
*  So what are you?
*  Can you make other guys better?
*  Is it just everything has to be built around you?
*  How do you measure success?
*  I just think this team's going to rise to the occasion.
*  I like their rebounding.
*  I like Bay on this team too.
*  So you think he he figures out how to be the guy where it's not just the numbers where it's like everybody's.
*  Yeah, like pick your spots and that's where like somebody like Quinn Snyder I think could really help him.
*  Right.
*  The quiet times it's not great for us if you take 31 shots right.
*  I know you had 40 tonight, but you know this and this and this didn't happen.
*  Maybe the you know, Patty Mills doing some veteran stewardship.
*  I'll tell you another thing for the chalkboard for the whiteboard for Atlanta.
*  I wanted my big Fando boost this year, which I've won the last two years.
*  I wanted it to be Celtics 50 plus wins, Lakers 45 plus wins and Atlanta 40 plus wins.
*  And it's like the way it gets boosted would be around plus 250 when we end up doing it.
*  And they asked if I could replace Atlanta with OKC because they said Atlanta was not a popular team with the betting public.
*  Put that on your whiteboard Atlanta.
*  Well, they're like put OKC in there.
*  OKC is a little more lovable.
*  People don't want to bet on Atlanta.
*  That was an actual, actual gambling take from Fando.
*  Well, it's their book.
*  So it's their number.
*  So you can't blame them.
*  They just said Atlanta.
*  People are like, eh, you know, tiny juice on the over minus 112 on the over.
*  All right, we're all going over in Atlanta.
*  That's definitely be a lot for me.
*  Well, now it gets interesting.
*  Well, we have three teams left.
*  You know what?
*  Actually, let's do Charlotte first.
*  And then we'll finish with Orlando.
*  I thought you said it gets interesting.
*  Well, that's right.
*  But I'm going to get Charlotte out of the way.
*  Charlotte's over under is 31 and a half.
*  No, Kai Jones.
*  So Kai Jones is gone.
*  Gone.
*  And the over under did not move.
*  Has anyone ever requested a trade and then been cut?
*  About 30 for 30 about the Kai Jones book night draft.
*  The 11th and 19th picks just own to.
*  I like book night.
*  I knew Kai Jones.
*  It was limited.
*  But like his journey over the last couple of months was fascinating.
*  Leave it at that.
*  The number didn't move.
*  I predict his social media presence to maybe be even a little more extensive than it's been.
*  So starting five of this team looks fine.
*  LaMelo, Roger, Brandon Miller, PJ Washington and Williams.
*  It's like, all right, that's solid on paper.
*  The bench, it falls off a quiff.
*  Hayward's probably their best bench guy.
*  This was a violent under for me.
*  And then it's been a sexy analytics team.
*  Pretty much everybody is saying over for this.
*  So the over 31 and a half.
*  I just don't personally see it.
*  What do you think, House?
*  I'm on the over.
*  And I think it's because last season I'm treating as a as an aberration.
*  They're 27 and 55 and the Mellow missed at least half the season.
*  I think that they're the team, you know, a couple of years ago that that what did they win?
*  Forty three wins in 2021, 22 and then 38 wins.
*  Yeah, I forgot to mention the bridge is coming back.
*  So you could say for the five starters from the 43 win team from two years ago are back.
*  But the conference was also worse two years ago.
*  Right. Because when you go right, Lamelo played 36.
*  Hayward played 50.
*  Although what do you really pencil that?
*  Pencil the 50 in every year.
*  Right. That's true.
*  Bridges plays zero.
*  You're like, wait.
*  But if you go back to two years ago and then won 43, I thought that was one of the most impressive seasons anyone had in the league.
*  Yeah, you were saying that at the time.
*  You were like, this team is the all time overachieve this.
*  Unbelievable.
*  They're in all these games in the fourth quarter.
*  That's why I just thought it was like, of course, Jordan would be like, oh, Borrego, we got to move on.
*  Do you realize what this guy has helped you do?
*  And, you know, Lamelo playing 70 games means what?
*  I mean, he has been statistically better than I thought he'd be.
*  He's more fun.
*  He's he's in a weird lane where he's like a rock star of a player because of the way he plays and the personality and the social media and everything.
*  But you know, the ball is a problem.
*  Hashtag problem.
*  But clearly, like there needs to be something else to his game to round out, like, wins or losses here.
*  And he's he's kind of avoided all this stuff like he's gotten all the good parts.
*  Yeah, but I think a lot of appalling playmaking right at the end of games.
*  I don't know.
*  Like, I imagine him being around for the full season.
*  It's weird because for me, the first time I was like, oh, my God, it's a 30.
*  And then I started digging into it a little bit more.
*  I was like, am I actually going to say over for the Hornets?
*  And I'm not the miles bridges piece to where he's going to be playing again and it's going to every he's going to go in every city and there's going to be a big story in the newspaper and it's going to be a sports radio thing.
*  And I know players that can go either way with how it affects people.
*  I think so that's 50 50 to me because I don't like him.
*  I don't think anybody gives a shit about the Charlotte Hornets.
*  Well, that might be true.
*  They're not coming to town.
*  And there's a story about this guy.
*  He hasn't played in two years and he's going to be one of the most villainized guys in the league and how that affects him.
*  I guess we'll see.
*  Just talk about it from gambling purposes.
*  I understand.
*  I bet it hard when it was at 30 and a half.
*  It's at the book right now at 31 and a half.
*  It's still an over for me.
*  I think they have seven.
*  I would have talked to you about this.
*  No, no, no.
*  I think they have seven guys that can play and 30 is such a low bar.
*  For them to hit this, Brandon Miller has got to be good immediately.
*  So, Rossello, I defer to you.
*  Well, because I think that's the way they like.
*  Yeah, right.
*  That's exactly that.
*  He's like legit good, like even like a little better than Keegan Murray last year in the Kings.
*  And I think he's going to be really good.
*  Well, so maybe they hit it.
*  But by the way, Bridges played in 21, 22.
*  He played 80 games and he was awesome.
*  He was 20 points a game.
*  Yeah, 27 and four.
*  The season he missed was last season.
*  He didn't miss two seasons.
*  Yeah, he's been 35 percent from he's going to be making 40 million dollars a year.
*  All right.
*  So you guys are going over.
*  I think I just switched it to over.
*  I'm definitely.
*  I just did it.
*  I'm going under.
*  I just can't live with myself otherwise.
*  All right.
*  Now it gets fun.
*  The Orlando Magic.
*  Steve Cerruti in the house for this.
*  He flew cross country just so we can talk to him about the Orlando Magic over under of 37 and a half.
*  That's not the only reason he flew across country.
*  We also wanted to see him.
*  I want to feed him.
*  Plus 900 for the division.
*  Just mentioning that plus 172 for the playoffs last year, they're 34 and 48 and house.
*  It's only four more wins and they hit the over.
*  What do you got?
*  I'm not just saying this because Rudy's sitting here.
*  I like the over.
*  OK, I like this team.
*  This is also one of these ones where their best player just was on a massive stage.
*  Both of them.
*  You know, two best players.
*  Sure, sure.
*  Yeah.
*  One's better than the other, though.
*  France.
*  France is better.
*  Yeah, France is better.
*  There's no argument, right?
*  Right now.
*  But I think there's an I think Palo is going to be awesome.
*  He's going to be awesome.
*  France is better right now.
*  Palo is 20 years old.
*  Yeah, that's part of the thesis for why there's a leap still for Palo.
*  And he got that time.
*  He was on that stage.
*  Well, we found out in the World Championships that him as a five is the destiny of Palo,
*  but that's probably two, three years away with the muscle and stuff.
*  Rossella, what do you got for this 37 and a half?
*  Because they're still so young, I was like, wait, I'm not going to be able to do this.
*  I'm going to be able to do this.
*  I'm going to be able to do this.
*  I'm going to be able to do this.
*  I'm going to be able to do this.
*  I'm going to be able to do this.
*  I'm going to be able to do this.
*  And they're still so young.
*  I was like, wait, I don't can you get 38, 39 wins out of this team?
*  But you know what?
*  I started thinking about it.
*  If I'm that high on Palo, the second year guys that are special, that's kind of when
*  it happens.
*  And they played so many teams so tough and they still didn't really know what the rotation
*  is.
*  And I think they may just collectively be like, hey, we know we drafted a lot of you
*  guys.
*  And again, that's sort of the Anthony Black, Suggs, Cole Anthony, Markel Foltz, who's getting
*  the opportunity?
*  I don't like the Howard Pick at all, but.
*  Frans and Palo are that good.
*  They just are.
*  And so I was going to say I was going to say under, but I'm going over.
*  I was leaning toward under as I told Saruti before the podcast, but I have too many unders.
*  And 37 and a half.
*  I need one more over.
*  If they were 30 wins, I go, man, that's a pretty big leap.
*  Like think about all the times you're watching them late in the year.
*  We're like, they figured something out here.
*  You and I were talking during the year.
*  Like we were saying, like, man, if there's one team that's better than their record,
*  it's probably Orlando.
*  They were in.
*  They had big wins against good teams.
*  They lost some last second games.
*  It worries me with the guards because you have.
*  But they may just say, screw it and be like, we're done pretending that this is an equal
*  opportunity position thing.
*  This many years.
*  I think that would be smart.
*  Suggs, Anthony.
*  Anthony black and faults and faults is in a contract here.
*  And I actually like, I saw from faults last year.
*  I think faults.
*  So Rudy's the faults is good guy and he's been right about it for a long time.
*  And Jonathan Isaac potentially coming back.
*  I'm going to go over only because I think those two guys are going to play the for six
*  months and give a shit the whole time and be in games and have a couple of nice big
*  wins.
*  It just worries me.
*  It looks a little too obvious.
*  I think we won.
*  We picked the over last year, didn't we?
*  We did.
*  Yeah, we did.
*  I'm pretty sure we hit it.
*  We loved Orlando last year.
*  So this is a Palo Frans bet.
*  I also really like Frans for most improved because I think that could know insulting.
*  That is a sorority.
*  No, I'm remember SGA won that year when he jumped to like 27 points a game.
*  He was already good, but then he had that stat jump.
*  Right.
*  And could France have a stat jump like that?
*  I don't know.
*  You have to be the only guy and have the ball every time.
*  His most improved odds.
*  I think the only reason I liked it was because they were they were pretty high.
*  They were like Austin Reeves is better.
*  Yeah, he's 30 to one for most improved.
*  I could see it.
*  All right.
*  So Rudy, what do you got?
*  I mean, they started five and 20 last year.
*  That was mostly five and 20 and that was mostly because false was out.
*  And they're like, hey, Frans and Palo run the show and they weren't really ready to do it.
*  They finished 29 and 28.
*  I mean, that's that's on pace to be the sixth seed, the seventh seed.
*  And the conference is worse.
*  I think that middle area is a little bit because it's that middle area is dense.
*  There's a lot of teams that are kind of the same.
*  The Pacers are in there.
*  I mean, their their best case scenario is like maybe Brooklyn, Chicago, Toronto, two of those teams, maybe just drop off and they get into the play.
*  I mean, their number is higher than Toronto's number.
*  Yeah.
*  The issue is they still struggle to score and they still don't.
*  I mean, I've been saying this since 2010.
*  It feels like they just don't have enough shooting and they I don't maybe Jeff Howard solves that.
*  People didn't like that pick.
*  I don't know. I'll wait to see what it's like.
*  The number seems right.
*  Thirty seven and a half seems right around where they'd win.
*  But I mean, every playing team last year was had 40 wins.
*  So yeah, I think it's more likely they win 40 games and is they win like thirty three.
*  So I, you know, I'm biased, but I would I would lean over.
*  There's a piece of it where I just want to root for it because I know I'm going to love this team as a league pass team.
*  It'll be a top five for me and I don't want to be in the back of my head rooting for the under.
*  But I believe in the Franz Palo combo just being a bitch to play over the course of six months because we're going to have that that that turn midseason tournament in December.
*  And somebody weird is going to end up in there out of the eight.
*  And it's going to be a team like this that just has two young players.
*  And I think the cool thing, too, is those guys are willing teammates like they've already gotten past the stuff that maybe frustrates me with other young guys where the only way they think they can contribute is by shooting.
*  I don't.
*  I don't feel like I'm betraying Steve Kurt.
*  He he was so impressed by Palo and just thought the guy is going to be a beast.
*  And he probably said that publicly, but I think that whole coaching staff was like, Jesus, holy mackerel.
*  Like, what is this guy going to be?
*  They all they all think he's going to be a five.
*  I don't know how many years down the road it is.
*  But when you think like he's can't even legally drink yet, what's he going to look like down the road?
*  The the beating people off the dribble stuff last year from him was just breathtaking.
*  We talked about a lot.
*  There's going to be a physicality to him as he gets bigger as he puts on muscle.
*  And then the Franz piece, like I don't know how good that guy can be, but he would be on the short list of who can jump up and suddenly become an all star.
*  That stuff he was doing, I know, is the World Championships, but the stuff he was doing was like really high level.
*  Like they were running everything through him.
*  That's the poise point is the thing.
*  And then that's what you know, Saruti's observation about how that team was a winning, had a winning record for a sustained run.
*  That's because Franz Wagner has the poise.
*  They're going to rebound to the shooting is going to be the issue.
*  And, you know, to me, it's more likely somebody like Suggs is just all of a sudden better than he was last year.
*  Foltz in a contract here, whatever it is.
*  So we're all going over.
*  We're going over.
*  So you're like too afraid to go over.
*  What could go wrong?
*  I think the numbers really right.
*  OK.
*  Well, the numbers really right for our last team of the preview.
*  The Wizards of Washington.
*  Twenty three and a half last year, they're thirty five and forty seven.
*  They are thirteen to one to make the playoffs house.
*  Here's the starting five.
*  As far as I could tell, Tyus Jones, who's just on eBay right now, just like does anyone want to trade for a point guard?
*  He's been in some big games.
*  Jordan Poole, who Kevin Garnett unironically asked, could he be used like James Harden on Houston was an actual podcast moment.
*  Corey Kispert, who has some nice, nice shooting percentages.
*  Kyle Kuzma just got paid and Gafford.
*  This team is awful house.
*  Why do you think they can go over?
*  Because this team is not any worse than the team that the Washington franchise put on the floor last season.
*  Talent wise, this team, I would argue the thirty five win last year team that had poor Zingas scoring twenty three a game.
*  Well, and Beale Kuzma.
*  They had 40 games of Beale last season.
*  So part of House's premise is Poole can replace a lot of the Beale stats.
*  He can replace all of them.
*  He'll certainly replace the field goal attempts.
*  Kuzma was the guy who got the touches at the end of the game, not poor Zingas.
*  And it was proper.
*  Winning recipe there.
*  He's a lot more.
*  The problem, the reason that I love this is because twenty three and a half is so low.
*  Yeah.
*  So they have three guys that are professional guys that are auditioning for their next situation.
*  Tyus Jones, Jordan Poole, Kyle Kuzma.
*  They're not motivated.
*  They're not motivated to go stink, though.
*  They're like competent.
*  They're not incompetent.
*  And Dilan Wright is going to be a tremendous asset for somebody.
*  Look at that guy's advanced metrics for.
*  Kerala Babu always loved him.
*  He gets his hands on balls, you know, better than a Kardashian.
*  It's an amazing skill set.
*  He's tremendous at this.
*  Don't sleep on my guy, Kula Bali.
*  Kula Bali.
*  They actually, I think this new regime in Washington hit a draft pick.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  This dude is crazy long, has tremendous poise.
*  He played with Wemby all year last year.
*  He's not afraid of nothing.
*  People think he belongs in a professional basketball court.
*  There is some some quotes coming out about him from the players and coaches that are
*  like reminiscent of the baby rhino stuff with Jaylen Carter and the Eagles.
*  The team mates are like this guy, Jesus.
*  Holy mackerel.
*  They suck, dude.
*  I don't.
*  They do suck.
*  Don't misunderstand.
*  Twenty four wins is a W though.
*  Twenty four wins.
*  You're not getting a 20.
*  Here's the reason.
*  You won't get to 20 wins.
*  They will start tanking at the trade deadline when most of these guys are gone.
*  They're going to go like two for 28.
*  Fifty five games between the start of the season and the trade deadline.
*  So if they win 20, this is the first time I've ever been worried about you as a
*  Washington basketball fan.
*  If they go 20 and 30 through the first 50 games, why not?
*  Why can't they?
*  Because they're not good.
*  They don't have any.
*  There's not even like a possible all star in this team house.
*  Well, Jordan Poole begs to differ.
*  And he's going to show you.
*  Jordan Poole is going to show you that he's got.
*  He was just they were holding back.
*  Steve Kerr and Draymond were holding back in Golden State.
*  I actually think Jordan Poole now that Dinwiddie looks like he's not going to have the ball
*  enough, Jordan Poole is going to be our number one.
*  His teammates hate playing with him guy.
*  That's my prediction.
*  I like that I read an article on Hoops Hype that Danilo Gallinari said he couldn't wait
*  to play the Celtics.
*  Oh, revenge game with Gallo.
*  What are you mad about?
*  Yeah, they did tell him that he was staying.
*  How about Johnny Davis?
*  He didn't mention him.
*  He's an unmentionable.
*  How's you missed on like five straight first round picks until Kula Bali?
*  It's a whole new thing.
*  We don't even know that that's a hit yet.
*  But I'm just at least giving it a do not know.
*  Kispert.
*  I kind of like Kispert, but didn't they take him like ninth?
*  Took him too high.
*  Yeah, he could shoot though.
*  Rossello, is this 2024 Stealth Trade Machine team?
*  Feels like there's a lot of trade machine action with this team.
*  Yeah, but I don't know.
*  Like, what do I want?
*  I don't want Poole's contract.
*  And I don't know that I want Poole in a me against the world Tupac season.
*  You know, that's the other part.
*  And Kula Bali is going to do whatever he wants to do.
*  So based on watching him play, I like Gafford.
*  Kuzma has actually been pretty good for him.
*  You know, and he got paid and maybe there's something there.
*  But yeah, I think a lot of teams will call about Tyus Jones.
*  I think Poole's on the team the whole season just for the record.
*  I think with that contract, yes.
*  If he plays really well though and his shooting percentages are close to what...
*  Because he shoots.
*  Then keep him.
*  Right, we keep him.
*  And maybe he's either a cornerstone piece as you grow.
*  I hate to break it to you.
*  His contract will be cheaper.
*  You're keeping him either way.
*  No, his contract is going to look good in a year.
*  If he's a cornerstone, you're keeping him.
*  If he's not a cornerstone, you're not going to be able to trade him.
*  I think they are going to be able to trade him.
*  The three people in your life for the next few years are your wife, your son, and Jordan Poole.
*  That's how it's going to play out.
*  I'll invite him over.
*  He can have Chipotle.
*  We like Chipotle at the house household.
*  I just don't see it.
*  I'm going hard under.
*  You're locking it?
*  Possible lock.
*  Fine, go ahead.
*  I don't think I'd lock it.
*  I just think they get the pole position in the lottery with this team.
*  I don't see a worse team.
*  There's too many professional players.
*  They're over under.
*  You're comparing it to like Hinky Sixers experiments.
*  I think that's what's throwing you off here.
*  They're better than the Spurs.
*  They're going to be more competitive than Portland.
*  House, you're over under is four wins lower than every other team in the league.
*  I think that's a mispricing.
*  This is fascinating now.
*  We've got some serious Wizards takes.
*  You think it's realistic with the Wizards too.
*  I also think the other thing is that they...
*  Something's going on with House.
*  You're wrong.
*  There's nothing here that's core.
*  There's nothing here that's like, hey, even with Wemba Nyama, San Antonio, even last year when they were tanking, they were still running stuff offensively.
*  They were like doing things.
*  I think Detroit actually planned on being a lot better than they were last year, but then Cade goes down for the...
*  There's not one guy in this Wizards roster where I think they're going to be like, wow, we got to make sure we set the standard immediately, even though it's a really good front office.
*  Who's your coach has?
*  Until Junior.
*  Did you have to check?
*  No, I knew it was...
*  I wanted to make sure I didn't say Bickerstaff because we had a long run with Bickerstaff.
*  He's the other worst coach in the East.
*  West Until Junior is the worst coach in the East and then Bickerstaff is the second worst coach in the East.
*  All right.
*  I'm going to recap our over unders and then we're going to do locks.
*  Celtics, 54 and a half, we all went over.
*  Sixers, 47 and a half, all went under.
*  Knicks, 45 and a half, three overs.
*  Nets, 37 and a half, all under.
*  Toronto, 36 and a half.
*  I went over.
*  House went over.
*  Rosillo under.
*  Miami Heat.
*  I went over.
*  What did you do on that one?
*  I didn't write it down, Rosillo.
*  Over.
*  And you're over as well?
*  Yes.
*  Okay.
*  Three overs for the Heat.
*  Then the Atlanta Hawks.
*  We were kind of giddy about them.
*  Three overs.
*  Orlando Magic, 37 and a half, three overs, but I think probably because Cerruti was here.
*  There's an alternate universe where Cerruti's not here and maybe we're arguing more about the Magic.
*  I did change my mind on it.
*  That's fine.
*  Charlotte, 31 and a half.
*  Rosillo and House went over.
*  I went under.
*  I don't feel great about it.
*  I don't feel great about the over.
*  Yeah, I just wish they weren't in the league.
*  Washington, 23 and a half.
*  Lock.
*  Under for me and Rosillo, over for House.
*  So there you go.
*  All right.
*  It's time for the locks.
*  House, what do you have for locks out of the 30 teams?
*  How many are we doing?
*  What's the right number?
*  You can do one, you can do three, you can do five.
*  I'm probably doing six.
*  You're doing six, my God.
*  Well, I did seven last year.
*  I think I went six and one.
*  I'm good at these.
*  My locks.
*  Best there ever is, man.
*  One of the best.
*  Atlanta, over, is a lock for me.
*  Is that a lock for you, Rosillo?
*  Not a lock.
*  Let's not lose our minds here.
*  Oh, well, it's a lock for me and it might be one of my favorites.
*  What else, House?
*  I can't do the Hornets, but I really want to do it.
*  But I'm not going to do it.
*  Just do it, you wuss.
*  I'm not going to do it.
*  Do it, you coward.
*  I love the Pacers.
*  The Pacers is a lock for me.
*  Okay.
*  They're a lock for me as well.
*  Add me to the list.
*  We love some Pacers basketball in this party.
*  All right, Tyrese.
*  That was my favorite one.
*  That's a good one.
*  It's too low.
*  It's too low.
*  We're all in agreement.
*  It's too low.
*  House?
*  Who else?
*  I am on the Sun's Under.
*  That's a lock for me.
*  Oh.
*  I'm not.
*  I mean, we did it last year.
*  Eddie, you know, makes fun of the podcast for it.
*  It's fine.
*  I'm going to do...
*  Man, I'm not going to do a lock.
*  I really like that under, though, for them.
*  I'm going to say a lock.
*  I'm going to say a block.
*  it's fine. I'm gonna do... I'm not gonna do a lock. I really like that under
*  though for them. Phoenix? Yeah. Yeah I think it's good. It's really good but I'm
*  not gonna lock it because I don't feel as strongly about as the other ones but
*  I really like that one. All right what else House? I'm only gonna do four.
*  It's the Clippers can forever fuck off lock of the year. The Clippers is a lock
*  under for me. Okay. Rossello? Denver over lock. Okay. 52 and a half. New Orleans
*  over lock. 44 and a half. Pacers over. Yep. And I'm just staying positive here. Miami
*  over. Okay. And then Dallas over. No net no unders. Dallas over? That's amazing.
*  This year... Positive guy. You're up to something. How many did you just do? You did five.
*  I want to add one more. Okay. Boston over. I do believe in Boston. I'm looking down
*  at my notes. I left it off. The Boston over. I love the Boston over. I'm just stupefied
*  by Dallas for you Rossello. So you're saying Kyrie's gonna have a normal
*  season? No. No. I've never guaranteed that. I just think that... It's just a blind
*  Luca bet. It would be a blind Luca kind of like everything they did around it
*  and he comes in more motivated than ever before after last season being that
*  disappointing. My locks are... Weird they have I think all overs. Lakers over.
*  47 and a half. Oklahoma City over. 44 and a half. I'm really jealous of House's
*  Phoenix under but I'm not gonna do it. I am gonna do under for Portland at 27 and
*  a half because I think that team is built to not be good this year. I have
*  the Atlanta over 41 and a half. I have the Miami chip on their shoulder over
*  44 and a half. Us against the world. Fuck you. 45 and 37 season. I also have the
*  Indiana over 38 and a half and I would have had the Philly but it dropped
*  enough that I don't feel like it's a lock because if NB just plays... They were
*  so good last year that there's a world where they figure their shit out. Maxi even
*  if Harden's going around. Yeah. That's a stay away to me. I really want to do Washington as an under
*  lock. Should we just do that as a fuck you to house? Yeah. Put me down. Go ahead. I'm down too.
*  I did not give my Washington pick as a lock. Alright me and Rassil are under 23 and a half
*  locks. Fine. The Wizards. Fine. Every W I'm sending you. I'm gonna create a Twitter
*  X handle for it.
