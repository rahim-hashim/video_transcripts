# Is OKC Ready to Win It All This Year? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo)
*  Let's do okay. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=0.0s)]
*  See why they won. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=0.84s)]
*  Did you feel like they went through playoff puberty in this game in some [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=2.08s)]
*  ways? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=4.84s)]
*  Cause they were tight in the first quarter, like legit. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=6.12s)]
*  I felt like there was two guys that showed up for their first quarter, SGA [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  and Caruso and everybody else. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=13.36s)]
*  The sphincters were like this. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=15.0s)]
*  I'm glad you said that because it's exactly what I saw and the Jalen Williams [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=17.56s)]
*  game six performance was so disappointing because then you're thinking, okay, what [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=22.88s)]
*  do I even know what to expect from this guy? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=27.8s)]
*  Somebody that was supposed to have his off playoff games. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=30.64s)]
*  Maybe we're a little unfair. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=34.44s)]
*  It's like, okay, you're a young guy. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=35.76s)]
*  You weren't great against Dallas. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=36.96s)]
*  You couldn't be counted on as that second scorer to SGA. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=38.2s)]
*  Like you need that second guy to create on the ball when everything's a mess. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=40.32s)]
*  And if you don't have it, you're so limited as a playoff team. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=45.64s)]
*  And I think there was something to be desired there based on, you can look at [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=49.0s)]
*  the final box scores of the Dallas series and be like, Oh, it wasn't all that bad. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=52.8s)]
*  It's just funny. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=55.56s)]
*  I think that stuff becomes the most misleading stuff. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=56.08s)]
*  Like there's some efficiency stuff that I'll look at with a player in a series [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=58.44s)]
*  and go, there's no way he was this. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  Like, this is a bad reflection. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=63.56s)]
*  These metrics are too rewarding to however he played because just in the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=65.44s)]
*  moment you needed more from him. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=69.16s)]
*  So he has that abominable game six at Denver. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=70.56s)]
*  And, you know, look, I think it's fair to say even for a guy like Jalen Williams, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=75.24s)]
*  like at Denver, you know, going up against the best player in the world, you get [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=80.75999999999999s)]
*  the Strother game out of nowhere. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=84.28s)]
*  I mean, he was wide open one because of Jokic and two, because it felt like OKC [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=85.88s)]
*  like, Hey, do you want to guard this guy? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=90.56s)]
*  I was like, no, we don't want to guard him at all. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=92.32s)]
*  So when the nuggets had four guys like that, that OKC was like, go ahead. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=94.92s)]
*  There was a couple of five man stretches that Adelman, like even he had to be [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=100.8s)]
*  looking at the score table going, I can't believe I have to do this right now. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=104.84s)]
*  But in that first quarter, I'm like, what's up with Hardenstein? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=107.96s)]
*  Like after he missed those two floaters in the baseline earlier in the series, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=111.0s)]
*  it's like, does he not want to shoot that anymore? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=114.36s)]
*  Jalen Williams getting a couple of open looks. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=116.04s)]
*  And there were so many open looks that were great looks in game six. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=117.76s)]
*  And it looked like he was going to be tight again. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=121.64s)]
*  And I'm thinking this can't possibly he's not going to be this bad. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=123.36s)]
*  Game six and game seven, is he? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=127.2s)]
*  I mean, he had a three. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=129.88s)]
*  Denver's playing so much zone. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=131.72s)]
*  They're collapsing the top for SGA. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=132.96s)]
*  So as she is getting cut off, it's kind of work. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=134.72s)]
*  And there's a kick out to the right side a little bit later in the game, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=137.64s)]
*  where Jalen Williams just turns it down. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=140.24s)]
*  And I'm thinking like, you don't even want to take like you. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=142.36s)]
*  I remember you have to take this shot. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=144.36s)]
*  But what I loved about game six is against that Denver zone. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  If you could find any way to collapse, there were all sorts of points [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  waiting for you on guys just cutting on the baseline and in the dunker spot. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=155.12s)]
*  You saw more of that with the check. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  They had one play worth check past a Caruso and he made a layup. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=161.52s)]
*  Caruso beat his man and Dort was coming from the other side. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=164.8s)]
*  Both baseline cutters are wide open. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  So, you know, there was a lot of stuff that I saw in six that I thought [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=170.36s)]
*  if they can just go, hey, when they zone us, because they're going to like crazy. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=174.08s)]
*  Well, Gordon hurt, you knew the zone was going to be bigger. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=178.8s)]
*  Right. Yeah. So, you know, there's a lot of stuff. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=182.44s)]
*  But the fact that Jalen Williams stepped up and played the way he did today. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=184.76s)]
*  And I think there was like one driver you could tell, OK, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=188.28s)]
*  he's now feeling it a little bit. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=190.76s)]
*  You could see his confidence was a completely different place. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=192.68s)]
*  Started to attack. He was 42, 41. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=195.4s)]
*  I'm not a live better and I'm also gambling is not legal in California, but. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=198.76s)]
*  It felt like the perfect live bed spot because Gordon had given them a lot [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=203.64s)]
*  in the first quarter. Brown had made some shots. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=207.36s)]
*  OK, see, missed everything from three. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=211.08s)]
*  I think they were like one for 10 at some point. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=212.72s)]
*  And you could just feel the game. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  You could feel it starting to shift potentially. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=217.72s)]
*  And then they hadn't taken any free throws when it was like, right. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=219.84s)]
*  And then Denver had like 10 free throws, something like that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=222.56s)]
*  But that Caruso Wallace combo, which I think is going to be a real problem [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=226.36s)]
*  for Minnesota to like, like even thinking not to jump ahead to the next series. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=230.36s)]
*  But you think like Connelly is like the one point guard. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  Then they'll bring Edward. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  Edwards will have the ball sometimes. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  Then it'll get weird with like Alexander Walker and D. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=240.44s)]
*  Fuenchenzo. And that's when these OKC guys feast like they're [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=242.88s)]
*  over the midcourt line and they just come in waves where it's like, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=247.24s)]
*  it's Caruso Wallace now dorts in to. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=250.92000000000002s)]
*  Oh, wait, here's Jalen Williams. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=252.96s)]
*  And they're just trying to make you uncomfortable over and over and over again. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=254.84s)]
*  I think it's going to be a problem for Minnesota, but it became a problem for [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=258.52s)]
*  Denver and it was one of the worst Russ. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=262.16s)]
*  It wasn't Russ. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=264.64s)]
*  Wasn't just bad. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=265.48s)]
*  He had like three or four passes where you're just going, what is that? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=267.2s)]
*  You just game seven. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=273.56s)]
*  How is that the pass you just threw? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=274.68s)]
*  Uh, and then Strother and Watson, you know, it was no surprise [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=276.4s)]
*  turned into pumpkins and Murray was. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=280.2s)]
*  Uh, not really playoff Jamal. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=282.88s)]
*  And then Porter was playing with one arm and Gordon was playing with one leg. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=284.76000000000005s)]
*  And then Caruso began the start of the game. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=287.76000000000005s)]
*  And I guess Caruso guarding Yokelach. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=290.6s)]
*  I feel like it's a slight hit for the Yokelach legacy that Caruso is able to do that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=293.68s)]
*  But to defend Yokelach, which I have to, cause I love Yokelach. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=299.08000000000004s)]
*  Um, I really did feel like they were getting away with a lot with how they [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=302.92s)]
*  were pounding him physically, which they should have because they were getting [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=306.56s)]
*  away with it all serious, but I'm not really sure what Denver is supposed to do. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=309.32000000000005s)]
*  When they're defending him like that. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=314.28s)]
*  I don't know what the move is. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=316.4s)]
*  Like if you're just, you're putting smaller guys, they're planning, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=317.71999999999997s)]
*  they're pushing, they're shoving. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=320.2s)]
*  If he's turning around and going into them, he's just going to knock them over. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=322.0s)]
*  It's an offensive foul, right? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=324.44s)]
*  He's not fast enough to go by him. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=326.08s)]
*  You don't have any spacing because nobody can shoot. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=328.24s)]
*  So I'm not sure they finally like moved them to the top of the key, like 25 [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=331.12s)]
*  feet back to give him, try to give him more space by that time it was too late. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=334.64s)]
*  Not really sure what the move is, but I wonder if OKC might've stumbled [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=338.28s)]
*  onto a strategy with him. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=341.28s)]
*  Now there's that many Caruso's in the league, but like, let's say it had been [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=343.04s)]
*  alternate universe, Celtics, Denver finals. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=346.8s)]
*  Could drew holiday have guarded him like that? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=349.96s)]
*  Like could other teams, do other teams have guys that could do that? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=351.92s)]
*  Or is Caruso just that special? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=355.76s)]
*  I don't know how it would look for seven games. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=358.96s)]
*  I guess for one game you could do it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  Caruso might end up shooting like 10% from three because he's so [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=363.88s)]
*  exhausted the entire time. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=367.12s)]
*  Look, Yokochi could have been better today. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=368.72s)]
*  Certainly he wasn't a great Yokochi. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=370.72s)]
*  No, some of the passing or it's just like throwing it back to him and he's [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=373.68s)]
*  turning the ball over because it's getting knocked out of his hands. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=379.48s)]
*  Like a couple were definitely on him. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=382.64000000000004s)]
*  He had the one late where he tried to go right at Caruso at the top and he just [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=384.76000000000005s)]
*  got stripped. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=387.52000000000004s)]
*  There's another one from Murray where he's throwing him a buddy pass and all [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=388.36s)]
*  Wallace has to do is just see it coming in. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=391.48s)]
*  So I think there was a bunch of different things, but I think overall, if [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=393.72s)]
*  you're looking at Yokochi just saying that he was the problem, I mean, the [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=397.68s)]
*  number of times that you're watching defenders, and I think over the course of [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=401.16s)]
*  the series, you get more and more comfortable with it being like, all [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=405.96000000000004s)]
*  right, well, Westbrook hits a couple of corner threes. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=408.64000000000004s)]
*  We're okay with it. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=411.20000000000005s)]
*  Like as long as we try to stay in front of Murray at the top and then collapse on [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=412.0s)]
*  Yokochi, because you could sit there and say, well, Caruso. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=415.64000000000004s)]
*  Game six, same thing. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=417.88000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, they just left. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=419.64000000000004s)]
*  I mean, there was at one point, I mean, the game was like basically over at this [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=421.16s)]
*  point, but I looked at it to see what Strother, Watson and Westbrook were, and [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=425.4s)]
*  they were one of four, oh, a six and two, a seven. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=428.91999999999996s)]
*  So if you're not getting anything out of any of those guys, then good luck. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=431.76s)]
*  And then I guess I got a porter too, like as you're expecting, like. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=435.52s)]
*  Best case scenario, like a 15 and seven something from him, but you weren't [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=440.71999999999997s)]
*  getting that. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=444.03999999999996s)]
*  Nothing, nothing. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=444.88s)]
*  And, you know, at least you have to defend him as if he's going to shoot, but [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=445.88s)]
*  like, it was just a bunch of bricks from him. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=449.4s)]
*  Um, you know, maybe you say, Hey, Yokochi needs to get deeper on the catch and [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=451.44s)]
*  then have crew, but then if you're doing that, there's just so much more traffic [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=454.8s)]
*  in there defensively that I think they want Yokochi to have more space to get [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=458.32s)]
*  it outside of the elbow, to be able to turn and shoot, to turn and drive. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=462.48s)]
*  Um, but also the further he goes away, now I don't have his rebounding and I [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=466.68s)]
*  got Gordon on one leg and that, okay. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=470.44s)]
*  So he started killing them on the boards too, which was another thing, but the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=472.32s)]
*  turnovers and they had, I think 23 turnovers halfway through the fourth [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=475.08000000000004s)]
*  quarter, which if you have over 20, just in a normal NBA game, that's a lot. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=479.0s)]
*  That's like, Whoa, didn't take care of the ball today. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=484.64s)]
*  They said the ball was. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=486.72s)]
*  Well, you're going to lose. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=488.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=490.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=490.68s)]
*  So you had, at halftime, they're up 14 because they have this [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=491.0s)]
*  crazy run in the last three minutes. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=494.48s)]
*  They're five for 20 from three and they're up 14 and they've eight steals. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=496.76s)]
*  And it's like, that's it. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=501.0s)]
*  There's no road back for Denver. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=501.88s)]
*  What you need like Christian Brown to have like 35 points. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=503.52s)]
*  So you need some complete, or you need Russ to flip it on. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=507.44s)]
*  And by the way, how mad do you think the Clippers were watching this [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=511.08s)]
*  series with Russ? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=513.88s)]
*  I think Russ was like minus 86 in the series games, five, game six, game seven. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=514.72s)]
*  He was like just universally atrocious. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=519.56s)]
*  And you think like he was one of the guys that swung that Quipper series. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=523.04s)]
*  And then turned into he's another one who turned into a pumpkin, but I [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=526.68s)]
*  saw, I, if I'm the Quippers, I'm still looking back at that round one being like, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=530.16s)]
*  how, how did we not get past this team? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=533.6s)]
*  Like how, what, what, what happened? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=536.88s)]
*  You know, but they, to Denver's credit, they were able to play 14 [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=540.48s)]
*  playoff games somehow just to get okay. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=543.48s)]
*  See the seven I thought was a remarkable. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=545.28s)]
*  Cause, uh, I don't know. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=548.16s)]
*  I just don't think that teams were close from a talent standpoint. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=550.48s)]
*  I don't know who can beat an entire team when every single defender is just like [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=554.28s)]
*  all they really care about is you and Murray's elimination game track record [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=560.44s)]
*  is terrific. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=564.44s)]
*  He's got two 40 point games. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=565.08s)]
*  He's got the 50 point game in there. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=566.4s)]
*  So you wondered, you know, you're going to get another Murray moment out of this. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=568.36s)]
*  The fact that he played as well as he did with the illness in game six. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=571.5200000000001s)]
*  Um, but, you know, just over the course of a series when you're going, okay, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=574.48s)]
*  when you'll catch does this, you know, and now it's like three, four, five, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=578.72s)]
*  you know, in this case, seven games in a row. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=582.2s)]
*  It's like, when he does this, when he catches here, we're doing this. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=583.84s)]
*  And then everybody's just in tune. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=586.08s)]
*  And when you wait around on, okay. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=587.76s)]
*  See, and everybody starts flying around and the help is so good and they're so [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=589.32s)]
*  smart and all this stuff starts happening. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=593.36s)]
*  Uh, I'm with you. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=596.12s)]
*  I can't believe that Denver played 14 playoff games. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=596.96s)]
*  I think that's well said. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=599.36s)]
*  Um, the other thing with the hook Casey is they have different looks, like [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=600.64s)]
*  almost like a football team where they can be like, oh, we're just going [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=604.1999999999999s)]
*  to rush you conventionally up. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=608.3199999999999s)]
*  Now we're bringing in six defensive backs. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=609.52s)]
*  Oh, now we're blitzing from this side and you just kind of never know what to expect. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=611.28s)]
*  So I'm sure mentally just trying for yoga and she was like a supercomputer [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=615.3199999999999s)]
*  trying to basically diagnose the problems that he can solve and just the [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=619.12s)]
*  lineups keep changing over and over again. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=623.48s)]
*  They were bringing, it was almost like they were like a hockey team, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=625.24s)]
*  bringing dudes in and out the second quarter. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=628.12s)]
*  Um, I think okay. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=630.76s)]
*  See is going to win the title and I'd be really surprised that they didn't, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=633.24s)]
*  but the seeds were planted for how it wouldn't happen where you need a team [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=638.0s)]
*  that would just be able to go toe to toe with them and make them nervous. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=641.64s)]
*  Like they were at parts of game six, like they were in that first quarter [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=644.3199999999999s)]
*  today and you leverage their youth against them, I guess would be the recipe, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=647.88s)]
*  but I, I just don't see anybody beating them. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=652.8s)]
*  I think they're, I said this to you last week. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=655.48s)]
*  I think, uh, I think what they do on defense is the best thing anyone's doing right now. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=657.6800000000001s)]
*  And I don't, I don't, could there be, I'm trying to think of like the next, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=664.4000000000001s)]
*  like those five guys, the way they played in the second half of game four, the way [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=669.44s)]
*  they played for all the game six, five guys that have not, I don't think have [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=673.1600000000001s)]
*  gotten a ton of reps together as a five, as a healthy five song, maybe, maybe [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=676.7600000000001s)]
*  there's a ceiling there that, um, maybe game six is a little more representative [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=682.96s)]
*  of that, maybe Indiana, their depth and. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=686.88s)]
*  You know, how their style of play and just their pace and how comfortable [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=690.08s)]
*  they are all playing with each other. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=693.2800000000001s)]
*  Maybe that could be something. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=694.44s)]
*  And maybe Minnesota with, uh, with the ant piece and then the Randall, um, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=695.72s)]
*  just really punishing anybody who's, um, smaller than him. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=702.2800000000001s)]
*  Maybe there's some level there, but I can't see anyone touching. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=706.2800000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=709.9200000000001s)]
*  See, can you. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=710.1600000000001s)]
*  No, you're right. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=711.0400000000001s)]
*  Like when you think about football teams, you go, which is the best unit. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=711.8000000000001s)]
*  Um, okay. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=715.1600000000001s)]
*  See defensive unit and the numbers are back it up. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=715.8000000000001s)]
*  And I think the other part of it is the thing that you loved about them all [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=718.44s)]
*  regular season is this team can go one big, they can go two bigs and both bigs [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=721.52s)]
*  actually compliment each other. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=725.12s)]
*  They don't have zero base. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=726.2800000000001s)]
*  We found out today they don't need big Alex Caruso as a six, four center. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=727.52s)]
*  There's times where, you know, it gets Memphis. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=733.72s)]
*  It didn't really matter, but then I remember, I think it was even in game [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=736.2800000000001s)]
*  one with Dagnall where I'm thinking like he's coaching this game, like he's [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=739.92s)]
*  down 20 because he experimenting in game one for the rest of this series. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=743.12s)]
*  And then they have that small lineup today just to kind of pour on their adaptability. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=748.8s)]
*  And so whenever you look at the playoffs, you're like, Hey, they're deep. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=754.16s)]
*  They'll do all this stuff. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=757.08s)]
*  It's like, yeah, you really only want to play seven games or excuse me, seven [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=757.72s)]
*  guys and, and be who you are. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=761.32s)]
*  That's. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=763.96s)]
*  That's completely like removing the thing that I've liked the most about them. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=765.16s)]
*  All season long is on paper and based on watching them play all season long. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=769.92s)]
*  Um, their depth or sometimes we can overrate the depth part of it a little bit. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=776.4s)]
*  Like I was still surprised in the Pacers. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=779.84s)]
*  I'm like, they're in these playoff games and they're playing 10 guys in the first [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=781.3199999999999s)]
*  quarter, like that's, that's unheard of. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=783.9599999999999s)]
*  And it's working for them. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=786.92s)]
*  Maybe it's because of their style. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=788.1999999999999s)]
*  And again, we'll see what happens here with the Knicks, but, um, you know, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=789.4399999999999s)]
*  with the Knicks, but, um, there's part of me because I thought, okay, see, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=792.68s)]
*  it was so good had they lost this game. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=796.7199999999999s)]
*  It's like, so do I have to just completely eliminate teams that have all this [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=798.3199999999999s)]
*  malleability with their roster because that is their greatest strength. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=803.3199999999999s)]
*  And I think we saw that in this series. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=807.2399999999999s)]
*  Well, it's like, we say every spring when we're doing these, how many guys [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=809.4799999999999s)]
*  do you actually have, right? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=813.56s)]
*  I think the Knicks in that last series, they have seven guys now, now that [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=815.92s)]
*  Robinson can give them 15 minutes a game and McBride has been, I think, a [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=821.0s)]
*  really good bench player all season. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=825.28s)]
*  They have seven, which I think you can win the title with seven guys. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=827.36s)]
*  Indiana has 10. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=830.6s)]
*  We'll see if they get into a really hard series, how many people that number [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=832.72s)]
*  actually is, but it probably is eight, you know, and then maybe OB Toppin, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=836.6s)]
*  maybe that's nine, but you could work there. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=841.64s)]
*  Minnesota as a team. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=843.64s)]
*  I'm really interested to see what that number ends up being. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=845.72s)]
*  Cause you have Nas and go bear, you have a rando, you have ants. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=848.16s)]
*  There's four. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=851.52s)]
*  D Finchenzo, Conley, as the playoffs go along with his age, we'll see that's six. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=852.88s)]
*  Maybe Alexander Walker. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=861.36s)]
*  Yeah, well he's done. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=863.52s)]
*  That's some at seven and that's probably it. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=864.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=869.76s)]
*  See, they might have nine or 10. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=870.12s)]
*  I mean, I think Wallace, I, you know, I've loved him all year. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=873.32s)]
*  I always put him in my ringer 100 voting, even though I think he plays [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=876.84s)]
*  like 19 minutes a game, but, uh, I just think they're bringing dudes out. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=880.12s)]
*  Isaiah Joe's not even playing for them. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=885.36s)]
*  I really like Isaiah Joe Wiggins. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=887.76s)]
*  I really like, I almost feel like Wiggins is probably like, fuck, I could [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=889.88s)]
*  probably play 30 minutes for 20 teams in the league, so I guess that's what we're [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=892.88s)]
*  going to find out with, uh, with Minnesota because they're going to need everybody [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=897.8000000000001s)]
*  and they're going to be coming at Connelly. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=902.0s)]
*  They're going to be, they're going to be pressuring. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=904.4000000000001s)]
*  Um, and I, I don't think it's a great matchup for them. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=907.0400000000001s)]
*  What do you think the line is just out of curiosity for game one? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=910.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=913.76s)]
*  No. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=914.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=914.2800000000001s)]
*  Same Minnesota as a series. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=914.5600000000001s)]
*  Minus one 75. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=918.5600000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=919.64s)]
*  See, I'm going to say higher. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=919.88s)]
*  Um, I'm going to say minus 300 and the answer is, Ooh, minus 375. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=923.72s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=930.4000000000001s)]
*  Well, it would be a better chance than that. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=931.88s)]
*  Right? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=934.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=935.0400000000001s)]
*  I bet seems with the way Randall's playing, um, the first game one line. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=935.4000000000001s)]
*  It's huge. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=941.0400000000001s)]
*  I mean, I already looked at it because I was like, is there a game one [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=941.9200000000001s)]
*  scenario there where you go Minnesota easy path so far grind for OKC, having [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=945.1600000000001s)]
*  to play in Denver that whole time. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=951.44s)]
*  And the fact that the Western conference has the quicker turnaround than the [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=952.8800000000001s)]
*  Eastern conference on this one is brutal. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=955.5200000000001s)]
*  Um, but they had to do that in case there was going to be a game seven. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=957.8800000000001s)]
*  So it's minus seven and a half for the, for game one. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=960.08s)]
*  I mean, to me that screams Minnesota plus the seven and a half, you know, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=964.0s)]
*  like you're hoping to get OKC a little hung over from this series. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=967.5999999999999s)]
*  I, if I'm betting against OKC, I'm just betting the money line in a game. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=971.7199999999999s)]
*  Cause it feels like they just, they cover those bigger spreads and their [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=976.56s)]
*  defense, if they're up 10, if they're up 12, all of a sudden it's 20 before you [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=979.76s)]
*  blink, but the, I'd rather just take the go right against them. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQdEgkgYWpo&t=983.0s)]
