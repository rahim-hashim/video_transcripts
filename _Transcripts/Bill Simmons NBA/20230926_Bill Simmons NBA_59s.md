# Austin Rivers on How Long Jokic's NBA Career Could Last #shorts #billsimmons #nikolajokic #nba
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [September 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVjbjCEav20)
*  How long do you see Jokic playing? Do you see him being one of those guys who's like 39?
*  Nope. And just kind of holding on? No chance. No chance. I don't see him playing in the NBA until
*  he's 39 years old. But no way. It doesn't seem like he loves playing in the NBA now. Or he turns 29
*  in February. He won and he left. He was like, I mean, he didn't want to stay here because we
*  got a parade. He's like, no, no, I want to go home. What the hell? Well, we lost the last time I was
*  there, we lost the Golden State. I remember like two days later, three days later, I was grabbing
*  some stuff at the locker and I was like, uh, Yoke here. They're like, no, he left yesterday.
*  This is back to certain. This is like two days. He's gone, bro. Like he's out. I don't think he
*  really gives a s*** about the American like pop culture and trends and like fame and relevance.
*  Like those things just don't interest him like really deeply to a core. I don't see him hanging
*  around. He's already a champion. He's an all-star. He's an MVP. He just signed his second. Now he
*  just signed super max 35, maybe 36. I think he's gone.
