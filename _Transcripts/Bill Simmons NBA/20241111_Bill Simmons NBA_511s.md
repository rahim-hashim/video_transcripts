# Could Giannis End Up With the Nets?  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [November 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cv5kZtU4HGo)
*  I have this basketball thing. I didn't want to wait till Tuesday because I think it's important.
*  You know, Yanis, the Bucks lost against today. They're two and eight.
*  Yeah, what's up?
*  And I think the Yanis trade stuff is really going to start. People making up fake trades.
*  So as I said, I went to that Nets-Selfie game on Friday.
*  And the Nets are like pretty good.
*  You know, they don't have like, they traded bridges for all these picks.
*  They were supposed to try to tank. They got their pick back.
*  They have just a shitload of picks.
*  They have Ken Thomas, who I was really impressed by, who's a very good scorer.
*  They have Cam Johnson, they have Nick Klaxon, they have Schroder playing really well.
*  They have like a bunch of good, not stars, but like enough of a team that the team makes sense when you watch it.
*  Like they're good. They play defense.
*  I like them. I actually think they're a playing team at least.
*  I think they can just go all in for Yanis.
*  People are going to ask this week, who's the team that makes sense for Yanis?
*  They're going to be like, what about Miami? What about?
*  I actually think it's Brooklyn.
*  I think Brooklyn's going to be the team that trades for them because they can just overwhelm Milwaukee with all these picks.
*  They own their own first in 2025.
*  They own Phoenix's first.
*  They own the Knicks first.
*  They own Milwaukee's first, which is one through four protected.
*  If it's five or after, they get it.
*  So the Bucks can get their pick back.
*  They own their own first in 26 and 29.
*  In 27, they can swap with Houston or Houston can swap with them.
*  They own the Knicks first in 27.
*  They have Philly one through eight protected in 27.
*  They have their own.
*  They have Knicks first in 29.
*  They have another Dallas Phoenix Houston worst pick in 29.
*  They have all their own first.
*  They have a Knicks first in 31.
*  Like they just can say, Hey, Milwaukee, here's Ben Simmons is expiring contract.
*  And here are all these picks.
*  Just take all of them.
*  Take as many as you want and give us Yanis and put Yanis in Brooklyn.
*  I think it makes sense because I think Milwaukee needs to get out of this.
*  This game, Yanis thing.
*  I just think they have to trade them and trade Yanis and just they won the title.
*  Get out of this.
*  And to me, it's either Brooklyn or Houston because Houston's the other team that could they have picks and young players.
*  It's just like if I'm Yanis, would I rather go to Brooklyn or Houston?
*  I don't know.
*  So anyway, is it crazy to think Brooklyn could trade for Yanis?
*  Why not?
*  Well, could you go over there?
*  Picks they have one more time.
*  I was in the know.
*  But I just wanted to make the point how many picks they had.
*  How about this, though?
*  Here's the only way I could be helpful.
*  I'm looking at the nets to make the playoffs.
*  Twenty two to one.
*  Why would this is why I brought this up?
*  Because to me, it's conceivable that out of nowhere would be like, Oh my God, Brooklyn traded Yanis.
*  Brooklyn traded nine first round picks at Benson's contract and two swaps for this is the most picks anyone's ever given up for a player in the history of the NBA.
*  But then you look at Brooklyn.
*  So regular season wins right now.
*  Their overs 21 and a half.
*  You look for to make the playoffs.
*  Yes, is 22 to one.
*  Yeah, that's the bet.
*  To win the conference.
*  They don't have it for these right now.
*  But the point is, like, if you think Yanis is going to get traded, play them play Houston.
*  I don't think gold state has enough because walk is going to want to pick some that I think it's Houston or Brooklyn or the two teams that have all the picks.
*  So if they had odds for where Yanis is traded to, I haven't seen them if they do.
*  I don't think they do.
*  They wouldn't be 22 to one for the Nets, right?
*  They would not.
*  So this would be the bet.
*  Like, there would be like six to one for the Nets or something.
*  Houston's minus one twenty eight.
*  Houston has Houston made that trade.
*  They have Brooklyn's two thousand twenty six first.
*  They can swap Brooklyn in twenty seven.
*  They have a Phoenix first.
*  Twenty seven.
*  They own all their own bags.
*  They have a Phoenix or Dallas first.
*  Twenty nine. Like they have enough to put a Yanis thing together with some contracts.
*  Give them a young player.
*  The problem is they gave extensions to green and Shangoon.
*  So I don't think those guys can be in the trade.
*  But but they could patch up together.
*  But I think those are the two teams.
*  I think that I don't think Miami has enough.
*  Miami would have to put out a bio in it.
*  And if you're Miami, you're trading out a bio and all these picks to basically put Yanis on the same kind of team he's on now.
*  Right.
*  You're Brooklyn. You have all these role players you can put with them.
*  Then you have the cap space maybe to get some other guys.
*  You have shooting.
*  You play. I don't know.
*  Anyway, I just want to put my wife was in all the same things today.
*  Yeah.
*  Let me ask you this.
*  Yanis, if I would have told you second week in November, Yanis is 25 to one to win MVP and he's not not injured.
*  What would you have thought happened?
*  Like, what the hell would you think?
*  I would have thought he got hurt.
*  Yeah, but I'm sorry.
*  He's not injured like this is I guess you would just have they'd have no wins.
*  I guess is what you would have to think.
*  Well, the one thing is he'll never be 25 to one again.
*  No.
*  But let's say he got traded to Houston and they became like a four seed.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, those are the only two teams I can see because I'm going to go through everybody else.
*  I'm going to bet these the if you go through all the other teams, I just don't see another team because some people have thrown Golden State around and I don't see how they could do a trade that could compete with Brooklyn.
*  If I'm Brooklyn, I need to do I need to do whatever I can to get Yanis because I'm completely relevant.
*  But how much is this you're drumming this up or like there is a very big favorite that they hold up because I went to the game Friday and I was really impressed by the team they had.
*  No, but would they would they trade?
*  They're likely not going to trade.
*  Like what's the odds of David?
*  Oh, if it's like let's say they made me a consultant to the franchise.
*  No, like what do we do?
*  I would like trade Yanis and Dame right now.
*  Yeah, like you have no chance to win a title with this team.
*  Trade these guys.
*  Now you got the title from Yanis.
*  You have no picks left.
*  You have no path to ever be ever be a title contender with the group you have now.
*  Right.
*  Cut the cord.
*  Now try to trade for one of these teams before these picks go away to somebody else because the only thing is Oklahoma City and they're not going to do anything.
*  All right, I'll do 22 to one.
*  I mean, I have to.
*  It has to make sense that I lost the last seven minutes of my life.
*  I have to do 22 to one here.
*  I like it.
*  Listen, this will be a YouTube clip that gets at least 80,000 views.
*  So really so excited.
*  Really.
*  So really come in for a second.
*  Are you there?
*  No, I love sorority.
*  What's he doing?
*  What's up in the dark?
*  Brooklyn or Houston?
*  Is there anyone else?
*  I why does Janice want to go there?
*  Why does he want to go to Brooklyn?
*  Oh, that's the other thing.
*  Why does he want to stay in Milwaukee?
*  I mean, it just seems like he if he actually does like pulling the plug in this and I want to get out, he's going to have more suit.
*  I just feel like he's going to have the pull to be like, I don't want to go to Brooklyn, dude.
*  This is like the worst place in the NBA for me to go.
*  New York City.
*  Is it though?
*  Technically, yes.
*  I know.
*  Wow.
*  No state taxes.
*  Houston.
*  Houston's great.
*  Yeah, I mean, they have the assets like I mean, that'd be a great spot for him.
*  But I just I don't know why anyone would want to go to Brooklyn.
*  Damn, it's Rudy.
*  Golden State would be the other one if but I just don't know what the trade is with that.
*  Because they don't have the same kind of picks coming.
*  It's just it's not even close to what the other teams could get.
*  All right.
*  It has to be like, I want to be there.
*  Right.
*  Have to be had to trade me here.
*  But he just on a contract.
*  Essentially, what levers does he have?
*  I don't know.
*  I was thinking like, what if what if it was Anthony Davis and all the rest of the Laker
*  picks?
*  Oh, wow.
*  Man, what do they trade have to look like?
*  But I didn't even it was like this.
*  I didn't even want to open.
*  It's like the door in the attic that you don't want to open because there's some ghosts that's
*  going to those Lebron agree to it if they want Bronte.
*  If Milwaukee says we're only doing it if you throw Bronte, Bronte has to be the Bronte has
*  to be in the trade to make the salaries work.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  Those are the only ones you go through all the teams.
*  It's really hard.
*  All right.
*  Thanks, Rudy.
*  Thanks for water.
*  I'm sorry.
