# Will the Suns Silence the Doubters in the Pacific Division? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [October 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1ybarbrhxo)
*  All right. We did the first two divisions in the West and we saved the Mac Daddy one.
*  An impossible over under division
*  for last with the Pacific where Phoenix has the highest over under
*  52 and
*  a half. They are plus 130 to win the division. They're plus 550 for the title. They're plus 230
*  for the one seed. They were
*  45 and 37
*  last year. Before we get into the under over or
*  house.
*  How many more KD years are we getting? Like the real
*  badass KD years. He's 35 years old.
*  986 regular season games, 166 playoff games. He's played 43,000 minutes.
*  Got hurt in 2019. Missed all of 2020. Missed 37 games in 21.
*  27 games in 22. Missed 35 last year. And now he's 35 years old. He was in the
*  2007 draft.
*  Elite KD
*  over under a year and a half
*  under. What do you mean by years? Because what we're really talking about is can he be healthy in the playoffs?
*  But that to me is the only question that matters.
*  I don't care whether he plays 40 games in the regular season.
*  You want him to be healthy and able to score in the playoffs.
*  Which obviously is going to impact my assessment of the Phoenix Suns.
*  It sounds like maybe you don't like the 52 and a half as much. What are your thoughts, Rosillo?
*  Yeah, it's all about Duran. I'm gonna take the under and I like him.
*  You know, I feel like the weird thing is Phoenix has been kind of forgotten already.
*  Maybe because we didn't know how Beal fit in. But then when you looked at the price for Beal, you're like, why wouldn't you just do it?
*  The 8 and stuff, you know, I just think it was a frustrating fit. But when you look at the assets coming back for him, you're like-
*  You mean dominating?
*  Dominating. Because I think Nurkic sucks.
*  Me too.
*  You want real estate on my island?
*  Is that a unique island? Is it a small island?
*  We've taken shit from the Phoenix area.
*  I'm just surprised that people-
*  Our guy at EJ is mad at me.
*  Do they watch him? He doesn't play.
*  Also, he doesn't play. Gets hurt every year.
*  What's Phoenix gonna be mad about? They haven't seen him play?
*  They're like, oh, his passing and screening is so much better. It's like he doesn't play.
*  His passing and screening is a bench?
*  There was a time where I actually thought he brought something to the table.
*  And he's a pretty talented guy, but I mean, he doesn't play enough.
*  And I think when he's played defensively, he's been more exposed as his career has gone on.
*  He's gonna be exposed this year.
*  Well, I mean, even if I understand them moving on from Ayton,
*  which makes me question between the Ayton stuff and Kai Jones,
*  is the Bahamas the basketball pipeline we thought it was?
*  We have to reevaluate.
*  So that's something we can table for later in the season.
*  But I still think they're gonna be really good.
*  And if they're healthy, I think they're really-
*  This isn't a write them off thing.
*  I just don't know how you bank on-
*  I mean, even Booker gets dinged up a little bit now and then.
*  And I love the guys.
*  And Beal's not afraid to miss a few games.
*  Yeah, I feel like Beal's durability has-
*  90 games in two years.
*  90 out of 160.
*  Yeah, there's durability questions I have with this team.
*  I do like if they're just gonna play Duran at the five
*  in certain games where they need him and play Gordon as a starter.
*  I think defensively, I have real questions about this team.
*  And if your answer is, well, they're just gonna outscore anybody.
*  The defense doesn't matter. That's fine.
*  But I really don't trust KD playing more than 60 games.
*  We just haven't seen it.
*  If he did it, it would be the first time it happened since the late 2010s.
*  And I really feel like they're gonna need him to be a mid-50s win team.
*  They're gonna need his defense.
*  They're gonna need rebounding from him.
*  They're gonna need his point forward stuff.
*  And he's gonna have a really big burden.
*  I think him and Booker, there's no point guard on this team.
*  Bradley Beal's not a point guard. You already saw that house.
*  He's fine. He's fine. He can break the ball up.
*  They're gonna run the offense through Duran and Booker.
*  But then on the other side, they're gonna need Duran to get 10 rebounds a game.
*  They're gonna need Duran to be able to guard.
*  Who's guarding Jason Tatum on this team?
*  I honestly don't understand.
*  Who's guarding Luca on this team?
*  Booker's guarding Luca.
*  If the answer's Booker.
*  Like, Booker gets everybody other than Luca.
*  Who's chasing Steph Curry around screens on this team?
*  I guess you use one of the bench guys.
*  But, listen.
*  It's your thing. You've been saying this forever.
*  There's regular season teams.
*  And then where are you in the playoffs?
*  And to me, this is a classic.
*  I don't care about the regular season with this team.
*  I don't think they care about it.
*  They want to be where they are in the playoffs.
*  And 53's a lot of wins.
*  You need like 8, 10, 12 game winning streaks to get to 53.
*  And they're competing against teams.
*  Like even a team like the Celtics.
*  Tatum is durable as shit.
*  He doesn't miss games.
*  Ooh, a little teaser.
*  A little teaser for the over.
*  Those guys don't miss games.
*  If you're gonna say Porzingis is not that durable, I'm with you.
*  It's two completely different things.
*  I really like Phoenix.
*  I'm in on it.
*  I think there's a version of this with Vogel where it's not Monty Williams figuring out your rotation
*  while you're losing in the second round of the Denver Nuggets.
*  And you're like, hey man, do you have any idea what your sub pattern is here?
*  It's the second round.
*  Is Monty Williams the highest paid coach in the league?
*  I can't believe it.
*  Moving on.
*  Plus 550 for the title?
*  Intrigued at all?
*  Yeah, I like it.
*  I like it.
*  But there's also, this is, like I've come to the conclusion in the last two years,
*  I'm probably as pro-booker as anybody.
*  I just go, there's a motherfucker in him that's beyond some of the other guys that I hear
*  that are supposedly ranked higher than him in the NBA ranked stuff that we see.
*  And a lot of the NBA ranked stuff is very similar.
*  And yeah, the one is like, I'd rather have Booker than Tatum.
*  I'd rather have Booker than Shea Gilderis Alexander.
*  And I think there have been some moments here in the playoffs when he is like, fuck this.
*  I'm going for it.
*  That I don't see in other guys that are considered better than him.
*  And look, I mean, reasonable people can disagree about it.
*  So because of that part and hoping that Durant, like, hey man, this might be your last real shot at this
*  to get that ring that it would mean a lot.
*  He can pretend it's not going to mean, but like a ring post-Golden State for him.
*  Yeah.
*  Would mean a lot.
*  That's why he wanted to get traded to Phoenix.
*  Yeah.
*  But I'll be honest, like, even though the raw numbers are there and he and Booker like went crazy in two of those games,
*  there's some stuff with the way Durant was playing where it was like, dude, you're just getting yourself into these impossible shots.
*  And like a few go in, but this isn't, I hope this isn't what you plan on doing here offensively the whole time.
*  And I don't think Vogel will let that happen.
*  Well, that was why I said last year at some point how I thought if you just flipped, if you gave them Beale for that series against Denver,
*  you just put him in the Landry Schamet spot for five, six games or however long the series was.
*  I still think Denver beats them.
*  I do.
*  I don't think Beale would have swung it because they couldn't stop Denver.
*  Beale wasn't changing that.
*  So from a defensive standpoint, the team they have built, I still think Denver is going to be able to do whatever they want offensively against them.
*  Maybe they won't see them in the playoffs.
*  Who knows?
*  But I just think this will be who like, Yoke Edge against this team?
*  Well, everybody wants to tell you like Nurkic gets up for it.
*  It's like five years ago.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  And he had also had a major leg injury too that people gloss over.
*  How, if I told you Booker was 22 to one to win the title, I'm sorry to win the MVP.
*  If you did that bet with the over, that makes sense to me because if they go over this 52 and a half, that tells me Booker had a spectacular season that he became like one of the guys in the league.
*  Which I still think I'm with Rusilo as a playoff guy.
*  I love him, but he hasn't been that in the regular season.
*  There's really no point.
*  We spent.
*  He flirted with it though.
*  Didn't we have a top five vote for him?
*  Yeah, we did.
*  But he was never like, could Booker win the MVP?
*  I don't.
*  Well, there was one year where I think there was 12 different guys that were winning it.
*  It was ridiculous.
*  And he was at least in that mix.
*  But go ahead, Cal.
*  All we were saying is, you know, we just spent eight minutes talking about Phoenix and the entirety of the conversation is about their playoff fortunes and how they compete.
*  You know how they're going to line up against Denver.
*  This is not a team that's built for regular season success.
*  It doesn't make any sense.
*  So it's an under.
*  It's an easy under.
*  It might be one of my locks when we get to it.
*  Is their great offense going to be better than everyone else's anything?
*  Because you could say last year, why did Denver win the title?
*  Well, the Yokojima thing was the best thing anybody had, but they also got stops.
*  Each playoff game, they were able to summon some sort of stop.
*  They were never out of games.
*  Nobody ever blew them out.
*  Even that one Minnesota game, they're down by 10, 12 near the end.
*  They clawed back like they were just always hanging around because they were so efficient.
*  So if that's the case for Phoenix, that their offense is going to be so good, especially with Beal, that they're just going to always be hanging around these games and they could always rip off 10.
*  I just don't think they're in the class at Denver.
*  I don't see it.
*  It's an under for me.
*  What is it for you, Rosilla?
*  Under.
*  One last Phoenix question really quick.
*  If you got Ishbia, put like eight tequila shots on him and some truth serum.
*  And you're like, dude, like, you know, looking back, maybe maybe shot your wild pretty faster in the Durant trade.
*  Maybe you could have waited, kept bridges, maybe got Dame for like 60 percent.
*  We gave up for Durant, you know, bridges and Dame.
*  Maybe that would have been a better path.
*  What do you think?
*  What do you think he would say after eight tequila shots and true serum?
*  They should have bought the Cardinals.
*  I think he wouldn't waver one bit.
*  You have to recall the circumstances under which he took over the ownership.
*  The previous one was disgraced exit.
*  He had to rebuild the brand in Phoenix that the Phoenix area loaths arbor at the end of it.
*  And what you need as the new guy coming in is the bright flash.
*  It's Kevin f'ing Durant.
*  Like, Dave's nice.
*  It's Kevin f'ing Durant.
*  So that's that's the.
*  So you think he would?
*  You think, Rosilla?
*  I think that you don't think it'd be like maybe maybe I didn't get a little excited there.
*  Well, the thing that was crazy about the trade is that.
*  He kind of wasn't bidding against anybody.
*  Yes.
*  Remember, Durant had the audacity on top of everything else to be like.
*  And I want out and I don't want there to be any sort of competition for my services.
*  It's such a good point.
*  He was bidding against the server legacy.
*  Yeah, he's bidding against.
*  I think it's really hard, especially when you're an owner.
*  I mean, any owner, but like, hey, we get Durant.
*  I think about the teams that were trying to jockey for.
*  Boston was trying to jockey for it before the season.
*  Toronto, although people tell you like Toronto actually doesn't want to do anything.
*  They just want to draft and then.
*  Besides, like, you won the title.
*  I'm good.
*  The title is like a good time.
*  Actually, not going to trade any of these guys and let them leave free.
*  I think a tequilas would get you a little closer to the truth.
*  It's like, man, I kind of did give up a lot.
*  Man, they're super excited.
*  Super excited.
*  He was just sitting there.
*  But I also like, you know, if you're owning a team and it's like, you want Durant, you have Durant tonight.
*  Listen, game three and game four in that Denver series.
*  It seemed like the best trade possible.
*  Watching those two guys together.
*  You don't like that question, House.
*  Which question?
*  The question about Durant.
*  OK, do you think that question.
*  Tequila.
*  Do you think the tequila question is better or worse than when Sean Hayes and Smartless asked Bill.
*  Why he didn't play professional sports and covered it instead.
*  I did enjoy that.
*  Sean Hayes is a good guy.
*  Come on.
*  No, OK, it's for Sean Hayes.
*  But.
*  Well, I should have.
*  There was.
*  He's right.
*  Maybe I should have just played, been a professional athlete.
*  If you had answered that seriously and said, you know, looking back, I should have played in the NBA.
*  I didn't quite understand what it took.
*  The fact that nobody said a sound and you answered it straight.
*  Yeah.
*  That if I could have had a camera on me in my car listening to that question, because it just sort of out of nowhere.
*  Like, how come you didn't play professionally?
*  And you said.
*  I should have made up some sort of thing like why was you know, I was one of the best male gymnasts in Massachusetts.
*  Yeah.
*  And then I was just, you know, my body was because I was waiting for everybody to then pile on.
*  Right.
*  And it was it was so absurd.
*  Might have been edited.
*  No one said anything.
*  Los Angeles Lakers, forty six and a half.
*  Why didn't you play for the Lakers?
*  They're close.
*  I should have.
*  All right.
*  Forty six and a half.
*  Plus three seventy for the division.
*  A wager I may have already made.
*  Plus seven fifty for the conference.
*  Thirteen one for the title.
*  Plus eight fifty for the one seed.
*  They were forty three and thirty nine last year.
*  And that was after they started what?
*  One in ten and had the most dysfunctional October, November possible.
*  It just kills me.
*  You like them.
*  You think they're good and you like really like I really like them.
*  The most you've liked them.
*  And I really like the team.
*  I'd like what they did.
*  I like the assets.
*  The team makes sense to me.
*  I think they can survive LeBron disappearing for 15 games and they'd be OK.
*  I think they have a lot of trade assets.
*  House they they can they have the Russell contract.
*  Max Christie and hood Shafino.
*  They have two firsts.
*  Yeah they're first.
*  They kept that first.
*  Castleton.
*  That was the super frisky in December January.
*  And I just think this team is going to be really good.
*  I thought they were good last year.
*  I thought they were the second best team in the league by the end of the season.
*  And if you're going to tell me LeBron James this is year 21 and this is now the year
*  21 realistic I think it's actually pretty realistic that he can be still a top 30 guy in the
*  league and they use him as a D.H. anyway.
*  I thought they relied on him too much last year in the playoffs.
*  But to me I don't like that choice.
*  I would have done more Reeves.
*  I really felt like Reeves was cooking in that series.
*  Maybe this year Reeves gets more but I'm way over.
*  What are you Rossello.
*  I'm over.
*  I like this team a lot and I'm honestly pretty pretty blown away.
*  Like when you think about the job a front office can do.
*  Yeah.
*  To figure this out on a fly.
*  You know and then always like you better hope you don't get what you want because think how
*  different it would be without the depth and having Kyrie and it's like cool you got Kyrie.
*  And neither pick.
*  They would have lost both picks.
*  Yeah.
*  So it really comes down to this.
*  Like if Anthony Davis is going to play like playoff Anthony Davis where I couldn't I mean I had
*  like I like it was a PSA.
*  I watch him in that Memphis regular season game.
*  Yeah.
*  And I went I'm out.
*  I can't do it anymore.
*  I think he's done.
*  It's going to happen with Zion in like January.
*  Maybe.
*  But then as soon as I did it.
*  I guess.
*  Right.
*  But as soon as I did it like it's almost like he had to keep falling down and build up the
*  scar tissue to it.
*  And it was like so then when he fell down again people weren't joking like seven to ten days.
*  Yeah.
*  Like they would do a scores table every time he fell down.
*  So if Anthony Davis is close to being right and he was real right in the playoffs like
*  that's the whole point.
*  That's the reason why I freak out about this guy.
*  When a real conversation was happening is like would you just be better off trading him.
*  And the problem is is like if you want to trade him that means that he's been hurt so
*  much that you need to figure out something else.
*  That means is Mark.
*  So like the best version of this a lot of times is the patients.
*  And I like him.
*  I like the team.
*  I like the depth.
*  I mean look I'm not going to like to Angela Russell.
*  Everybody knows that.
*  But I don't think he's on the team in February.
*  Well that contract reeks of.
*  Yeah.
*  I think they made an agreement.
*  I think they wink winked it with him and like hey we're going to pay you extra and you might
*  not be on the team.
*  And then in February House Anthony Davis turns 31 in March.
*  He's made for all NBA teams none since 2020.
*  He's never even been top two in the MVP.
*  And yet he is considered to be one of the league's best players.
*  Is that justified.
*  Absolutely positively.
*  Yes.
*  OK.
*  What he did in delivering that team to the playoffs last year and putting them in a position
*  to get swept by Denver.
*  But those were by far the most competitive games of the entire NBA Finals.
*  So the entire NBA playoffs with the Lakers and Nuggets.
*  Those were the best games.
*  They were the most competitive games.
*  And there's a physicality they still have that they had last year that is going to be
*  a real problem for a lot of these teams.
*  Like when they play Phoenix that's going to be a fact.
*  If they're against Phoenix in a playoffs series that's going to be a fascinating matchup where
*  on one hand a lot of offense and on the other hand the Lakers are just going to be able
*  to overpower them.
*  I think they bully the F out of them.
*  Yeah.
*  They did it to the Warriors.
*  The Warriors had a real crisis.
*  It's the worst possible matchup of the Warriors.
*  Yeah.
*  Because you just knew like any time anything with any momentum even with LeBron towards
*  the hoop it was a good look.
*  And if Davis wasn't scoring a ton he was cleaning everything up.
*  It was kind of nice to see a big guy.
*  You know the Davis that we all fell in love with the reason why this guy was that important
*  was that hey he's the big guy.
*  Even though there's still some numbers with him we were like how come you don't shoot
*  it the way you used to shoot it or whatever.
*  Well they looked at they got the Reeves deal done for just the craziest possible contract.
*  He had an awesome team USA.
*  You know there's a Janobli I think kind of ceiling for him as a really really crafty
*  creative offensive guard who's not afraid of the moment who seems like he gets better
*  whatever stage it's in who's feisty.
*  Really really really special playoff player for where he came from where he wasn't even
*  drafted.
*  I don't know Rui Hachimora.
*  I don't know like they paid him.
*  Do you trust it.
*  All the feedback in the summer and the preseason was pretty good.
*  You have to trust it.
*  I think you think like all of these guys that they've acquired they're going to be different
*  players because of this situation with LeBron with Anthony Davis like you know I was as
*  skeptical as anybody of Hachimora.
*  You know good luck.
*  But the situation was so radically different for him.
*  It was a revelation and he he flourished like he earned the money that they gave him and
*  he gave them he kept that bully ball thing for them.
*  Vincent's like perfect.
*  It was so funny when they signed him really I was like as somebody who hates the Lakers
*  I was like oh god damn it really.
*  I got that guy too.
*  I think Rui is a little overrated because of the playoff games.
*  Sure.
*  He's still under 30 percent.
*  I don't trust him.
*  You know he's he's physically so much bigger at times you're like god damn is he big you
*  know and then he'll hit a couple of turnarounds.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know he went off a couple of the Memphis games.
*  But for the most part like you look at the numbers you're like how much did you have
*  to pay this guy again.
*  So I mean there's a reason why you know with L.A. it's going to be easier for him there's
*  not as much of a burden he's not a lottery picker he's in Washington.
*  But the fact that Washington could only get a second rounder for him I think speaks to
*  like a lot of the people turn the page on.
*  And there's only a couple of team places for him to go.
*  That's a deep team.
*  I have no idea if Christian Woods is going to play one meaningful minute for them.
*  Well no he'll play he'll play and he'll come in if he's with the second unit he's going
*  to make a bunch of shots.
*  It was a good risk for them.
*  Yeah.
*  LeBron is one of the greatest basketball players of all time and you want to throw different
*  people next to him that you know go either way.
*  Right and I bet you LeBron in a private moment after two months be like don't fucking play
*  this guy with me anymore.
*  Right and LeBron will be like get that guy out of here and they'll get him out or he'll
*  be like I like this guy and I'll take it.
*  Well no.
*  That won't happen.
*  They'll go I don't want to whenever you sub him in take me out.
*  LeBron sees him at the table and just starts walking to the bench.
*  LeBron has 1703 games playoffs regular season combined.
*  Sixty six thousand minutes getting close to that.
*  It's awesome.
*  It's not realistic anymore so I'm not going to do the thing.
*  It's become like Brady those last couple of years where you're like you know what I'm
*  out.
*  I'm out trying to figure out if this is the year when all of a sudden this isn't going
*  to happen anymore.
*  It's just is he going to play 25 years.
*  Maybe.
*  Well because it doesn't matter like anybody going well he's going to slow down like what
*  do you want.
*  You want your own TV show for that one like great but.
*  He can still go to the basket.
*  Right.
*  He's impossible to defend a referee.
*  He can get in the paint and do things he's.
*  He can coast and get.
*  Coasting gets.
*  Smartest guy in the league as a basketball player.
*  He can solve any issue.
*  But he doesn't have to like he almost figures out OK I'm going to go hard on the second
*  sub in in the first half.
*  I'm going to try these six minutes.
*  Right.
*  The third quarter when they put that sub in that's when I'm going to put my gear in.
*  I love the over.
*  This is going to be one of my locks.
*  I also really like the one seed bet for them plus 850 because I think this team has a chance
*  to be in the mid fifties.
*  I just like the value of it.
*  I'll just tell you that I'll reveal in the part three whether I pick Celtics versus Lakers
*  or Celtics Nuggets as my finals.
*  But those are the three teams for me and Milwaukee probably four.
*  I really like what they did.
*  Polinka you know that dude almost got fired 19 Magic completely threw him under the bus
*  that one summer.
*  LeBron was basically you know trying to force them to do all this stuff last year and give
*  away every asset they had and he kind of held the course he made some really good trades.
*  All right Golden State.
*  So we're all over on the Lakers.
*  How's your over over definitely over over over.
*  All right.
*  Golden State forty seven and a half plus three ninety for the division.
*  Last year forty four and thirty eight.
*  No playoffs for them plus three hundred if you want to say this goes badly.
*  Priscilla your guys in this team now.
*  Yeah.
*  You're 19.
*  Yep.
*  You'll be shocked to know that after it seemed like a part gamble on Chris Paul and a part
*  we got to get Jordan Poole out of here and we're getting an expiring contract for him
*  and let's just move on trade that he's been in the building and everybody's been like oh
*  wow Chris Paul's pretty good.
*  He's going to help us.
*  Wow.
*  This is going to be fun.
*  I was not shocked to hear that.
*  No but I definitely think long term like closing minutes knowing that Chris Paul.
*  Is not he does not play this way but I also think he's smart enough to go OK well you
*  got to figure it out but if you think of him starting or closing then it's like well which
*  three guys like how are you closing with those like I think there's a real play for thing
*  really worries me.
*  Yeah.
*  He doesn't rebound.
*  So now you're it's not like you have a room cleaning center anyway and now you're going
*  to have clay it doesn't rebound.
*  So what are you going to do Steph CP Clay Draymond Wiggins like you know and Louie and
*  you know and Looney is so good now that you almost think he deserves to close.
*  So then I think Looney's out.
*  I think and you have to tell Wiggins you got to rebound dude.
*  We're going small.
*  We're emphasizing creativity and Wiggins have to.
*  It's like in the finals like he rebounded in the playoffs in 2022.
*  So he's going to have to do that against good teams as much as I like my guy on a team that
*  I've had a lot of fun with.
*  I just don't think they're going to prioritize the regular season at all.
*  So I go under.
*  I totally agree with Rossello here.
*  Okay.
*  I am a big fat over.
*  Oh wow.
*  Inside Intel.
*  No they won 44 games last year and they were a fucking reality TV show.
*  Their season started with Draymond punching Jordan Poole in the face and then you think
*  you're removed.
*  You're removed.
*  I think last year's season from hell in every respect makes me think Kers telling you that.
*  No I'm just they were 44 and 38 last year.
*  I need four more wins.
*  Well Chris Paul is going to be better for them than Jordan Poole.
*  I also think.
*  God damn I can't believe I'm saying this.
*  I'm kind of in on year three cominga.
*  I'm kind of in.
*  I've been listen been studying.
*  Got a quarter of court chortle and.
*  Looks like those discovery properties were like yeah I'm looking at a place in Portugal
*  like cominga island like yeah I just got this.
*  No road or electric.
*  Cominga Island.
*  Taking a look.
*  I'm going to fly down there to check it out.
*  Moody your older.
*  I'll tell you this.
*  Always like Dario Sarich on like a really smart fun team.
*  I thought that was a sneaky one.
*  Clay in a contract year.
*  They've got the 48 wins once in the last four seasons.
*  It was the year that they went to the finals and won.
*  Yes this is what happened.
*  But they were 17th in defense last year.
*  This is the last hurrah for this team.
*  In the sense of I don't.
*  I don't know if Clay's going to be on this team next year.
*  And Bob Myers and that that ESPN did that countdown yesterday and Woj was talking about how they're not negotiating the extension.
*  And Bob Myers said something really interesting.
*  He's basically like this is one of the reasons I didn't want that job anymore because you build relationships with these people and then at some point you have to make tough decisions.
*  If you read between the lines you're like wow are you saying you don't think Clay's going to be in the Warriors next year because that was how I interpreted it.
*  I think they're all in on this season.
*  48 and 34 seems reasonable to me.
*  And I think there's a comingo wild card piece that I like.
*  And I'm in on this team.
*  So you're under Rosilla?
*  Yeah I'm under.
*  I think they're going to pace themselves.
*  And you're right like last year was a weird disaster.
*  They couldn't win on the road for like a team that you're like hey when they're good they're still pretty good on certain nights.
*  They were deeply unhappy.
*  Right.
*  The road stuff, the defensive stuff on the road.
*  Like wait are they actually going to be that bad?
*  So I get your overlook with it but I don't think they're going to care.
*  I think they are they with the Lakers are probably going to care the least or maybe even Phoenix.
*  I don't know.
*  I just think that some of these groups I don't think anybody cares about seating anymore.
*  I just don't.
*  What do you think?
*  It's an under for me as well.
*  And you know I think that's a good thing.
*  Well and you know the thing I'm more concerned about is the injury risk.
*  Like you know a bunch of these guys haven't played full seasons in a while.
*  So the Curry piece of this which we haven't really talked about.
*  This is the most fun LeBron legacy buster team because Curry would get his fifth.
*  Chris Paul would finally get a title.
*  And then Steve Kerr I think I have this right.
*  This would be his tenth title if they won.
*  Ten rings for him which puts him in like this.
*  It's like basically him and Phil Jackson.
*  Well does Red have ten?
*  Red had nine.
*  But then he got the GM ones.
*  I'm just saying player coach titles.
*  Player coach.
*  Okay so not GM.
*  So I'm just going to say this about Curry.
*  That was a pretty embarrassing season for them last year.
*  And then they get their ass kicked by LeBron.
*  And whether or not those guys are never going to admit it.
*  But those guys are in a little you know these are the two defining players of this generation for better and worse.
*  I just don't see him being like oh yeah well we don't care about the way.
*  I actually think they do care about kind of reclaiming some turf here.
*  And that's part of my case.
*  I hope you're right.
*  I just I think it's about the playoffs for them.
*  You know like one of Clay or Steph or Chris Paul one of these guys is probably going down with something at some point.
*  Forty-four and thirty-eight.
*  How many games did Wiggins miss?
*  I forgot to mention that part.
*  Thirty-seven games.
*  What half the season?
*  Thirty-seven games.
*  And I'd like coming guys.
*  I'm in on this.
*  They just got to play defense.
*  If you tell me that they're committed to playing defense.
*  If they're not going to be a league average defense then I might subscribe to your thing.
*  But I don't think they're going to do that.
*  Do you see them getting ambitious with the trade?
*  If they feel close January, February.
*  That was another thing I was thinking with the over.
*  Like would they trade Kaminga or Moody?
*  They have a bunch of picks.
*  They could get.
*  Trading for Wiseman maybe.
*  Bring them back.
*  Bring Wiseman back.
*  Unfortunately like I don't blame them for trying to see if they had anything with any of these guys.
*  But now like what do you think?
*  Now it's shit.
*  Especially when you have all these other teams like fuck it.
*  Take them.
*  Take all my picks.
*  Take all my swaps.
*  Take every young guy I have.
*  But who's the player that.
*  I hate doing this on the fly because it's just so hard.
*  I just say Siakam now for every fake trade.
*  Mr. Siakam.
*  Siakam is a good one.
*  Except Toronto.
*  Just be like no.
*  Don't want to trade him.
*  I don't know who fits that profile because that's the part of the Chris Paul thing where it's like a get off pools money.
*  I don't think they want to just do an expiring.
*  You know it's a lot like the D'Angelo Russell thing where that saved the salary slot knowing they were losing Durant for nothing.
*  And that flips into Wiggins and then the pick later on and all that stuff.
*  So I don't know if the Chris Paul part of it's like hey the pool deal was way too much.
*  We actually get to reset the deck here a bit once Chris Paul expires or if they go you know what.
*  This didn't really fit basketball wise.
*  Well I think that's part of the trade right.
*  If it gets to January or February and they're like eh.
*  He's right.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you think the clay extension turns into a little bit of a soap opera.
*  Like Bob Myers was saying on the show last night he's like this guy's going to have a statue outside the Chase Center.
*  So you just have to when you're negotiating extension with somebody you just have to factor in that part.
*  This guy is eternal for the Warriors.
*  You can't fuck around with this.
*  But of course like I want another three years and 40 million apiece.
*  Like I just don't think they're going to do it.
*  I don't know.
*  That one's tough.
*  Let's take a break.
*  They shouldn't.
*  They shouldn't.
*  Right.
*  All right.
*  I know I've said this a couple of times already but the single toughest team for me was the Sacramento Kings.
*  I have flip flopped on this 130 times.
*  They're over under 44 and a half.
*  They won 48 games last year and everybody's back.
*  They added Vasenkov.
*  They traded for Chris Duarte.
*  Keegan Murray is a year older.
*  The teams a year later and playing with Mike Brown and playing together and all indications seems they're not going to drop five wins.
*  But the West is so good.
*  They've been they've been in under for some people.
*  Minus 230 for the playoffs.
*  Plus 180 for the no playoffs.
*  I landed on overhouse but I flip flopped on this 10 times and they're probably it's probably going to come down in the final two games.
*  I just think the conference is better.
*  Not not breaking any ground with that.
*  But we do this thing sometimes with the conferences where we talk about last year.
*  Well, they won all these games last year and you know, Phoenix was a mess most of the season.
*  The Lakers started off super slow.
*  The Warriors you go through.
*  You know, conference was a mess this year.
*  It's not going to be as much of a mess.
*  So that would be the case.
*  There are five wins less.
*  I'm going to take them over as well because I think they're going to win 45 games.
*  Yeah, they're going to be right there.
*  And I am not going to not like the beam.
*  That's the thing.
*  I can't not like the beam this upcoming season.
*  They earned it.
*  They are horrendous defensively.
*  Yeah. And they are not going to improve.
*  They haven't their rosters and built for it.
*  But I still love the offense and they have to have continued good injury luck.
*  They didn't. Injury luck was great last year.
*  Yes. A lot of guys miss.
*  Yeah. That's a key a key element of it.
*  Rossello.
*  I know how you keep pointing to like the West eventually became an absolute mess.
*  But we can't just project best case scenario for like the 12 teams that we all think are good.
*  But clearly Vegas and putting these numbers out like I was just dying laughing going.
*  There's eight teams here within a game or two of each other.
*  And it's all right around this 45, 46 number.
*  I know they don't play defense.
*  I know they had great health luck, but they're still young enough.
*  I think they're going to be a motivated team throughout the year.
*  I think Mike Brown did a really good job of kind of changing up what they would look like to even close games,
*  which is hard for a guy who's kind of doing it for the first time.
*  And even if it feels like Sabonis is a bit exposed now, like he had he kind of had a playoff moment where you're like, wait, what's this now?
*  Granted, his his hand was like his hand was fucked up.
*  Everybody's like, that's just falling off.
*  You're right. I'm glad you brought it up.
*  You brought it up, too.
*  Right. So I just I think they're too young and it's too new for them to kind of coast.
*  Yeah. So give me the over.
*  And they have a great home crowd that's going to be treating every single home game like it's.
*  Murray will be better. Yeah.
*  They got Duarte, which I really liked.
*  I like the over. I don't.
*  I really did worry that they just got passed by a few teams because I agree with what you said.
*  Like every year there's weird random stuff with conferences.
*  But when you think like Phoenix and the Lakers are just going to be so much harder to play, you just take those two and then the bottom of the conference is better, too, because they've just Houston, San Antonio, Utah, like all those teams added talent.
*  So could you could we go down a very quick sub tangent?
*  Yeah, I like them for the in season tournament.
*  You haven't really talked about that yet.
*  OK, they're in a pod.
*  The other teams in their pod.
*  I was getting you excited about this.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Well, now I'm looking it up and the point that you guys just made about how important that that home court situation is there.
*  They are going to try in the regular season.
*  That was their identity last year.
*  That's not going to diminish if they're healthy and they're trying.
*  I like them.
*  17 to 1.
*  I like them in this in season tournament.
*  The in season, they kind of stacked it where it's probably going to be.
*  Most of the best teams, there might be one outlier, but you might get like an Orlando or somebody weird in there.
*  But for the most part, it would be like seven of the eight best teams or six of the eight best teams.
*  And who knows?
*  But yeah, the odds on Fandel for them, they're all like plus nine fifty or higher for any in season team.
*  What's interesting about what you said about the overrunners, Rossello, when they came out, they made the West too high and they made the play out.
*  They had too many kind of yes playoff odds and it was just kind of and there was all these opportunities.
*  Sacramento is one of the teams that I think that one dropped by by a game.
*  I think Golden State dropped by a game.
*  Minnesota dropped.
*  Memphis dropped like Philly was at forty nine and a half.
*  Now it's at forty seven and a half.
*  So they kind of made them too high and then dropped when they realized, oh, shit, there's too many good teams.
*  But this feels like mid 40s to me.
*  All right. We all went over it.
*  Did you crunch the Senkoff tape over the summer or no?
*  No.
*  Bearded bearded first team all star for you or second team all beard?
*  I was just waiting for George to play Mizzou first.
*  OK, then we're on it.
*  You seen him?
*  I don't know what his game is.
*  He's like this tall, kind of crafty, fills the lane.
*  He's just like a classic.
*  You could see that he was a Euro League MVP.
*  I don't know if it's going to translate.
*  I don't know.
*  I wasn't able to figure it out.
*  Clippers.
*  Well, I'd be happy to get somebody good because recently I feel like these vets that come over the Euro guys compasso.
*  I hated him within minutes.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, who's this fucking guy?
*  There's this Mishich on Oklahoma City.
*  Yeah. But these guys are better.
*  These guys are better than some of these dudes that have come over.
*  Fontenaccio.
*  Like what?
*  Like I actually just went to Illinois.
*  Clippers forty five and a half.
*  They're minus 230 to make the playoffs plus 196 not to.
*  Just one of my favorite.
*  No, thanks.
*  I have one rule.
*  I'm not going to be wrong on the over with them.
*  No way.
*  I'll be wrong on the under.
*  I will not be wrong on the over.
*  Couldn't agree more.
*  I mean, we're going to just jump right to it.
*  Fuck these guys.
*  They don't care.
*  So I don't care.
*  In Tailu.
*  Right.
*  That's all.
*  All I thought is like the most definitive of the 30 teams.
*  I go, I don't care if I'm wrong, but I care if I'm wrong that I had hope.
*  Very fair.
*  They have probably the worst centers in the league.
*  They have Russell Westbrook in a prominent position and it's a team built around two guys who don't play that much.
*  The Kawhi numbers are jarring.
*  I like Plumlee against Jokic.
*  Okay.
*  I mean, I'm not saying just now crunch the Plumlee tape.
*  He gets into it.
*  He's excited.
*  Last six years, Kawhi missed 73, 22, 15, 20, 82 and 30.
*  Those are his miss game stats.
*  Paul George last four years, 24, 18, 51 and 26 miss games.
*  It's a bit like remember the Kyrie thing where he was barely playing.
*  Like he played like once every 10 games.
*  Everybody in the business was like freaking out going, how can he do this?
*  It's like actually because he doesn't play all that often.
*  Imagine being this fresh all the time.
*  Then Kawhi steps up in that Phoenix series before he gets hurt again.
*  And you're like, oh my God, is he going to do this again?
*  Is Phoenix going to lose?
*  Because Kawhi's like going nuts.
*  And then it becomes this compliment that you can go that long without playing.
*  It should be the other way around.
*  Like no shit, you look so fresh.
*  Like I could have taken house on my morning power walk today and you could have done 90 minutes.
*  And be like, look at house fucking walking around LA.
*  Tomorrow you would have been like in a hospital bed.
*  But today you could have done it.
*  I am a hard under on this team and it's a possible luck.
*  I think at the 45 and a half is ridiculous.
*  And people are talking about George and Kawhi like it's 2020 and it's just not.
*  And if they get there, great.
*  But I'm not going to bet on that or pick it.
*  A GM and the GM survey still picked him to win the West.
*  Like some people cannot quit this team.
*  Also their depth is like pretty overrated.
*  Like Covington and Morris and.
*  Remember last year at the beginning of the year, it's like, oh, this is the most talented team in the league.
*  And you're like, what?
*  There's a below average player.
*  I like Norman Powell a lot.
*  Me too.
*  I like Kenyon Martin Jr.
*  It's going to look good on the Sixers.
*  Batum, you know, it's still happening, I guess.
*  Bones Highland.
*  Like if we went out for drinks with Ballmer.
*  And Ballmer is like, oh man, like I can have Harden.
*  It's basically Powell and my unprotected first.
*  I wouldn't trade Powell straight up for James Harden.
*  Yeah.
*  Just so you know.
*  Right. So we would be at the bar with them and be like, wait, Powell.
*  And an unprotected first.
*  And they also want Terrence Mann.
*  Like, I can tell them to fuck off.
*  They have no other suitors.
*  Like that's ridiculous.
*  Also, like, have you watched James Harden in the last 12 playoffs?
*  I don't understand, like, because it keeps feeling like it's going to get done.
*  I mean, I don't know if you agree with me or not.
*  Well, because they have the new stadium next year.
*  They don't want to be irrelevant.
*  But I love this.
*  I love this new stadium thing.
*  It's true.
*  Hey, does this make any sense?
*  Is there anything that makes sense here?
*  Does it make sense to invest in him?
*  Does it make sense?
*  Does it make sense?
*  Like, as a guy, like, but we're moving into a new stadium.
*  Well, what does it mean if I'm moving into a new house?
*  It's like you can't run ads and say we have our unprotected picks and 27, 28, 29 Clippers basketball.
*  Come get it.
*  You can't.
*  It's like, look at James Harden.
*  2018 MVP.
*  Kawhi Leonard, 2019 finals MVP.
*  It's the wrong way of doing business, though, just because you're moving into a new arena.
*  It's like, hey, if two guys aren't playing, this guy shits down his leg.
*  We literally just had this conversation about Phoenix, though.
*  That's why I went out and did what he did for.
*  These guys have not proven they can play for nine months.
*  Yeah, that's a joke.
*  They just look.
*  It's a hard, under-for-meaning.
*  Whatever you think of the Phoenix transactions, it's nothing like potentially like, hey, if you want to grab Harden four years ago, I get it.
*  I get it.
*  Not for me, but I get it.
*  If they didn't have Westbrook, I would be like, all right, I can do it.
*  I would be like, all right, I kind of see it.
*  You do?
*  No, no, no.
*  I wouldn't do it either way.
*  But they also have Westbrook.
*  What's the point of putting Harden and Westbrook on a team together?
*  That's insane.
*  Comedy.
*  And I'm here for it.
*  So comedy-wise, content-wise, podcast-wise, it's phenomenal.
*  I recommend it.
*  I meant to ask you if you thought the Lakers would say fuck it and trade for Harden in February.
*  If it was like Russell and a contract and nothing else.
*  Just like.
*  That's not crazy.
*  It's not crazy, right?
*  That's not crazy.
*  Because I was trying to think, is there any other Harden team?
*  And that's like, that would be an interesting Lakers swing.
*  Anyway.
*  By the way, I don't think it's crazy because I just think the stars are really terrible GMs.
*  And they'd be like, yeah.
*  So they'd say, hey, LeBron, what do you think of Harden?
*  I love him.
*  Right.
*  He's one of my best friends.
*  Right.
*  Bucket-getter.
*  I was talking to my sister, Asia Wilson, about her.
*  She's a great friend.
*  She's a great friend.
*  She's a great friend.
*  She's a great friend.
*  She's a great friend.
*  She's a great friend.
*  She's a great friend.
*  She's a great friend.
*  She's a great friend.
*  She's a great friend.
*  She's a great friend.
*  She's a great friend.
*  She's a great friend.
*  She's a great friend.
*  She's a great friend.
*  She's a great friend.
*  She's a great friend.
*  She's a great friend.
*  She's a great friend.
*  She's a great friend.
*  She's a great friend.
*  She's a great friend.
*  She's a great friend.
*  She's a great friend.
*  She's a great friend.
*  She's a great friend.
*  She's a great friend.
