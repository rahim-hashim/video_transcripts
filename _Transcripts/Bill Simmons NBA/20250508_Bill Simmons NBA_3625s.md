# Best NBA Playoff Guys, the Non-Curry Warriors and a Huge New York Weekend | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE)
*  All right. We're recording this a little after eight o'clock Pacific time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=0.0s)]
*  Big Wise is here. Joe House was supposed to be here. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3.6s)]
*  I think he sprained his MCL because he got injured. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=6.08s)]
*  Uh, somehow anytime House is on any other podcast, his Zoom works. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=10.72s)]
*  And then when he's on mine and it's later at night, no Zoom. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=14.72s)]
*  I'm just going to assume alcohol. That's, that's where I've landed. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=18.16s)]
*  A lot of martinis for the big guy. I'm not surprised by that. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=21.28s)]
*  Well, he's got a big lottery coming up with the wizards on Monday. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=25.6s)]
*  Ah, yes. Yeah. I want to get your, your thoughts. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=28.72s)]
*  I'm talking to my dad later about Celtic snakes, but I obviously want to get your thoughts as well. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=32.0s)]
*  We stayed up to watch Minnesota Golden State. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=35.84s)]
*  I don't know what made me think that this might be a good game. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=38.72s)]
*  I'll start here. Is Steph actually the non-yokeage MVP when you see what somebody's team looks like [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  when they're not on it? Is there a more dramatic, oh God, then Golden State without Steph? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=50.08s)]
*  It's really crazy because their offense isn't elite when Steph is there. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=55.92s)]
*  It's like he's propping up a bunch of mediocrity and to see him not be there, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=61.68s)]
*  Jimmy on half an ass cheek, it's just pedestrian. That's just what it is. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=68.0s)]
*  Like it's just a pedestrian offense and Minnesota is one of the best defenses in the league. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=73.04s)]
*  So I'm not surprised that they kind of grinded the dubs offense into dust. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=78.72s)]
*  They got the game they needed already. So this was the gravy game. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  That's part of it too. Yeah. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=88.16s)]
*  Draymond tried to get himself kicked out. That also happened, which is a tradition like none other. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=90.0s)]
*  I texted you in house and again, RIP house apparently couldn't make the pot, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  but I texted you guys literally five minutes before. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=100.72s)]
*  It was five minutes. I checked the timestamp. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=103.44s)]
*  Yeah, because I was like, I wonder what quarter Draymond might try to get himself kicked out [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  of this game. And then he did the swing the arms thing and Stan Van Gundy, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=110.0s)]
*  let me get the exact quote. Hold on. I'm not sure there was any intent there. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=115.04s)]
*  Stan Van Gundy watching the Dahmer mini-series episode eight as Dahmer's eating somebody's [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=122.8s)]
*  genitals. I'm not sure there was any intent there. Who knows what Draymond, but he is in [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=127.44s)]
*  the first team all NBA of swinging his arms into somebody's head. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=134.56s)]
*  Yeah. One of the best in the league at it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  Like a lot of people exaggerate contact, but nobody routinely connects with the head [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=141.28s)]
*  of the guy that's guarding them as consistently or the nuts as consistently as Draymond Green. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=148.24s)]
*  Well, Draymond got the game he needed to win. I guess the bit, the bigger question for him is [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=157.36s)]
*  this technical foul tally that you would figure after 2016, he might be more aware of from a big [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=161.44s)]
*  picture standpoint because now I think it's two more and he gets suspended for the next game. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  So he's got to get the tech to go to work with. I still haven't figured out what distinction [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=174.56s)]
*  they're making on the tech and the flagrant to like, yeah, there's no rhyme or reason. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  It feels like it feels like they're cutting the guy a break as to not get him kicked out of the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=186.72s)]
*  game for the crazy stuff that he's doing. But like their explanation leaves me wanting like [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=190.88s)]
*  pretty much every single time. Yeah, I agree with that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=196.48s)]
*  Kaminga in this game tonight. Did you ever own property on Kaminga Island? Did you look, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=200.72s)]
*  which is going red fan and check out some houses? What was your plan there? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=207.04s)]
*  Very early on, I would say I was definitely like, look, this guy is athletic. He plays with a motor. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=211.44s)]
*  He's huge. Like this is an exciting kind of young guy that, you know, within Steve Kerr's [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=220.88s)]
*  system would be fun if he would develop. But I would say beginning last year where it's just like [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  it's obvious. First of all, he went to the press complaining about Steve Kerr. Steve Kerr was like, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=232.72s)]
*  I whatever effort we're going to put this guy in. But it's obvious you're not like that, by the way. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=238.96s)]
*  I don't think Steve Kerr was a huge fan of the complaining to the press. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=246.24s)]
*  Basically going over my head. He's not some creator, right? Like he's just not. And he's [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=249.2s)]
*  just refused to make himself into just a great role player, just a dare I say a GP too. Like [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=255.92s)]
*  look at what this guy does. Great cutter, great rebounder, great defender, just shoots open shots [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=263.76s)]
*  when it's swung to him. Like hits the break. Like he uses his tools to the best of his ability [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=270.24s)]
*  to fit into what Golden State's trying to do. Kaminga basically does none of that and thinks [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=276.0s)]
*  that he's Kobe. And it's just like, I don't know why I should still be excited about him. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=280.48s)]
*  You know where he's, here's how you why you should be excited. If somebody on his team who's really [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=285.2s)]
*  important gets injured and he has to play minutes by default becomes exciting because he walks out [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=289.6s)]
*  there and he's like, finally I get to battle with Anthony Edwards, my peer. Nobody but me and Anthony [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=295.36s)]
*  Wonders understands what we have as a connection as rivals and he just goes head dead with them. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=302.72s)]
*  Did you think even without this curry injury, did you think Golden State had a real chance in this [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  series? Yeah, I mean, you mean pre-injury? Did I think that? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, absolutely. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=317.20000000000005s)]
*  Just because the Wolves are just collectively not the most highly executing team, right? And the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=325.12s)]
*  Dubs are the opposite. These guys are veterans with insane playoff know-how collectively and, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=335.52s)]
*  you know, they have a great coach. And so I was just like, just based off of that alone, I thought [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=344.56s)]
*  the Dubs would give them a great series and had a definitely had a chance. I'm not going to say I [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=349.76s)]
*  thought they were going to win. I just assumed Minnesota's size would eventually end up being [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=354.32s)]
*  too much and Anthony Edwards playing more like he did in the second half of game one throughout [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=358.8s)]
*  the series. I just assumed Minnesota would eventually wear these guys down, but now it's [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  hard to see it. And, you know, I know they said they're going to reevaluate in a week. That's not [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=370.32s)]
*  how hamstrings work. This guy's not coming back in a week. No, hamstrings, calves, groins, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=374.08s)]
*  and they always do the at least a week or at least 10 days. And it's, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=381.2s)]
*  you know, it's never, it's not good. It's too bad. But on the other hand, here's the thing. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=385.68s)]
*  He's 37 years old. They just had this war against the Rockets for seven games, right? And that game [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=391.44s)]
*  seven is worth a game and a half of playoff kind of minutes intensity. It's like a, it's like a three, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=397.36s)]
*  it's like 150% of a game, right? And then he immediately gets hurt and game one of the next [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=404.72s)]
*  series. And that's what happens when you're relying on 40 year old LeBron and 37 year old [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=409.6s)]
*  Steph Curry. And you're relying on guys who have played a million playoff games is the variance [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=414.24s)]
*  becomes a little dicey, right? But then, you know, I was talking to some warriors friends and they [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  brought up something that I thought was kind of pretty, you know, head, head on. The, the dubs [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=424.8s)]
*  came into the season thinking these young guys were somehow going to be competent enough [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=433.28s)]
*  to make this thing work. And then like pods and coming on. Yeah. And they make this trade [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=439.91999999999996s)]
*  for Jimmy Butler. Finally, they get Steph some help. Only they have to treat the last like 25 [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=446.79999999999995s)]
*  games basically like playoff games. So they've been going all out, essentially since February. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=452.71999999999997s)]
*  And it's hard for me not to believe that that didn't play a role in why Jimmy, I mean, excuse [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=461.03999999999996s)]
*  me, why Steph ends up straining his hand me because he's been going pedal to the metal [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=466.88s)]
*  for months now and shouts to Joe house, man. Welcome to the welcome to the BS podcast, brother. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=471.84s)]
*  Joe house. He's just staring at, oh no, he's in choppy internet. This is great house. You're [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=477.59999999999997s)]
*  only on nine ringer podcast, but somehow when you come on mine, it's like you're in a log [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=482.47999999999996s)]
*  cabin in Sturbridge, Massachusetts. Well, uh, I don't know if you're going to hear this or not, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=486.96s)]
*  but only one podcast uses, well, I don't even know if I should name names because [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=493.52s)]
*  I'm going to, this is my fault. I was asking for it. Every podcast that I am on uses the same [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=500.32s)]
*  platform. No issue whatsoever, except for one. It's this one. I won't, I won't name names using [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=507.2s)]
*  zoom. Like what are you talking about? Like you want a riverside riverside is seamless and perfect. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=516.56s)]
*  Nobody has an issue with zoo with riverside. Can you tell us what year your computer is that you're [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=523.3599999999999s)]
*  using? Like honestly, give us the year. Did you purchase that computer? How old is the computer? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=529.76s)]
*  It's probably 2016. That would be like, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=535.1199999999999s)]
*  my God, that's insane. Trump presidency year one, the first one. That's how this came in 2016. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=540.72s)]
*  I do have a modern setup. The problem is that my modern setup is in my house above where my [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=550.8000000000001s)]
*  teenager sleeps. And so it's 50 50 where I can go up there and hoot and holler the way I like, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=557.5200000000001s)]
*  or do I use this remote setup, which most of the time works, but it could be how close we are to [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=563.5200000000001s)]
*  the booze. I mean, the booze is right over my left shoulder. That could have something to do with it. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=569.44s)]
*  So many articles about the explosion of video pods. And then house calls in on his Commodore 64 [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=574.8800000000001s)]
*  to get ready. House, I'm going to ask you the same question I asked was after you watched the [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=583.5200000000001s)]
*  Warriors game, like tonight is Curry the non-yoga MVP compared to guys who actually mean the most [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=587.2800000000001s)]
*  to their specific teams? Well, this was the case, you know, kind of all season long. The only way [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=594.0s)]
*  that Golden State was relevant to any kind of conversation was that bad man Curry. And I was [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=599.76s)]
*  very nervous at the beginning of the season, all the way up until the trade deadline, that this was [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=606.96s)]
*  a going away affair, that this was basically, you know, the year before the year for his retirement [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=612.16s)]
*  circuit because Golden State had no prospects whatsoever until Jimmy Butler fell into their laps. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=618.32s)]
*  And here we are. He can't play. So they're dead. Yeah. Well, I think that's it. But you know, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=625.5200000000001s)]
*  what's alive? Pat Spencer's facial hair, whatever is going on gimmick was what's going on here was, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=632.4000000000001s)]
*  can you walk us through? You've seen a lot of looks over the years. I know, I know you've taken [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=639.2800000000001s)]
*  some true delight in some different things. But where does Pat Spencer rank? First red flag is that [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=643.76s)]
*  terrible number. Why? I'm sure it's some tribute probably to a late family member or something [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=650.64s)]
*  like that. I'm sure there's something heartwarming to it. But bro, get a real Jersey number, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=657.3599999999999s)]
*  first of all. And yeah, he's clearly, you know, he's out there in the Bay Area with those folks. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=662.4799999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if he's micro dose some shrooms, you know, every now and again. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=670.32s)]
*  That would not shock me. That's what the that's what the facial and the hair is giving for me. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=676.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we might have to get him on the ringer. Here's my next question. When you watch Minnesota [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=681.7600000000001s)]
*  and Minnesota has looked pretty spotty in these two games, right? They're bad in game one. And [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=687.36s)]
*  even tonight, they kind of pick their spots and, you know, Edward sprained his ankle in the second [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=691.6800000000001s)]
*  quarter and then returned pretty quickly. But yeah, I wouldn't I wouldn't say they look sharp [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=697.68s)]
*  as hell. It made me wonder how good the Lakers were. I see I see it a little bit differently. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=702.2399999999999s)]
*  I think Minnesota is the kind of team that really does play up or down to their competition. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=708.88s)]
*  You know, they beat Denver like five times this season. You know, all of their OKC games for the [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=715.68s)]
*  most part have been fun. And Edwards is just a hyper competitive guy that way. And so I'm not [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=722.0s)]
*  surprised, you know, Steph goes down and they're kind of just dilly dallying and aren't giving it [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=729.84s)]
*  their best effort. But there were times today where you saw the team that we saw in moments [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=737.36s)]
*  against the Lakers. And so I think I think they they will give anybody a run for their money. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=743.12s)]
*  I'm talking about from the best teams left in the playoffs. Yeah. But they do have moments [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=749.9200000000001s)]
*  of just boneheaded basketball. And it's been like this basically for three, four years now. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=754.4s)]
*  So you don't think Pat Spencer and Quinton Post may be bringing the [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=760.0s)]
*  A game out yet? I don't even think Draymond's deep seeded and rooted hatred for Rudy Gobert [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=764.4s)]
*  is even going to be enough. They just can't do it without 30. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=772.88s)]
*  Yeah. How so where do you stand on Minnesota? They hurt our feelings because we had a huge bet [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=777.52s)]
*  before the series. You me, Sal and Hanch. We had Minnesota game one, Minnesota for the series. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=783.12s)]
*  Curry plays 12 minutes and we still somehow lose the game one bet. So I know I'm mad at them still. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=788.8s)]
*  I don't know where you are. Yeah, I have not forgiven them and I probably won't forgive them. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=793.76s)]
*  On the Lakers point, I think that the Lakers were an especially good matchup for Minnesota [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=799.28s)]
*  and vice versa. Minnesota was just a bitch of a team for the Lakers. And the way that Minnesota [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=805.92s)]
*  was able to hunt Luca and really expose Luca where he is in terms of his basketball, his [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=812.24s)]
*  playoff basketball readiness, he just wasn't physically there, Luca. And so they were able to [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=822.0s)]
*  exploit that. And what the Lakers had in terms of personnel, it was an incomplete team. And so they [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=828.56s)]
*  just ran those. They were exhausted. Luca and LeBron were exhausted every fourth quarter. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=834.72s)]
*  And Minnesota was able to exploit that. And you know, four one, that's very impressive. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=839.6s)]
*  But the way they showed up against Golden State, that's unforgivable. And I'm glad that Chris Finch [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=844.0s)]
*  called out Anthony Edwards. I think that was entirely appropriate. It's time for him to be, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=848.72s)]
*  you know, the leader that everybody wants him to be. He does set the tone and he can't let his [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=855.6s)]
*  missed jump shot, you know, his lack of confidence in his jumper impact the rest of his game. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=861.6s)]
*  Chris LeBron Luca was either exhausted or hungry. I don't know if we've decided [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=868.4s)]
*  both which one it was. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=873.6s)]
*  Anthony Edwards Hangry. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=874.8s)]
*  Chris LeBron Hangry would have helped him. Indy Cleveland. That's tomorrow night. I have no idea [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=875.6s)]
*  why I wasn't tonight. I have no idea why I only had one game. They really put, they should have [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=885.76s)]
*  moved this up once we realized Curry was out. But as I've said many times in the pod, I loved, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=890.0s)]
*  I loved Indy's chances in the series. I wasn't positive they're going to win, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=896.24s)]
*  but I really thought it was going to be a 50-50 series. They won game one, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=899.52s)]
*  game two, nobody plays. Mitchell has a heroic 46 minutes and cannot finish. And Indy steals in. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=903.84s)]
*  Hal Bern has this great moment and it's two-oh Indy heading back to Indianapolis. So Waz, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=912.08s)]
*  do you have more concern for the Cavaliers or the Boston Celtics, the team I happen to root for? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=921.36s)]
*  Waz Do I mean, I would say the Cavs by far, the Boston Celtics aren't missing two all [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=927.5200000000001s)]
*  NBA caliber players, right? And another guy who they've seen as their key deadline deal [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=932.72s)]
*  in DeAndre Hunter. So like, I think Mobley is going to come back from his injury. He'll [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=941.6s)]
*  probably be a little limited. It's an ankle. People come back from those and, you know, just [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=948.4s)]
*  gut it out. Garland, it isn't coming back. Like all indications are that that toe injury is horrible. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=953.9200000000001s)]
*  And coming into the series, I kind of felt like they could win the series even without Garland. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=962.96s)]
*  I did think they were that much better than Indy, but now you're down 0-2 and the guy who [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=968.1600000000001s)]
*  at many points of the season has been your best player is severely limited and hampered. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=976.32s)]
*  They got a whale of, you know, basically of a job to do to win four out of five games [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=982.08s)]
*  against this Pacers team that is just, they're clicking, man. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=991.52s)]
*  We know who agrees with you. Fandle because the Pacers are minus 194 favorites and the Celtics [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=995.3599999999999s)]
*  are minus 112 favorites. So I think it is way more bleak. One thing with that, that I thought was a [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1001.68s)]
*  sneaky piece of the Garland thing. I don't know if anyone else has mentioned this. He handles the [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1008.9599999999999s)]
*  ball for them a ton. And Indy's kind of a bitch to play with how they go 94 feet and they just hound [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1013.5999999999999s)]
*  you and they just, they really make you work the bops. And that was one of the things with [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1019.6s)]
*  Mitchell. He had to bring the ball up a lot. And then near the fourth quarter, it's like, all right, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1022.96s)]
*  I'm done with this. And other people were doing it. But I think Indy, it's weird because sometimes [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1027.52s)]
*  you'll watch them, they'll choke games away at the end. And you're like, how did they lose that? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1033.76s)]
*  Then other times they come late, almost like a boxer where it's like, wow, they're down on the [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1037.52s)]
*  cards, but they're throwing bombs right now. How do you, do you like this Indy team? Where do you [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1042.64s)]
*  stand on Indy? I really do. And we were on them after the, you know, the calendar flipped into the [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1046.72s)]
*  new year. We liked where their win total sat, the forecast for how they might end up the season. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1053.84s)]
*  And they've been as good as, you know, just about anybody over the last 50 games of the season. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1061.3600000000001s)]
*  Their record now is what? Like 36 and 11, something very good. Well, I think, weren't they like 35 and [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1068.0s)]
*  15 and then what they do in the playoffs, four and one now they're six and one in the playoffs. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1074.8s)]
*  So it's something like 41 and 16 in their last 57, something like that. Yeah, that's it. And so, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1079.76s)]
*  it's also the case that like, there are different kinds of beasts in the playoffs and the chops [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1086.8799999999999s)]
*  that they acquired by way of making it to the Eastern Conference finals can't be overlooked. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1093.04s)]
*  I mean, when you get to, when you just get those playoff reps the way that they did and faced, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1099.6s)]
*  you know, Boston Halliburton went out, but all those other guys, there's a level of confidence. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1105.52s)]
*  There's a swagger. They are not intimidated by the moment. They're not afraid of the moment. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1111.52s)]
*  It's a bitch for Cleveland. I'm so bummed out that they're, they don't have Garland because [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1116.8799999999999s)]
*  they've been so good all season long that they deserve like the full compliment to go ahead and [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1121.84s)]
*  take a legit run at this season and they're not going to get it because Garland's absence is, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1128.0s)]
*  it isn't just like a scoring issue. It's part of what you said, Bill. It is the fact that he's not [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1135.04s)]
*  there to bring the ball up. It impacts so many different perimeter defense, like, you know, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1140.96s)]
*  so many different aspects of what Cleveland wants to do. Plus it's Ty Jerome, who's great, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1146.88s)]
*  when he's the Deion Waiters guy in the movie, but you don't want him on the poster necessarily, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1154.48s)]
*  but you love when he comes in for some like crazy scenes like Tom Sizemore style. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1160.08s)]
*  But I don't know if I'm building the movie around him. Yeah, look, I still think Indy could have [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1165.6s)]
*  beaten them if Cleveland was healthy. I really thought these teams, I thought these teams were [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1171.68s)]
*  pretty even that I thought the Halliburton story in the athletic this week was fascinating about, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1176.8s)]
*  uh, you know, you don't hear a lot of players talk about when they get in a funks. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1182.32s)]
*  And it just like, he did all the stuff like we talked to bring your colleagues about sometimes, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1188.48s)]
*  like don't fucking read that stuff. Don't go on these boards. Don't go on your Twitter replies, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1194.96s)]
*  like ignore all that stuff. Nothing good happens in those corners. Don't read it. Don't read it. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1198.96s)]
*  And Halliburton was like, I was reading everything and I was driving myself crazy [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1206.24s)]
*  from the moment the Olympics happened all the way through. I read everything. I saw every criticism [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1210.8s)]
*  and it got in my head and I started to lose my joy for stuff. And now I cut it out and now I have my [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1216.48s)]
*  mojo back. But how many times can you remember an athlete like that openly talking about that? I was [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1222.8799999999999s)]
*  kind of stunned, especially not a current athlete or a current player. I know Kevin Durant is like [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1227.44s)]
*  famously known for being in his mentions, like reading everything that's written about him in [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1233.68s)]
*  the media and what people are saying on social. But most people try to present a face of like, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1240.32s)]
*  I'm above the fray. And Halliburton coming out and just being like, nah man, like I'm reading all [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1246.56s)]
*  these horrible things that are being said about me and it's bumming me the hell out. And it's [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1252.3999999999999s)]
*  actually was having an impact on my game. That is unique. Most times, like again, like active players [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1257.52s)]
*  don't like to show, you know, present themselves as having flaws or weaknesses or whatever the [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1263.28s)]
*  case may be. And so yeah, I mean, I think it's dope that he talked about it and I think it's even [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1269.44s)]
*  better that he's sending a message that like, you need to block that out. The internet has, you know, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1273.8400000000001s)]
*  many great things about it. You know, in many ways we owe our careers to the internet, but goddamn is [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1280.8s)]
*  it negative and just nasty as hell. And so man, it's just a smart thing for him to do to just lock [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1288.0s)]
*  in with your people and be a great pacer. And look at these guys, they're up two oh, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1295.04s)]
*  you know, against the number one team in the East this season. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1300.48s)]
*  Well, I think one of the things with him, you could see it the first part of the season, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1303.6000000000001s)]
*  I didn't vote for a Perot NBA mostly because of the first two months. I just didn't think he was [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1308.08s)]
*  good enough. And that there was a couple of games where he'd watched them some nights and he didn't [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1312.32s)]
*  have the big impact of what you would expect from a typical NBA guy. But he was on the bubble for me. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1316.88s)]
*  Um, but you watched the playoffs house. If I do my pyramid of guys who are left, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1323.12s)]
*  be good social graphic and Yocage is at the top of the pyramid. Yes. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1328.32s)]
*  The next level down, would you have SGA and Curry? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1335.6799999999998s)]
*  No. Who would you have Brunson, buddy Brunson? Yeah. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1339.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. He's never been in the Eastern finals. So you say we're doing that. We're taking [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1347.92s)]
*  her his four rings. We're tossing in the ocean. What pyramid is this? I thought we were doing the [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1354.48s)]
*  2025 NBA playoff pyramid. Yeah. The guys right now, the guys who are left. So being hurt, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1358.5600000000002s)]
*  you're knocking them down. Yes. Yeah. Brunson's not hurt. Brunson's going into Boston and ripping [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1364.0s)]
*  the heart out of that city. All right. So, all right. So you agree with that? Was you got SGA [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1370.48s)]
*  Brunson on that second level? For sure. I think it sometimes gets to that level. Especially his, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1381.68s)]
*  the Lakers, like he was just controlling and dominating play in that series. But yeah, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1389.52s)]
*  I would say Steph SGA. Okay. So third level. Can I put Curry in the third level or are we dangling [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1394.64s)]
*  him? Because he's third level. Third level. So can I do Curry, Mitchell and Ant in the third level? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1401.2800000000002s)]
*  Where are you going to put Halliburton? That's what I was about to say. Okay. Well, and he's there. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1412.0s)]
*  I hesitate to say this name right now, given the week that's happened, but Jason Tatum, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1417.2s)]
*  the fourth MVP, is he out of the top three levels now? This is the NBA, the 2025 NBA playoffs. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1421.92s)]
*  Show me his signature game in the 2025 NBA playoffs. So you put, you put Halliburton with [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1431.3600000000001s)]
*  Curry and Mitchell in the third level. Question Bill of all of those guys. And there's 12 seconds [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1437.2s)]
*  left on the clock. The Celtics are down one or whoever is down one. Would you trust Tatum [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1445.36s)]
*  over any of the guys that you just previously mentioned? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1452.24s)]
*  Was, it's not a great week for the question. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1456.8799999999999s)]
*  Get them Was. Get them. I talk about it with my dad a lot in the next segment. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1461.9199999999998s)]
*  I got rope adoped a little bit. Hopefully, maybe it's not a rope adobe. Maybe it was just too bad [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1469.1999999999998s)]
*  games, but we watched them for four months. And I really believed. And then you saw what happened [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1473.92s)]
*  in the first two games. And now I don't know what to believe. What do you believe? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1481.04s)]
*  I mean, it's crazy for me because I feel like I was one of the most vocal Tatum's like skeptics [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1486.3200000000002s)]
*  in the media. And I thought I kind of had a turnaround on the guy. Like I thought he got [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1492.88s)]
*  kind of a bad rap. Yes, he didn't make shots in the playoffs last year, but he was incredible on [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1497.68s)]
*  defense. He was their best basically initiator setting up other guys because they don't have a [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1502.56s)]
*  real point guard on the team. Like he was the best rebounder. Like he was the engine of what won that [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1508.6399999999999s)]
*  championship last year, especially against Dallas too. Obviously he couldn't make a shot in the [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1514.72s)]
*  Olympics. But then this year I'm like, look, man, all the stuff we used to complain about, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1520.32s)]
*  his tunnel vision, his refusal to get off the ball sometimes, the bad long contested twos, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1524.72s)]
*  his refusal to get to the free throw line when he has smaller guys on him. He was executing all of [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1531.2s)]
*  that stuff perfectly, clearly playing the best ball of his life. And then game two was literally [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1537.44s)]
*  the encapsulation of everything negative people have ever had to say about Tatum. He embodied it [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1543.3600000000001s)]
*  in that game. And I just, I can't believe that Jason Tatum is actually the player that we saw [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1549.1200000000001s)]
*  in game two. I can't believe that. We're going to take a break, not because we need to [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1554.64s)]
*  throw to a sponsor, but because I personally need a break from talking about Jason Tatum. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1560.8000000000002s)]

*  I would go up on Tatum assist too. Maybe even do that points rebounds plus assist bet with the [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1591.7600000000002s)]

*  of guys who are left and we got a little stuck on, uh, on Jason Tatum or the Boston Celtics, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1721.92s)]
*  given the week that he's having and Joe house did not have a chance to chime in. So I'm going to [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1727.6s)]
*  give you the floor, Joe house. All I want to say out loud is it is possible that whatever happened [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1731.3600000000001s)]
*  to his wrist in that Orlando series that had him miss a game. And, you know, to his credit, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1739.0400000000002s)]
*  he did come back, um, earlier than forecasted. It seemed like a wrist injury that was going to [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1746.5600000000002s)]
*  have him missing multiple games for a team that relies on three points shooting. If there is, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1751.68s)]
*  this would be the best story to come out that the wrist isn't all the way there, that he's not a [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1758.48s)]
*  hundred percent comfortable and that discomfort is also impacting his judgment. I mean, we really [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1763.68s)]
*  have to extend it. So his brain would have to be in his wrist in the same way that Anthony Edwards, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1771.1200000000001s)]
*  you know, um, in these, the first two games, uh, you know, his, his, what the least the first game, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1777.92s)]
*  the lack of, of energy, um, against Golden State. And, and he wasn't great at the beginning of the [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1785.52s)]
*  Lakers series. That's where I was going to go. But for Tatum, if that lack of confidence tied to the [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1791.36s)]
*  risks has him just, you know, settling rather than going inside, he, this is the thing that was just [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1798.3999999999999s)]
*  said. There's no reason he can't go, go be a bully. There's no reason that he can't go down low and [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1803.9199999999998s)]
*  take on OG and an OB and try and get to the free throw line. There's nothing standing in his way [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1810.6399999999999s)]
*  in that respect, but I'm trying to be generous and gracious with Tatum BS. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1815.84s)]
*  It's been really good. And I don't have an explanation for, uh, what happened the last [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1821.6s)]
*  two games, but talk about it later. Well, at least I get my thoughts later. So if we went [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1825.52s)]
*  pyramid of guys right now and the list can move and the list can go up and down, but if we're [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1830.48s)]
*  just saying right now, guys who are playing the best, Yogiage, SGA Brunson, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1836.08s)]
*  Caliburton, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1841.04s)]
*  Aunt Mitchell. Sure. And then Corey with an asterisk cause he's hurt with Tatum, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1845.28s)]
*  Mobley with an asterisk cause he's hurt. Towns? No. Jalen Williams, Brown, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1854.1599999999999s)]
*  Holmgren, Aaron Gordon, Murray. Like it kind of drops off. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1863.84s)]
*  Yeah. I like Aaron Gordon the best out of all those names. You just said Aaron Gordon's the [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1868.24s)]
*  only one. I'm like, Hey, there's a name guy that I think is pretty good. I mean, aside from J-Dub, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1872.24s)]
*  those guys are just asked to sort of be as complimentary as they possibly can. They're [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1878.08s)]
*  not asked to drive any actions. J-Dub at times is like, all right, you're going to have the ball, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1886.6399999999999s)]
*  you're going to create, you're going to be a one-on-one initiating kind of guy. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1892.8000000000002s)]
*  Aaron Gordon's just asked to fill in the blanks around Jokic and Murray and all the things that [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1897.8400000000001s)]
*  those guys are doing. I think Murray, I've been pretty disappointed by his overall playoff so far [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1902.72s)]
*  has been so up and down and inconsistent. And when it looks good, it's like, damn, Denver could win [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1908.72s)]
*  the championship this year. And then when it looks like how it's looked in, you know, so many, too [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1913.52s)]
*  many of these games has been a bit disappointing. Yeah. If you're talking biggest winners for the [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1918.48s)]
*  playoffs so far, even though we're barely in the second round and let's remove the Knicks fan base, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1925.6s)]
*  the Knicks as a team, the Knicks as they were constructed and everybody who put it together, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1931.52s)]
*  Jalen Brunson, just like this has been unbelievable. What's happened with them [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1936.0s)]
*  Caliburn I think is up there. And then Aaron Gordon is the other one. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1940.64s)]
*  Lane, sometimes we'll see this and House and I are older than you was, but sometimes this will [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1945.04s)]
*  happen in the playoffs with these guys who have been around long enough. I remember it happened [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1949.36s)]
*  with Ndegu Dalla in 2015. These guys that were never quite first or second team all NBA, maybe [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1953.6s)]
*  we thought they were going to be slightly better than then a being. And then they figured out [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1959.92s)]
*  how to be this like incredibly impactful. Zach Lowe would call them amplifiers of the awesome [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1963.92s)]
*  player and Gordon now has turned into like, did you think that shot was going in House that three? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1970.56s)]
*  I passed him. You thought it was going in, right? I did. Yes, I did. I did think it was going in. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1976.24s)]
*  Yeah. He's turned into this clutch reliable man. I was so impressed in the games I went to against [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1982.32s)]
*  the Clippers. Like he was just so physical guards the hell out of people. The jump shot, it was the [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1988.72s)]
*  first thing I noted watching Denver coming into the season was he was just taking threes with so [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=1996.08s)]
*  much more confidence, man. Like there was no hesitation. Like, no, this is a shot I should be [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2001.6799999999998s)]
*  taking because I'm going to make it, which just hasn't been the case throughout his career at all. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2006.72s)]
*  In fact, that was like one of the major knocks of him in Orlando. It's like, yeah, this guy can't [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2012.96s)]
*  shoot. You know, they kind of had him in the Palo roll. They were like trying to the same things that [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2016.96s)]
*  Palo's doing. They try to sort of cast Aaron Gordon as the kind of guy that could do that. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2022.96s)]
*  And he so clearly wasn't, you know, he gets traded to Denver and it's almost like he was born to play [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2028.0s)]
*  with Nicola Jokic, the way that marriage and that synergy has worked. He's definitely one of my [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2033.8400000000001s)]
*  favorite guys to watch. All right. So go little mini pyramid, Jokic, SGA Brunson, Halliburton, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2039.2s)]
*  Mitchell, and then Curry, Tatum, Mobley and Gordon for the right now. I'll put him next level. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2046.16s)]
*  But if you'd shown me that a week ago and you're like, look at this pyramid you made on Thursday's [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2055.68s)]
*  podcast on May, whatever. I'd be like, why is Tatum so low and what happened to Curry? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2060.64s)]
*  House, what are you seeing in this Nick Celtics game? Is there, is it's a 1230 game on Saturday. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2068.16s)]
*  Game four is Monday. The Celtics have been better on the road for whatever reason all year, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2074.0s)]
*  must win game for them. It's going to be the hottest Knicks ticket, I think since the 1999 finals. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2079.7599999999998s)]
*  And what do you, what do you expect if I, if I said to you Celtics win in six or seven or the [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2085.52s)]
*  next sweep, which one would you pick? I still would pick the Celtics, but, but man, it wouldn't be [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2091.7599999999998s)]
*  comfortable. I wouldn't bet $1 on it. And the hard thing with trying to anticipate what's going to [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2100.16s)]
*  happen in this series is you need to tell me how many minutes Porzingis is going to play. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2106.48s)]
*  And you need to tell me what version of Jalen Brown I'm going to get because we just haven't [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2112.72s)]
*  seen that physical version of him be able to play, you know, the full 35 to 40 minutes that the [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2119.6s)]
*  Celtics absolutely positively require to be successful in the playoffs. That to me more than [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2125.68s)]
*  anything has been a missing ingredient in these first two games against the Knicks. It's the, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2132.08s)]
*  it's the guy that can go get that tough bucket when it, when we're in crunch time, when we're [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2137.04s)]
*  inside of six minutes, when it's five minutes towards the end of the game and you need somebody [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2141.44s)]
*  to go get a physical bucket that that was Jalen Brown. That's why he was the MVP of the finals [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2145.8399999999997s)]
*  last year. And there's some reason that he's, it's physical that, that he's not capable of it [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2151.92s)]
*  thus far in these playoffs. Yeah. He's somewhere 85 to 90%. I would say was. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2157.6s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, he's shooting 30% from three when, you know, the jumper has been incredible all [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2163.04s)]
*  season long and for you to be shooting 30 in the playoffs, you know, that's, that's Tony Allen [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2168.16s)]
*  territory. If we're being honest there, I just, to me, what I want to see from Tatum and Brown, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2173.76s)]
*  who we know is dealing with a, with a bum knee right now is when Josh Hart or, and Josh Hart's [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2181.52s)]
*  a great defender, you know, he's a gamer or Jalen Brunson, a guard of you guys, you, you have five [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2188.8s)]
*  inches on these dudes, man, in a big situation and a situation where it feels like New York is [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2195.44s)]
*  chipping into your lead and things are snowballing. Like you should be able to take these guys to the [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2201.6800000000003s)]
*  basket and generate a shot at the basket or a kick out or a kick out. Yeah. For some extreme [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2206.48s)]
*  level of help and get New York in rotation and doing your Boston Celtics thing. Like the entire [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2214.0s)]
*  offense is designed in order to create these driving lanes for these guys. And the idea that [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2219.44s)]
*  you have all these shooters around you and some dude that's six, two starts guarding you, you settle [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2228.0s)]
*  for a fade away from 13 feet out. That is just unacceptable to me. And, you know, I just have no [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2234.16s)]
*  reason to believe that that won't change. But I think the problem for Boston is like, yes, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2241.6s)]
*  to me, they've clearly been the better team, but I think New York has an opportunity to play better. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2246.64s)]
*  I don't think they've played their best. Well, that's the alarming thing. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2253.92s)]
*  And yet they're up 2-0 in the series. Yeah, it's alarming. I think they, what was it, they had their worst offensive [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2257.8399999999997s)]
*  rating of the year in game two. Out of all the games they've played, it was either worst or second [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2262.32s)]
*  worst. 85 offensive rating in the half court. That is putrid. It, it, I don't know, House. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2266.96s)]
*  I don't like to see you this way, my friend, but it wasn't great. It's tough to defend a title. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2279.76s)]
*  Let's be, let's be real about it. It's tough to defend a title. The thing you said, House, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2287.52s)]
*  the most alarming piece of this to me is you're like, I don't know what to expect from poor [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2292.16s)]
*  Zingas. What's he going to be like the rest of the series? And I think the answer is he's going to be [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2296.4s)]
*  the guy you saw in game two. I don't think he's healthy. I think there's something wrong with him. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2301.04s)]
*  And I think if it was any other situation, he wouldn't be playing. And that's a guy who's 20 [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2305.28s)]
*  a game for them when he's healthy with rim protection and insurance for the top two guys, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2310.08s)]
*  if either of them are off. And now, now that's gone. You saw what happened to Horford the more [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2316.72s)]
*  minutes he had to play and, you know, teams start getting tight. The, the, why is that the, the [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2321.52s)]
*  piece I don't understand is just the settling and the one-on-one stuff and the lack of movement, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2332.8799999999997s)]
*  which I thought they had corrected for the most part over the course of the year. Whereas like, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2339.8399999999997s)]
*  if something wasn't working, somebody starts moving. One of the guards comes over, they reset [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2344.3199999999997s)]
*  whatever they're doing. And now they're just jacking shit up. The assist totals were way down in [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2349.9199999999996s)]
*  those two games. And that's, it matched what you're watching when you're watching where it's like, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2354.3999999999996s)]
*  just whoever has the ball is going to shoot. My guy, Moe Dock Hill called it hubris. And I agree [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2358.24s)]
*  with him. It's like, OKC came out as if their season was on the line. Like if we lose this game, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2363.7599999999998s)]
*  our season is over. They treated it like a damn near game seven. I can't say that about Boston. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2372.24s)]
*  It's not that they didn't play hard. They're up 20. But like, you're shooting jump shots [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2378.8799999999997s)]
*  in the fourth quarter and you got guys like Carl Linton-y Towns and Jalen Brunson on the court. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2384.64s)]
*  You're not attacking these matchups as if your life, it just feels like they didn't feel like [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2393.8399999999997s)]
*  their life depended on it. Yeah, I agree. Which I think is just crazy. Whereas SGA was the opposite. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2399.04s)]
*  He comes out and he's like, we're not losing tonight. I've got this, guys. Well, here's the thing. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2405.12s)]
*  My dad and I didn't really talk about this, so I feel like this is a relatively flush topic. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2411.04s)]
*  This is a real fork in the road weekend for Jason Tatum, who won the title last year, but then [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2415.7599999999998s)]
*  somehow still didn't get all the spoils and left the summer with as many questions as answers in [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2422.4s)]
*  a lot of ways, which I think was immensely frustrating to him and the team and his coach. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2429.84s)]
*  A lot of what was happening this season was them correcting the narrative that he wasn't one of the [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2434.48s)]
*  best players in the league and he was awesome the last four months. Now we're in this situation where [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2439.76s)]
*  they need him the same way the Nuggets needed Jokic in game four, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2446.1600000000003s)]
*  right? The same way the OKC needed needed SGA last night, the same way the Warriors needed Curry [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2450.48s)]
*  to play a perfect, really smart basketball game in game seven and just make all the right plays [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2458.0s)]
*  for four quarters. That's what's alarming to me, House is he wasn't making the right plays. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2463.6s)]
*  He wasn't dissecting the Knicks in the way that he was doing all season and even in the Orlando [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2469.3599999999997s)]
*  Series. See, I agree with all of that and I hate to take the conversation in this direction, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2476.56s)]
*  but the fork in the road moment is for the Celtics. It's not just Tatum. I mean, if they lose, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2483.52s)]
*  you go and stack a third apron on me. I mean, I didn't put you on that apron. The ownership did it [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2490.64s)]
*  and it was the right thing to do. Let's go see if we can defend the title where, well, as we sit here [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2499.7599999999998s)]
*  today, it doesn't feel great. The idea of defending the title doesn't seem likely and it looks like [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2506.08s)]
*  the team can't afford to keep both Jalen Brown and Jason Tatum. And so it's or or holiday or [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2513.2799999999997s)]
*  poor Zingas like it. It's clear that there's it's this is the short window of this is basically a [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2520.08s)]
*  two year run with the group they had last year and this year. And then one of those guys just [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2527.36s)]
*  financially, I don't feel confident. I don't know which one it'll be long term. They still have a [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2531.36s)]
*  longer window built around Tatum and Brown that they're in the middle of and they've been in the [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2537.36s)]
*  middle of all decade. But I think this was their best chance other than last year with the contracts [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2541.04s)]
*  with the players on the team and the quality of the players with the state of the league. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2548.48s)]
*  They're never going to be in a better spot than this. Right, House? That's certainly my view. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2552.8s)]
*  I had them in ink in the NBA finals against Oklahoma City. First warning. Jesus, I wish I [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2557.76s)]
*  had that. You have that. You had the same thing. You had them against Oklahoma City. That's that's [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2565.0400000000004s)]
*  the bet we made when the season started. That was our finals matchup. Somebody's got to dig up the [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2570.6400000000003s)]
*  footage of Tatum's last game at Madison Square Garden. It was the last Knicks and Celtics matchup [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2575.5200000000004s)]
*  of the season. I get it. It's regular season. But I know for a fact that Knicks desperately wanted [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2583.68s)]
*  to win that game because they had gotten their butts kicked all season long. The crowd in the [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2588.64s)]
*  garden was losing their minds, desperately wanted to win that. Tatum was sublime, dude. That move [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2594.3999999999996s)]
*  that he put on OGN and OB to get the game winning shot was incredible. I was like, this guy is at [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2602.64s)]
*  the peak of his powers. I've never seen Tatum be this incredible. OGN and OB has traditionally [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2610.0s)]
*  been a bugger boo for him. He's obviously one of the best isolation defenders in the league. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2615.76s)]
*  I don't expect you to go out and just make OGN and OB look like a scrub. I'm not saying that. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2620.8s)]
*  But he just has to be more methodical. He has to be smarter about how he attacks this Knick defense [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2626.4s)]
*  because I do think there are other places to attack. You always want to do the stuff that [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2634.0s)]
*  the defense is overreacting to. They attacked Brunson at the beginning of the game with Drew [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2642.0s)]
*  Holliday and then the Knicks switched on that. I've always noticed when they put Tatum at the foul [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2646.88s)]
*  line in that Nowitzki spot, teams hate that when they have the right spacing around him. He's [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2651.28s)]
*  really good at turning around and shooting over somebody, going to the basket, doing a little [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2657.36s)]
*  fall away or finding a shooter if people are drifting off. That's become something that's been [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2662.4s)]
*  a really good piece of his game. Actually, Jalen Brown is pretty good at it too. They weren't [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2668.64s)]
*  really doing that at all in the second half. Even I look at that last play where they do the full [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2672.96s)]
*  court all the way down score. Brunson comes back, Jukes, Drew gets fouled. Then the Celtics run the [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2678.4s)]
*  exact same play again and it's the worst play in the history of the franchise. Fucking abomination. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2683.52s)]
*  Like I've never seen worse spacing. There's never been worse spacing on a play ever. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2688.88s)]
*  Five guys all next to each other. But I would have called timeout and done that lob to Tatum at the [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2693.28s)]
*  top of the key foul line area and just created that space. That's the stuff. I want to see them [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2701.04s)]
*  start playing chess again, House, because it was checkers in those first two games. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2707.04s)]
*  I totally agree. And that's the place where poor Zingas is so crucial because if you put Tatum... [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2710.64s)]
*  Stop fucking mentioning him. Jesus Christ. If poor Zingas plays 15 minutes, it's a miracle. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2717.04s)]
*  But he can crash. He's the guy that gets the ball as Tatum starts his move and the defense [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2722.4s)]
*  collapses in. Poor Zingas is standing right there to knock down that three and he's [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2728.08s)]
*  so reliable at that. Okay, I'll stop. I'm sorry. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2732.16s)]
*  No, I know. I feel like 15 minutes of him playing decently is what I'm looking at. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2734.24s)]
*  And I think the Joe Maz piece has to matter here too. I get it. We do what we do. The math is the [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2741.2s)]
*  math. We're going to shoot 63s no matter what the situation is. Just context doesn't matter. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2748.7999999999997s)]
*  We get a three. We're going to shoot it. I get that. But there needs to be some level of adjustment [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2757.52s)]
*  to the realities on the ground. Attack Carl Anthony Towns. He's right there. Just go at him. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2762.7999999999997s)]
*  Everybody wants to foul. He's dying to foul somebody. Let him foul. Let Kat foul. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2769.84s)]
*  And guess who else likes to foul on people? Mitchell Robinson. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2775.92s)]
*  That was great. That's another thing. And I mentioned this on group chat. The whole [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2779.6800000000003s)]
*  we got to get Mitchell Robinson off the floor as if he's Hakeem Olajuwon or Shaq. That is [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2784.56s)]
*  great. That was just crazy to me. And Joe Maz in the press conference was like, yeah, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2790.6400000000003s)]
*  God was plus 22. He was killing us. Yeah. I wanted him off the floor. It's like, bro, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2795.68s)]
*  nobody thought Mitchell Robinson was killing us. Not one person who watched that game was like, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2799.68s)]
*  oh my God, we can't stop Mitchell Robinson. House. Is this the biggest next game [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2804.48s)]
*  since that you could remember since you were in law 1999? You're at a loss at that point. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2810.72s)]
*  Easily that way. The Vince Carter Toronto series, because they had that next Pacers series in 2013, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2817.2799999999997s)]
*  but that was no, it's kind of a better this team is better. And this team is, you know, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2824.8s)]
*  the it's the culmination of all of these moves that, you know, the front office, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2831.84s)]
*  the reinvigorated front office that by in turn reinvigorated the fan base and created, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2837.04s)]
*  you know, this excitement that that's been unmatched since when was Linsanity. I don't know. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2843.44s)]
*  What's the last time? Definitely. That's the last time. Like insanity. That was crazy. Nick [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2848.8s)]
*  excitement. But in terms of like after a Nick playoff victory, like I'm telling you, [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2854.56s)]
*  the last time this felt like this was the LJ four point play. That was the last time, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2860.16s)]
*  like coming off of a Nick's victory was like, oh my God, I can't believe this is happening. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2867.04s)]
*  And for that sent them into the finals. Whereas this is just like, you know, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2872.16s)]
*  giving them a two game advantage over the world champs. But it's, you know, it's hard to [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2877.2799999999997s)]
*  underestimate. Bill said it's going to be the craziest ticket at MSG in years. And that's true. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2881.36s)]
*  Like it's they're going to be ready to blow the roof off. Like not even a 330 local time is going [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2885.76s)]
*  to stop it. Like it doesn't matter. These people are going to be rabid. I think that Monday game is [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2891.6800000000003s)]
*  going to be even crazier. Yeah. Monday nighter. So my dad, who's not, he hasn't even been on the [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2897.6800000000003s)]
*  podcast yet. He's really hoping for Scott Foster game three. We'll see. The cooler. Yeah. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2904.8s)]
*  Fingers crossed for the extender. He was an OKC last night. How's this watching what happened [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2911.6s)]
*  with the Knicks give you confidence with, uh, with your team, the about the capital, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2921.6s)]
*  well, you got the lottery on Monday night. Yeah. Look, I went on, uh, the Ringer NBA draft show [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2930.8s)]
*  with J Kyle Mann, and I couldn't believe the words that were coming out of my mouth. There [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2938.88s)]
*  was a lot of enthusiasm for the direction of this young Washington team. And if we just get a little [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2943.36s)]
*  bit of luck, honestly, I said this to, to JKM, if Washington gets any of the first four picks, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2949.44s)]
*  I think there are great players at each of those picks in Washington's developmental mode that, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2955.84s)]
*  that they're in right now. And the head coach Brian Keefe, like, you know, any one of those [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2960.7200000000003s)]
*  four guys can flourish. Now, of course I want Cooper. I mean, we did poop for coop all season [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2965.36s)]
*  long. So, you know, it'd be nice to, to be, uh, rewarded for that. But, um, I, I, I'm very excited [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2969.92s)]
*  for this, this, the direction of the Washington franchise. It's, it's just amazing that both the [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2977.44s)]
*  football team and the basketball team for the first time in what feels like 30 years, I shouldn't say [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2982.1600000000003s)]
*  feels like in the, for the first time in 30 years has a direction and a plan. I it's just unbelievable. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2987.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, hopefully you'll get one of the Rutgers guys. Cause I think that team went 12 and 20 last year [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=2995.44s)]
*  putting those guys in winning legacy of that one. And I T game they won. Um, I, I'm very excited for [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3001.2000000000003s)]
*  the, for the lottery before we go. Okay. See Denver really quick. Do you see anything in those [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3009.44s)]
*  first two games was that makes you think, okay, see, is that one in the series? [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3014.7200000000003s)]
*  Not really. Um, but I think what people should be looking for is the tightness of the whistle. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3017.92s)]
*  Um, if the refs allow okay. See, to be physical, meaning allow them to file Denver, [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3026.64s)]
*  they're going to have no, but they're going to be able to guard them quite competently. Like we saw [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3033.44s)]
*  last night, if any of these crews are just like actually calling files, that's when they're going [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3039.28s)]
*  to run into some issues. Um, so that's what I'm really going to be watching for because they can't [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3045.68s)]
*  physically, none of their big men can physically match up with your kids, not chat, not Jalen [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3051.2s)]
*  Williams. Um, not even heart and steam, but you know, if they're allowed to sort of coming up and [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3056.8799999999997s)]
*  hold and, you know, keep their hands on guys coming off the screens, like if they're allowed [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3064.3199999999997s)]
*  to play as physical as they typically do, then they got a great shot at defending Denver and [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3069.3599999999997s)]
*  well on their way to the conference finals. How's Jokic all time for you? [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3074.56s)]
*  Oh, are you kidding me? Oh God. I mean, he's in the conference. He's in the top 10. So, [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3080.32s)]
*  uh, Tim Duncan, I don't, you know who, what he's doing this playoffs. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3087.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you tell me, would you have it above anything you ever saw from Kobe? [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3094.96s)]
*  He's, he's in the top 10. He's, he's, he's probably trying to start trouble. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3099.84s)]
*  No, cause I left, I, I said on the pod, I left that Clipper game and that was the best game I've [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3106.7200000000003s)]
*  seen anyone play in person since Michael Jordan, maybe LeBron in the 2012, that, that crazy game [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3112.08s)]
*  he had in game six in Boston, but that it was like at that level where it was like, holy shit, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3118.1600000000003s)]
*  this is insane that somebody is this good at basketball. So it's, for me, it was in that area, [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3124.0s)]
*  which is, you know, houses known me a long time. I don't throw that around. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3130.08s)]
*  For me, Jokic offensively, I know he has his defensive limitations and that matters [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3133.92s)]
*  is as good as prime staff, prime LeBron in terms of his impact on the court. Uh, like again, like [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3140.32s)]
*  I love Jamal Murray. The guy is very inconsistent. Um, it's Stefan LeBron level elevating [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3148.72s)]
*  every single thing that's next to them, you know, in those two guys, his primes. And so, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3156.9599999999996s)]
*  yeah, Jokic, man, I got too much love and respect for what he does out there. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3163.2799999999997s)]
*  I was on Terminator show yesterday and this was when they hadn't lost to OKC yet. So they're up [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3167.3599999999997s)]
*  one, nothing. I said, he somehow put this together and won four straight rounds [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3172.08s)]
*  and went through that Quippers team in round one, the 68 win. Okay. See team in round two [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3178.56s)]
*  gets his revenge, gets his revenge against Minnesota. Who's been his boy for two years [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3185.2799999999997s)]
*  and then takes out pick an East team. And that's the gauntlet. That's like the best runs we've had [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3191.12s)]
*  the last 30 years are probably the Dirk 2011 run when it was like Durant and, uh, and Kobe, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3197.44s)]
*  and then, you know, LeBron and Wade in the finals and there's somebody else good too. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3204.64s)]
*  And then that Hakeem run, the famous Hakeem run when he beat every great center in the league, [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3209.04s)]
*  including Robinson, who won the MVP. I don't think it's going to happen because I think [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3213.84s)]
*  OKC is so good, but if, if it did happen, I think it would immediately go in that [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3218.7200000000003s)]
*  short list. Right house. That's that's like, that would be the territory. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3223.6s)]
*  And, and it puts him like, you know, it cements him inside the top eight of all time players. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3227.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. It, it elevates him another level. I thought just even getting through that Quipper series was [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3235.36s)]
*  shocking to me. Was any, any farewell words for James Harden that you didn't use on the group chat [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3242.6400000000003s)]
*  on the iPad? Look, man, James Harden, the only thing I'll say James Harden is 35 now. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3247.52s)]
*  He like the time that he played well in that series were way beyond anything that I could [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3255.84s)]
*  have reasonably expected. I thought it was going to be a face plant for the entire time. He had [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3262.4s)]
*  moments where he legit looked really freaking good. Yeah. But my God, dude, like that's really [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3267.44s)]
*  going on your resume. The amount of times in the closing games of playoff series when your team [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3274.56s)]
*  absolutely needed you for you to just come up, you know, look, just becoming a pumpkin stuff. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3281.7599999999998s)]
*  It's tough for James Harden. House. You didn't get to give your James Harden thoughts on my podcast. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3288.56s)]
*  I know you have them. I actually don't really blame James Harden as much like he, he is who he is. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3293.7599999999998s)]
*  We keep seeing this version of him at this stage of his career. I don't think it's really fair to [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3301.04s)]
*  like, you know, it's a combination of, you know, the, the alchemy that the Clippers tried to pull [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3307.2s)]
*  off with Kawhi Leonard at this stage of his career, like not really physically capable of a seven game [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3314.24s)]
*  series, not capable of, he showed us his tremendous highs, his capacity for tremendous size. And the [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3320.4s)]
*  same is true of Harden. And then we got to game seven and neither one of them had the, I don't know, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3326.72s)]
*  the athletic verve. I don't know what, what to describe it. They didn't have the gasoline. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3332.9599999999996s)]
*  That's exactly right. But, you know, how about your guy Westbrook? Love that man. So much never did. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3338.48s)]
*  Look, go back and find that clip from October. You sent it every year. You love Westbrook. Well, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3346.56s)]
*  I said, you know, it could be the jokers greatest accomplishment, the greatest feat of his career, [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3352.56s)]
*  which is resuscitating the career of Russell Westbrook. Lo and behold, Russell Westbrook is [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3359.84s)]
*  extremely important to this Denver team and their future success. It's been a joy to watch these [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3364.08s)]
*  playoffs. I'm not, I'm, I'm, I'm a full Westbrook stand. Well, I hope we're talking about Jason [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3369.36s)]
*  Tatum favorably in eight to nine years. We'll see what happens this weekend. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3377.76s)]
*  Can I make a plea on behalf of NBA America? Can we please now look, I like Wingstop. I'm a fan. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3383.44s)]
*  Can we please no more Jalen Green, Jalen Green Wingstop commercials. They got to cut another spot. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3393.92s)]
*  Go find a different guy. Nobody knows who he is. And he's out of the, you don't want to tell your [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3401.6000000000004s)]
*  customers the subliminal message that Wingstop is sending people is that you're going to have a good [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3408.88s)]
*  meal here once out of every six occasions. That's when you put Jalen Green is the face of your brand. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3413.44s)]
*  You're saying one out of every six times, one out of every six of these tenders is going to be [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3420.0800000000004s)]
*  perfect for you. That's not the best bench waiting to get your wings and they're never going to come. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3425.04s)]
*  And then every six times they will. So do you think they should cut as the moment the guy gets [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3431.44s)]
*  bounced from the commercial, from the playoffs? We never see him in another commercial. Absolutely. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3435.84s)]
*  You hear that, Waz? Yeah, absolutely. And I, and I get it. And you know what? Restart your campaign [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3439.76s)]
*  when the playoffs are over. I don't know. Like I just can't, that they just show the same commercial [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3445.52s)]
*  and I'm over the OKC commercial too. I know Jacoby did a big rant about that. Yeah, Jacoby did a whole thing. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3452.32s)]
*  That was cradded. That was awkward. It's very cringe. The thing with house is the food commercials [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3457.12s)]
*  really hit home for house because he gets hungry every time. Well, every time I feel like. So if it's a Wingstop, [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3463.2799999999997s)]
*  house immediately gets excited for wings. But then there's Jalen Green and now he's not excited. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3468.4s)]
*  Every time it starts, I feel like it's possible. There's a 2% chance it has a different outcome. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3473.7599999999998s)]
*  No, it's Jalen Green sitting in that car on his way to the, to Cancun or Galveston where he, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3478.72s)]
*  where Houston really belongs after that future performance. He's going to be on his way to Milwaukee. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3485.92s)]
*  He really is. That's where that car is headed. Great points. Or Phoenix. Good luck. House, do you feel [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3491.36s)]
*  vindicated that all the Suns fans revile Bradley Beal? No, and Bradley Beal didn't do anything wrong. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3497.6800000000003s)]

*  that dopey Ted Leones has signed off on. And he's just trying to live his best Bradley Beal life. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3512.64s)]
*  He doesn't really want to play basketball. He doesn't. He likes playing basketball. He's like, [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3518.48s)]
*  he likes the money. He likes the life. He likes. Two more years of the contract. When we're doing [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3524.48s)]
*  worse contracts in March. I'm already excited for whatever Brooklyn has in store for us this summer. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3529.52s)]
*  There might be a very fun Ty Jerome overpay that we might, that might be able to make the list. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3536.16s)]
*  Embiid, I would guess, would be the number one guy on the list when we do this. I mean, it's still [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3542.56s)]
*  10 months away, but worse contracts. One of the most fun days of the year. All right. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3547.92s)]
*  We're going to take a break and come back with my dad talking Seltzniks. Was great to see you as [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3553.2s)]

*  I do have a new computer. It takes the amount of time it takes to get the new passwords, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3567.84s)]
*  put your passwords into every single. The porn passwords or the word passwords? [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3574.56s)]
*  No, no. So for every like app, every single site that you go to requires double authentication. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3580.08s)]
*  It's a double-edited dildo trying to sit there and figure out how to get it. So I'm doing it like, [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3587.1200000000003s)]

*  Double authentication. Come on, man. That's a damn jail and green Wingstop commercial. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3599.6s)]
*  Double-edged dildo and 10% chunks. Good one to end it on as we head to our talking about [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R79xfNTSyHE&t=3604.9599999999996s)]
