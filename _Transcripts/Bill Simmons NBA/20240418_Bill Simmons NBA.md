# 76ers-Knicks Playoff Preview | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCWrUrqCMEI)
*  All right, I've known Chris Ryan since 2011. I've known Sean fantasy since 2012 when we all started working together. It's been 12 years
*  Nary a sixers nicks
*  Playoff series
*  We're both guys kind of like their teams
*  Nary a nicks sixers playoff series anyway
*  and
*  Nary a nicks team that Sean fantasy even liked and Sean fantasy loves this team and now we have a two versus seven
*  sixers nicks
*  That though right now looking at fandel the odds are dead even both teams are minus 110 vegas says this is a dead even series
*  Um, can we just I want to what's the relationship like these days?
*  I just want to find out where do things stand with you? Is this going to get ugly? What's going to happen bill?
*  You know, I know you don't really do a ton of baseball talk anymore, but I can feel this is kind of like your
*  Your shadow jacko kind of like you're setting us up. Okay. Can I do it? Yeah
*  Oh
*  shawnee
*  Do you want to do the van pelde intro for my intro I know you have to ask bill
*  Um, no, seriously, uh, I think Sean and I are good man
*  I mean, i'm just so happy not to be playing any more games against the miami heat
*  Yeah, and i'm ecstatic not to be in the boston side of the bracket. So
*  A little bit of a spring vacation for me
*  Fantasy you get your you missed the boston side of the bracket
*  Yanis is still hurt. We have no idea when he's coming back
*  And you get to play filly with imbede who's just been limping around for the past couple weeks and nobody has any idea if he's healthy
*  We were seconds away though from
*  The heat without jimmy butler which would have been that would have been a little tasty
*  You say that you say that but just let me tell you don't want it
*  Without jimmy though without you, I mean I don't really
*  I don't really want to deal with joe lm beat even if he's only at 60
*  I don't want to deal with him now. I know he was a he was a mummy through three quarters
*  Of that heat game, but I just I you know
*  He legitimately is one of the five best players in the nba. That's not who you want to see
*  In a playoff game. You just don't want to deal with a player like that that being said
*  I think mitchell robinson is going to be kicking him in the shins non-stop for seven straight games mitchell robinson
*  Chris can you walk us through year eight of I wonder what we're gonna get out of joe lm bead
*  This is different this year
*  Because you know, I think he would have repeated his mvp if he hadn't gotten hurt
*  I really like this team this team arguably would have been where shawn's team is now
*  In the second seed if he had stayed healthy
*  I don't think that he was
*  Padding stats or packing on extra minutes to win an mvp
*  Which I do think in the past he has been perhaps guilty of and the team has been guilty of letting him do that
*  It was actually like a pretty
*  Stress-free season for me, honestly
*  and then the last
*  batch of it
*  Uh with the sort of weird tobias
*  Swandive that happened in in beads absence
*  Really just kind of made it a bit of a headache until inb came back and it's sixers one eight out of their last 10
*  uh, and look awesome, so
*  Yeah, he tweaked his knee again at the end of the very regular season and had a lot of the sort of um
*  Grabbing at it last night looking a little bit mopey looking a little bit out of it
*  But he still went nuclear in this in the towards the end of the game and won that game for them
*  He's just even some of the plays he was making like the past at ubre and stuff. It was just
*  Fantastic to see him and I just just get me the hell away from that miami zone. Jesus christ
*  Yeah, I was so I really wanted to play miami
*  You felt like boston wants to play miami
*  It wasn't even like I want to because I think they would have beaten philly or miami, but I was like, you know
*  What we're better than this miami team
*  Let's take them down. Let's like let's like really cut the head off like end of h2o halloween style like really let's
*  Let's actually murder this beast once and for all and take these guys out and sweep them and send them fucking packing
*  and then
*  I couldn't even get
*  Enjoy it for two minutes like I was gonna root for miami and the play in like let's bring it on
*  I want to play these guys and then there's butler limping off
*  and
*  You know now now it's this weird thing where it's like hey
*  More from the chicago p playthrough at mcl tear. I mean you're gonna get chicago without caruso
*  I think no, but the internet video came out like I don't know half hour after where it was like
*  Here's jimmy butler leaving the stadium. Okay, and it was clear. He was really hurt
*  Um chimes came in I think it was just like the miami thing is is just like
*  Spolstra is a warlock and and even last night when they were when they went zone after bam got in foul trouble
*  I was just like I can't believe that this seems like this was not discussed in philadelphia
*  Like a little four or five days that they've had no idea. This is coming
*  It wasn't like kyle. Can you come in and just do a quick zoom seminar on what miami does with the zone?
*  It's like they're just gonna dribble right into two guys and nobody's gonna be able to throw a pass to impede
*  So just having that be over with i'm so excited to play the nicks because
*  It's just a fresh a fresh page for the sixers. It's not the same
*  Villain every time it looked like a classic garbage miami win where like hero was gonna take 30 shots. Nobody else really played well
*  Yeah, they're all the sixers in the first half. Yeah butler's having a bad game, but then uh,
*  You know you got nick baton
*  Fantasy have
*  How do you work up the proper amount of hatred for kyle?
*  Lowry like is it just you go to the fridge and grab it or do you are there some?
*  Calisthenics you're gonna do like what play this out?
*  I think in a trip brunson in the first hour of game one, but you gotta remember
*  You know, he's a child of philadelphia and and the nova nicks are children of philadelphia, too
*  So i'm expecting him to come out and just rip off his sixers jersey and reveal a nicks jersey underneath
*  You know just like we're taking over the city of philly. We're gonna there's gonna be
*  Is it gonna be 30 50 nicks fans at those philly games? I mean you stupid
*  We got the josh heart boys. We got the diva. Chenzo boys. We got the brunson boys. They're all coming out
*  So i'm not right. I'm wearing 50 nicks fans in philadelphia
*  You need to show out. I need my nicks brothers to stand up and show up in the city of shitty love
*  And just show out. I was trying to be diplomatic to you. What's your problem?
*  Now
*  Now i hope kyle. Auri quote unquote falls right onto jalen brunson's knee
*  Now he's gonna do the thing where he takes the charge but pulls jalen brunson with him and jalen brunson like slams his elbow
*  Yeah, that's happening in the first hour of the game
*  Well shawn the athlete you hated the most in your entire life was chase utley. Yes, who I believe played for our philadelphia team
*  Yeah, he's a war criminal and he was tried at the haig and he was killed for his crimes publicly
*  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry
*  Yeah, put him on the list. Yeah, put him on the list
*  Let's send him send him to flushing queens. See what happens to kyle. Auri if he puts one finger on jalen brunson
*  He will be buried under the earth forever if he touches not dirty. He just plays hard. He's just he's just physical
*  Uh, that's going to be one really fun
*  Storyline is kyle. Auri doing things
*  Actually thought he looked pretty frisky down the stretch like he's he's not washed up like he's definitely old but he's not washed up
*  I was listening to risolo on the way back
*  Home today though, and he was just like I I feel like I should be paid to watch kyle. Auri
*  But he's not like ineffective and then the the other piece that's going to be so hilarious from a nix fans standpoint
*  Is just the thousand bead gets
*  With the noises the msg crowd is going to make shawn when and bead is lurching into people and just isaiah
*  hartenstein all of a sudden has three fouls in the first half of these games and
*  They're replaying it and the crowd's going nuts on the jimbo chan. I can't wait for that
*  You know if I was the the sixers head coach
*  I would probably be encouraging them to try to get og in into foul trouble because I think og is going to probably
*  Guard and be a solid amount of time. Yeah, that's no problem. We'll do that
*  I mean that I mean the rest of his way
*  Can you get two straight weeks out of og would be the other question? Yeah
*  I mean if they do I think I think the nix will be good
*  I think you guys do in all sincerity
*  Do you do you feel like you're gonna miss randall in this series and miss like having a little bit more offense?
*  I mean no doubt about it
*  Of course like he is hugely important to the offensive makeup of the team
*  But the one time this year when the nix and the sixers played each other at full strength
*  Randall played in that game, but he went one for 11 of the field and the nix still won by 38
*  so
*  The nix at full strength
*  Are really really good
*  But also randall has been the hardest thing to watch in the playoffs for the nix the last two out of the last three seasons
*  So i'm wondering if him being off the floor
*  Just continues to open it up for dudes, you know if dante and and og just are more comfortable
*  Not having to defer to randall offensively
*  I don't like losing 24 and 10 every night, but I do like watching the nix more without randall
*  I don't know if their ceiling is this high but um
*  There's something about the style they have post randall that
*  Resonates with me and I think it's going to work in the playoffs because they play so fucking hard
*  and they get so many like garbage rebound baskets and
*  just hustle plays and they're just relentless and it's
*  to me like
*  There's a little oh four pistons in there with these guys
*  I don't think they're as talented and I think the league is way better than it was in oh four
*  but there's some sort of like toughness and identity and um, they they always seem to at least have one guy going late offensively
*  And they're physical and they keep coming
*  and it's chris it's not not doesn't seem like the ideal opponent for
*  I'm not totally healthy joelle and bead
*  That that if you're giving me that caveat and you're we're saying and bead has got some kind of
*  Of knock or he's still nursing the meniscus and it's not quite right
*  I I I hear you if this is like a flat track and embid is close to or at like 85 to 90 percent
*  I don't really I think the sixers are better than the nix respectfully. What makes you think there that he's 85 percent
*  I don't I mean
*  I just i'm just basing this off of honestly like how much better the team works when he is on the floor
*  Regardless of his health because like even last night aside with like the junk ball that we had to deal with
*  He makes all the other players around him make sense just by his presence and regardless of whether or not he's out there on one leg
*  and crutches
*  hartenstein or or
*  Ogi or whoever it's going to be he's going to be the focal point and it's going to free up maxi and it's going to free
*  Up some other guys and granted like can't count on any single person anymore on the sixers where it's like
*  Sometimes you might get a good nick petoon game sometimes buddy might hit the broad side of a barn
*  But like I think that the sixers actually have some depth coming into this postseason, which we typically have not had
*  so I I actually
*  Honestly, i'm gonna regret this but i'm feeling pretty bullish on this on this series
*  Like I think the nicks are a year away from being there
*  Wow, shawn hearing that a confident cr isn't something i'm not confident, but i've just now that's not a confident
*  I've been in the war i've we've been in the trenches with these like the sixers have gotten their asses kicked in the playoffs
*  They've come up short in the playoffs like they have a lot of playoff experience brunson has like a couple years like
*  I just think that the sixers are going to be pretty savvy in this series
*  This is the same spot the nicks were in last year in the first round
*  Going up against the calves team that people thought were more talented
*  It's different people thought were better that calves team is like young that calves team like mobile all those guys were inexperienced like
*  This is this is a different beast
*  You don't know about donovan mitchell, you know who had success in the playoffs french poetry coming out of nick petoom
*  When he's i'm not worried about nick petoom over seven games nick petoom and kyle laury
*  Playing a combined 45 minutes a game. I'm not that really worried about that
*  I chris and I have done this before but never with basketball last fall chris and our our pal zack barron came over to watch
*  A a jet's eagles game and i'll just say that was probably my you guys targeted targeted jalen hurts
*  We did we did target jalen hurts and we we wounded him and we we took him down like the sad bird that he is
*  And uh, you guys lost to zack wilson. So just be careful how confident you are
*  I forgot you lost to zack wilson. That was the beginning of the end. Yeah
*  That was horrible, um
*  Who do you hate on the nicks chris me have you worked up animosity against anyone yet?
*  Um, I really like the villanova guys, but I will learn to hate josh hart. Yeah. Oh, yeah
*  I like I was temple so I like there's a little bit of big five like I like the villanova guys
*  I'm not like they're not like my my my guys my guys
*  um, but
*  Like I know that josh hart will die for a loose ball
*  And and like knock maxi into the third row in the process and it's gonna it's gonna be a problem
*  Did you like what you saw from maxi last night because I did not I did not and I thought he would have been the key
*  To breaking that zone like he should have just been he should have just been diving at the rim
*  And and it's some he seemed to freeze up a little bit
*  I was so confused by the most improved player thing for him
*  I know russell and I talked about it on sunday, but I just didn't understand the candidacy
*  Maybe I don't understand the award but I thought he was good last year
*  And it just seems like he had more shots this year
*  But did you feel like he was like considerably better than he was last year because I think he was really awesome with
*  Embiid and then I think that he had some some struggles without embiid where it was like he was being forced to to take up
*  He's had way more usage
*  Um, isn't the point to be considerably better than the year before I wouldn't say that was the case
*  Uh, I mean I most like nobody puts the most improved banner up in in in their arena. Like I don't really care
*  What was that 14 they're really good 14 most improved podcast 2018 the big that's true really proud of that
*  You got more shots though, so we don't know
*  Oh
*  so
*  I just want both of you to know
*  I have already wagered on this series. Oh great
*  You bet so we're gonna find out who's gonna win and it's gonna be not who you wagered on it's
*  I think the bet I like the most in round one
*  Out of all the eight series
*  And it's the new york nicks. Yeah, I knew that I could feel it. Oh my god. Oh my god
*  I think the nicks are legit good. I'm a believer. I think they're a good team. I really like
*  I honestly wouldn't have it any other way. I wouldn't have it any other way than you just yet again
*  You're not believing in me and us
*  Me and us
*  cr I took like literally every eagle on my fantasy team last year and picked them I think to win the super bowl or come
*  Close like this is not an anti-philly thing. I really like the nicks closing five. I think they know
*  Who their five is and I think those guys play really well together when og is back
*  All the stuff i've seen when og played with heart defecenzo and brunson and and hartenstein like those guys play great together
*  And i'm worried about them with the celtics. I don't know if og is gonna stay healthy
*  But I like that five against whatever five the sixers are going to have like kelly ubre
*  Um to bias the sixers have even maxi a little bit the sixers have guys
*  I don't know if I totally trust if it's in new york
*  Those five nicks guys are flying around the crowd's going to be out of their minds
*  And I don't I just don't know how many of the sixers I completely trust i've seen nick platoon's act for 15 years
*  Like nick platoon will just disappear
*  He's done it over and over again in the playoffs. He he's like exit stage, right?
*  And he's been really good this year, but I don't trust him
*  I think the idea is that on any given night somebody's got it and the sixers now have more cards to play than just like
*  Oh nick platoon didn't make a shot tonight. So I guess we're screwed and we lose by 18. It's like theoretically
*  Somebody among buddy nick ubre to bias one of those wings should have it going
*  And if that's happening then that's a little bit of an uptick
*  I also just think that we're like giving the nicks an enormous like
*  Pat on the back for a great regular season when it's just like I haven't seen deuce mcbride in the playoffs
*  I haven't like dante di vincenzo. I guess with the warriors, but like I haven't seen like good last year
*  Sure. Yeah heart and di vincenzo are both good players, but I haven't I wouldn't say that they swing playoff series with any regularity
*  Jalen's the guy that you you gotta stop. I mean og when's the last time og like
*  Contributed to a playoff series victory. They're just as unproven as any of the guys
*  Beat the 76ers title in the 2019 when kawaii lennard went one of the champions one championship
*  Okay, I can think of a couple other guys who were more important than him that year only a couple though
*  You know one of which is on your team right now
*  Chris here's the case for you
*  And and bead kills the nicks and it beads healthier than people realize and he's the best part in the series
*  And he just whoops the nicks
*  Anytime you can rope it open a single elimination game. You got to do it, right?
*  You got to just try to hold. Yeah, he was so saying it
*  Yeah, it was a willis reed homage
*  I think
*  The tricky thing about this series what makes it so fun is that they're so evenly matched like the nicks won six of the last
*  Seven the six sixers won eight of their last ten. They both have dealt with injuries a lot
*  They both have nights where random guys just get crazy hot and you're like how did diva chenzo go for 32 tonight?
*  I never expected that this season
*  So they're they're they're tight. They're they're very similar teams and um, we have no history
*  I mean, it's 35 36 years since they faced off in the playoffs. That's crazy for teams that are in the same division
*  You guys are in the same division and there's teams in the east every year
*  It's like impossible that they haven't played and we I don't even understand it
*  The sixers are always drawn against like it feels like we always have like a first round matchup against boston
*  I'm, sorry brooklyn are the wizards then there's like the hawks series
*  There's a raptor series like but I just we've been we've been missing the nicks for for most of my adult life
*  Yeah, it's been an embarrassing franchise
*  Yeah, yeah
*  The nicks don't make the the fact one of the things I looked it up one of the things that really hurt was that the nicks
*  Never made the playoffs
*  So that that turned out that was yeah that was the key really
*  But now i'm getting lectured on like how the nicks are going to handle the playoffs is like welcome to the party
*  Nova guys have a title together like this. They're no stranger to the big stage things transfer down
*  They've they played in front of 80 000 people. Um, there's another element to the series that I think is kind of fun where
*  Indeed like wes and leon are his guys
*  like those literally were his guys before leon took the job and
*  It was anytime anything started to go south with the beat it was always like he's going to the next those guys are gonna get
*  Them and now they're going head to head against him
*  Then you have the villanova
*  With the villanova guys, but they're on the next you have kyle. Lowry
*  Who is the big brother to all those villanova guys like the same way all this college shit works where it's like, oh, yeah
*  Kyle lowry came back. He's gonna take us out to a steak dinner because he's making money in the mba
*  Now now they have to play against him and then you have this whole philly new york thing, which is hilarious because
*  There's only two things that new york really treats with complete disdain which are red sox fans pre 2004 and
*  Really the entire city of philadelphia sean is that fair?
*  Well, i'm not a giants fan. So I don't have the same level of disgust with the eagles, but that's a blood feud
*  I mean they those two franchises their fan bases hate each other
*  The nicks and the sixers don't have any energy between them the phillies i'll i'll burn the phillies alive
*  I'll burn every member of that team to like they I hate those guys and honestly, they're really good
*  And it just pisses me off
*  So chris and I were talking about the other day and he had some unkind words for his own phillies
*  No, I was just like I would love to see a little bit of october in the in the in the late spring
*  I would love to see the bats warm up before it gets cold out again
*  That's that's the only thing with the phillies
*  But it's like you just what you wind up waiting for them to go to go nuts towards the end of the season
*  I think that uh
*  Wait, hold on chris one thing that I I do have to say to answer your question bill
*  The only thing that really unites chris and I more on this is how much we fucking hate boston
*  I mean really the celtics are the true enemy here and you know it
*  Yeah, this whole like pitting me and shawn against one another what?
*  These two piranhas in a tank kill one another and we're just done with basketball by the time the east conference finals comes along
*  This is a fat fucking chance. That's not happening
*  Are you guys gonna watch a game together i'm sure yeah, probably probably yeah, really if that say I never do that
*  Crick crick, you know chris is i'm i'm i'm a bad person right i'm vindictive and i'm i'm i'm vengeful and i'm a cry baby
*  Chris is like he's the the best guy like he won't make it hard on me
*  He'll always be decent in those environments that being said I have a lot of other friends from philadelphia for which that is not the case
*  And so I probably won't watch with them
*  So zach barron
*  I'm, not naming any names. Okay last night
*  It was the first time it got really real for me like it's been it's been an interesting season because I was like man nick
*  nurses
*  Really good at coaching basketball and this team is really well balanced and I really liked them and if it wasn't
*  For this dumb juggernaut boston team who shoots 53 as a game like we might be
*  Real finals contenders and then b goes out and I was like all right
*  well
*  I've emotionally divested from this and then last night like
*  I I can't I I just don't I don't want to say straight up that I was happy that jimmy butler got hurt, but
*  I think that my reaction in my living room would indicate that I was
*  Okay, you know like that's and so that I got back in I was like
*  Living and dying with every possession and that was intense
*  But I think I can behave myself around sean not around you though if the sixers played the celtics on this eastern conference finals
*  It's war
*  Sean is brunson in
*  Top eight new york athletes of your lifetime that you've loved is he has he cracked the top 15 like
*  I think an extended playoff run this year would go a long way to cementing that you know that would get him
*  Into his viewing status. Yeah
*  Yeah, well, I mean ewing has finals under his belt at least right like who are who are the guys in in my life?
*  It's a very very short list. It's like david right, you know what I mean?
*  It's just not a lot of guys since 1995 who have been
*  Yeah, yeah, er Rogers. Absolutely. Yeah, especially in the offseason anytime you got a microphone in front of his face
*  He's he's right up there in the top eight. He's in like my top eight myspace friends. Yeah
*  testiverty
*  Yeah, literally we're talking about vinny testiverty, you know, like that's tough. It's really tough a couple jacob de grahm yours
*  No, it's always like the brickechauff ferguson
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like it's like left tackles like I don't have a lot of dudes that I can call back to one of the things about
*  we mentioned this side of the bracket bill, but like
*  I gotta admit like
*  I'm pretty i'm pretty keyed up about like yannis being out, you know
*  and and this idea that this side of the bracket is kind of up for grabs a little bit like
*  No, at least the bucks are not a certainty to even beat the pacers much less go through in the second round
*  So like I think this is like a huge series for the conference itself. Wow. Look at that
*  Why do you have a dame willard bobblehead?
*  I bought it on ebay because I thought if he sucked in the playoffs
*  It would be funny and if he got going in the playoffs would be funny
*  But either way, I just needed some more props for my playoff zoom
*  Are you sticking needles in it like a voodoo doll? No, he's just he's dames just right here
*  He's just enjoying the podcast hanging out with you guys. You have a lot of stock in dame
*  The dame trade was a bad idea too. So you really need them to tank out here. I gotta be honest. Yeah already cashed it
*  Yeah, you took all that money and spent it on drollities
*  Drooling the bucks you think the bucks would bucks fans want to do the dame trade again?
*  I mean he would have to drop 35 a game in the playoffs to even make them feel decent about it
*  That that watching him that orlando game was shocking
*  Because they had the bucks were trying in that game and he he literally couldn't do anything
*  Who are you? Okay bill, who are you most afraid of then on the to face in the eastern conference finals?
*  Uh, it would be philly if imbede was if imbede shows that he's playing himself back in the shape and he actually could be
*  I don't think it's safe though. I think it's more like the knee itself is still hurt
*  So it's not going to be like oh and he just got like his wind back
*  It's going to be can he play with the pain which honestly at this point i'm kind of used to i'm kind of used to
*  That being who he is. Yeah, it would be i'm not afraid of philly. I i'm just I don't think he's going to be healthy
*  All the teams are in the west for me
*  And if the celtics like put this way the celtics loot they're minus 220 to win the eastbound fando now
*  which is a crazy number like you like that's like a
*  2017 warriors type of number for them to blow this
*  before
*  Round four would either somebody got hurt or it's one of the biggest chokes in the history of the city
*  The one seat statistically though is not always isn't it? It's kind of rare right that it's always the one seat that goes to the finals
*  Yeah, but in this case when you're talking the company they're in from point differential and net rating with the greatest teams of all time
*  It would be the most shocking
