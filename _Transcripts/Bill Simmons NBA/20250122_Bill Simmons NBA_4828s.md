# An NBA Fake Trade Fiesta With Kevin O’Connor | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI)
*  Unfortunately, we had to tape this a little late on Wednesday because I was flying back [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=0.0s)]
*  from Boston this morning. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4.16s)]
*  And then there was a Wi-Fi issue on the plane. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=6.0s)]
*  And I'm like, is this going to work out? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=8.88s)]
*  Am I going to be able to do a podcast today? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=10.44s)]
*  The Wi-Fi miraculously came back. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=11.76s)]
*  And then I was on my iPad for hours making fake trades. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=13.96s)]
*  And I think a couple of times the lady next to me was like, what's this guy doing? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=17.64s)]
*  What is this trade machine that he has? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=21.2s)]
*  But before we do that, a bunch of teams I want to hit, just big picture, that kind of [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=23.64s)]
*  relate to this in some ways. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=28.68s)]
*  Biggest one, Dallas. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=29.92s)]
*  I think Dallas is in real trouble now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=32.6s)]
*  This lively injury, it's a foot injury and they're saying out two to three months. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=34.28s)]
*  And as I've said a million times, I never trust feet injuries. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=38.88s)]
*  I always feel like they're not being honest about how long the timetable is because [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=42.24s)]
*  I'm not sure they know. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  And I always go worst case scenario. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=47.88s)]
*  Three months takes us into the playoffs. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  It takes us into round one. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  And on top of it, Lucas hurt. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=54.36s)]
*  And I just I thought Dallas was going to be there in the end. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=55.8s)]
*  This is the first time I got worried. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=58.48s)]
*  Yeah, I think with this lively injury, there's been some trickling out for a few days [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=60.4s)]
*  that like, oh, maybe they're going to go after a center. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=64.32s)]
*  But I'm like, huh, maybe they want to just have some versatility in the front court. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=66.36s)]
*  But now that we know about the injury, it completely explains why. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=70.4s)]
*  Right. Going for a center here. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=73.44s)]
*  And so my question is, what type of center are they going to go for? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=74.64s)]
*  They're going to go for another, you know, lob vertical guy like lively, like Gafford. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=78.12s)]
*  But if you add a third guy like that and then lively comes back, you can't. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=82.92s)]
*  Then what then what's your sense? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=87.28s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=89.12s)]
*  So I wonder if maybe for them, they still go after, you know, a pick and pop big [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  or a switchable big somebody like that to give them some front court versatility. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=93.92s)]
*  But Gafford looked damn good. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=97.76s)]
*  And the first half of their game on Sunday. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=99.68s)]
*  So like Gaffer, we know he can step his play up. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=101.76s)]
*  So I wouldn't say I don't think I'd go as far as you to say that they're screwed. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  But it is going to be a lot dependent on what they do to fill that center gap, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=109.80000000000001s)]
*  because it can't just be Gafford. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  That's all they have now. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=114.64s)]
*  Well, they're screwed in this respect. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=115.88000000000001s)]
*  Right now, they're seventh in the West. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=117.68s)]
*  They're 23 and 20. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  Doesn't look like Lucas coming back until the All-Star break. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=120.72s)]
*  There's teams that are just settled in way ahead of them. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=124.0s)]
*  Now, the top four, Oklahoma, Houston, Memphis, Denver. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=126.4s)]
*  I just don't think they're catching any of those teams, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=130.20000000000002s)]
*  especially with the way Denver's playing. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=132.32s)]
*  So now you're looking at I don't have home court advantage any round. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=133.8s)]
*  I don't know when Labley's coming back. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=136.88s)]
*  They also made a lot of trades already. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=138.88s)]
*  They don't have like a shitload of assets. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=140.56s)]
*  You know, they've already made a lot of their moves and they would have to dip [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=142.24s)]
*  into the clay PJ Washington, like that kind of group to improve [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=145.68s)]
*  with their need to improve. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=150.28s)]
*  So I'm sure their game plan is just going to be we're probably going to be [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=151.28s)]
*  in that seven to 10 range. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=154.32s)]
*  Let's hope Labley comes back. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=155.88s)]
*  Let's hope Luca gets going. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=157.52s)]
*  We'll be there in the end. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=158.76s)]
*  But pretty tough, man, if you're in those playing games [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=161.0s)]
*  and then you're on the road every round, we haven't really seen [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=163.88s)]
*  we haven't seen a lot of success with that recipe. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=167.72s)]
*  Koc. I mean, even with a healthy lively, I'm curious, like, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=169.64s)]
*  do you still view them as like upper tier in the Western Conference [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=173.28s)]
*  right on the same level as Denver, who's really come along lately? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=176.56s)]
*  Come along. Like Russell Westbrook, you've got to give the dude credit. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=180.72s)]
*  He is playing at the best, best level that he has in years. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=184.12s)]
*  Jamal Murray getting a lot better now. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  Danny Chow wrote about it for us. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=189.68s)]
*  It's the most improbable relationship we've had in the NBA this decade. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=191.12s)]
*  Yokochi and Westbrook somehow like joining forces in a positive way. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=194.64s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=198.96s)]
*  It's kind of crazy. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=200.04s)]
*  Like with Russ, it didn't work with LeBron. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=201.32s)]
*  It works sometimes with the Clippers, but not all the time. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=204.04s)]
*  It didn't in one of their playoff and not at the end. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=206.72s)]
*  Yeah. And then with Yokoach, it's like you have Yokoach after the game [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  talking about like we can read each other's minds. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=212.24s)]
*  Like there is some chemistry that they have. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=214.88s)]
*  It feels like every other game. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=216.6s)]
*  Once it's Yokoach and Westbrook, then it's Yokoach and Murray. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=218.4s)]
*  Then it's Yokoach and MPJ. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  It's always a different connection like they're they're often. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=222.96s)]
*  Sometimes I felt like it got a bit dry. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=225.72s)]
*  Like sometimes it was always Yokoach, Murray end of game situations. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=228.24s)]
*  But there's variety now that makes me think, wait a minute, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=231.60000000000002s)]
*  is Denver actually just the only true contender besides OKC [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=234.28s)]
*  in the Western Conference? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=238.76000000000002s)]
*  They actually the team that could take them down because I'm not [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  I'm not totally sold on Dallas anyway. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=242.56s)]
*  I think they have too many holes. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=244.56s)]
*  I'm still worried about Lucas Health. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=245.8s)]
*  I mean, when you're coming back post all star break, right, that type of injury, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=247.44s)]
*  it's that's the type of thing that can get hurt again. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=251.16s)]
*  And Kyrie in and out still as well. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=253.52s)]
*  A lot of questions there with them even prior to Lively. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=255.68s)]
*  But the flip side of this is why it was stupid to give up on Denver a month ago. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=259.32s)]
*  If you have one of the best six players in the league, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=264.12s)]
*  you just have to be taken seriously in the playoffs. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=265.96s)]
*  So the question for me is, can he get back to the right shape? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=268.08s)]
*  When can Lively come back? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=273.08s)]
*  Can they sneak out like if they're playing Houston in round one at two seven, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=275.08s)]
*  they could beat Houston. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=280.0s)]
*  I don't know if Houston has another gear, so I'm sure they're not totally panicking yet, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=281.4s)]
*  but it's not great, you know, and you think like Lucas 26 now. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=285.23999999999995s)]
*  They made the finals last year. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  They really went all in on this season and Oklahoma City kind of took their spot. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=291.76s)]
*  But yeah, I'm not I'm not a full level panic. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=296.23999999999995s)]
*  I don't like the fact that they're not going to have home court any route every round. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=299.08s)]
*  And I also don't know what the trade move is. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  So next one is Philly, who is borderline [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=304.08s)]
*  shut it down territory. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=308.28s)]
*  But you also look at the East and it's like, yeah, they could make the playing game. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=309.4s)]
*  And what if they have those guys in mid April and they're all healthy? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=312.23999999999995s)]
*  And I don't really know what the answer is. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=315.76s)]
*  But the big thing is their first pick is top six protected, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=317.2s)]
*  which everybody's been talking about all week. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=320.03999999999996s)]
*  And I thought about how OKC gets that pick, right? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=322.32s)]
*  If it's like seventh in a really good draft, then I'm sure I'm sure you've been [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  become fascinated by this is the Sam Presti revenge on Darrell Maury. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=329.44s)]
*  The James Harden trade 2012, right? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=335.59999999999997s)]
*  And it became this thing that that became this curse over OKC. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=338.28s)]
*  And they never got to the finals. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  And Darrell kind of made his career in a lot of ways. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=344.67999999999995s)]
*  The flip side of this OKC gets this pick [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=347.84s)]
*  because Philly has to dump Al Horford, right? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=351.32s)]
*  And now this pick is paralyzing Philly with their decisions because. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=354.4s)]
*  You maybe want to just throw away the season, and yet you can [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=359.52s)]
*  if Embiid is going to be healthy in two weeks. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=362.84s)]
*  So what do you do if you're Philly? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=365.11999999999995s)]
*  I don't think you can throw away the season. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=366.88s)]
*  You can't like you said, with Embiid, if he's healthy, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=368.44s)]
*  they've been good after he got back in December. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=371.32s)]
*  Granted, he's missed a lot of time since then. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=373.56s)]
*  But if Embiid is healthy, you know, you're competitive. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=375.04s)]
*  The problem is the fact that you get Paul George and you're saying, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=377.71999999999997s)]
*  well, he's just going to be better than Tobias Harris. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  He's going to be way better than Harris. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=384.64s)]
*  It has been for us. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=386.2s)]
*  And then he looks like Tobias Harris for you. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=387.64s)]
*  And so if Paul George is actually. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=391.04s)]
*  Is that an insult to Tobias Harris? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=393.0s)]
*  I'm not I'm not sure. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=394.6s)]
*  Yeah, it is, because Tobias Harris is very average, below average [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=396.2s)]
*  with the Sixers, and he's been pretty good with the pistons. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=399.44s)]
*  No, I'm saying is to but would Tobias Harris listen to this and be like, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=402.0s)]
*  you know, I've been better than Paul George. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=405.0s)]
*  At least I play it. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=406.4s)]
*  That would be fair if he did say that he's at least been on the court. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=409.0s)]
*  Well, with Paul George, he just looks like a complete shell of his former self. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=412.32s)]
*  So if the Paul George decline is beginning [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=415.71999999999997s)]
*  and this isn't just an off year at 35, 36 years old, whatever he is, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=418.28s)]
*  you have to take advantage of these years, especially if [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=422.88s)]
*  like a beat is healthy come April and you sneak in as the seven or the eight seed [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=425.92s)]
*  that you can't wait to hear the seven or the eight seed. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=431.04s)]
*  They're going to be nine or 10, but they could still sneak in [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=433.88s)]
*  because they'd have to win two playing games. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=436.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I mean. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=438.48s)]
*  If they win the two playing games and they sneak in in that case [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=439.16s)]
*  and there's the seven or eight like you got to you have to go for that [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=441.8s)]
*  possibility, you can't completely tank out here. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=445.04s)]
*  But if he doesn't come back, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=447.56s)]
*  moving up in the lottery is your silver lining here for Philadelphia. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=450.04s)]
*  But I don't think you can tank for that. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=454.84000000000003s)]
*  It's not worth doing that. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=456.88s)]
*  You at least have to go for it. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=458.16s)]
*  Otherwise, it's another year wasted. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=459.32s)]
*  And for Darrell Mori in the front office as well and Nick Nurse [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=460.92s)]
*  as head coach, that could mean your job, too. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=464.52000000000004s)]
*  If they do miss the playoffs and if next year they go into things [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=466.96000000000004s)]
*  and it's not better, you might not get another job anytime soon. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=470.12s)]
*  So I don't think they have much of a choice but to go for it now. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=472.96000000000004s)]
*  We have hit Fall Guy range. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=475.8s)]
*  And it's going to be the nurse or Darrell. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=478.96000000000004s)]
*  And I don't know which one it's going to be, but we're very close. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=480.96000000000004s)]
*  At this point, those guys don't play hard for a nurse at all. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=484.36s)]
*  But now they don't seem like they it just we've seen this happen [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=488.28000000000003s)]
*  over the course of the NBA history. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=492.24s)]
*  Like Don Nelson was a great coach. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=493.84000000000003s)]
*  He took over the UE Knicks at one point in the mid 90s. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=496.04s)]
*  And I think he lasted like 45 games. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=498.76s)]
*  It just didn't work. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=500.68s)]
*  I don't know if it's that bad for them. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=501.92s)]
*  But when you don't have two of your best three guys basically never playing, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=504.08000000000004s)]
*  you know, they had this huge stretch last week. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=508.48s)]
*  It was like four and five against all good teams. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=510.40000000000003s)]
*  And Embiid missed all the games and then he met and then they were like, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=512.76s)]
*  he's probably at at least another week. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=515.72s)]
*  If you look at their schedule, any game where he would come back, it's a good team. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=517.4s)]
*  There's like always like a Boston or a Cleveland. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=522.12s)]
*  There's some somebody on there and I just I don't think he's going to come back [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=524.08s)]
*  until he's healthy. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=527.36s)]
*  I think I don't think he wants to come back at his ass kick. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=528.36s)]
*  So I don't know if you're Nick Durst, what do you do on that? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=530.36s)]
*  But the Paul George piece is the shocking thing. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=533.12s)]
*  I guess we should have known he's been in the league a while that it was possible. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=535.92s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=539.04s)]
*  I don't know. He was always hit or miss, but he hit and he's not hitting anymore. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=541.84s)]
*  There's it's more misses or I forgot you were out there than hits. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=546.5200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, at the least, at a minimum, he was a far better spot up shooter [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=550.8000000000001s)]
*  than Tobias Harris. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=554.88s)]
*  He's always a pump 40 percent from three Tobias Harris was very streaky [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=556.36s)]
*  and consistent and lower volume. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=560.36s)]
*  This year, Paul George, only 35 percent from three has not been a knockdown guy [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=562.12s)]
*  on top of, you know, just stinking it up. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=565.88s)]
*  End of game situations, losing control of the ball [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=568.6s)]
*  in the final minutes of games, real careless turnovers. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=571.24s)]
*  And the defense is not at a lockdown level for that matter either. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=574.52s)]
*  So like the things that you thought at a minimum were getting elite defender [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=577.84s)]
*  and knockdown shooter who can sometimes go off. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=581.8000000000001s)]
*  You're not even getting the role player stuff from him right now. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=584.52s)]
*  And so that's where you're Philadelphia. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=587.44s)]
*  If he's not producing, I don't know if there's an answer [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=590.36s)]
*  for you to solve that at all with this. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=594.64s)]
*  Rossi, you were banking on Paul George. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=596.48s)]
*  You waited for him in free agency. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=598.36s)]
*  That's what the whole plan was, was to go out and get Paul George for seven months. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=600.32s)]
*  This was the plan. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=604.8000000000001s)]
*  So if he's not working out, nobody's going to take him for that matter. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=605.64s)]
*  Who do you think's the most relieved? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=608.12s)]
*  Orlando, the Clippers. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=610.24s)]
*  I wonder who else would have been in the mix on that. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=613.28s)]
*  Well, Golden State was in the mix for Paul George to Golden State. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=615.36s)]
*  Oh, yeah. But they were trying. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=618.48s)]
*  Can you be relieved if you're them, though? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=620.72s)]
*  You're super average this year. Yeah. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=622.44s)]
*  You're a five. Yeah. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=624.76s)]
*  So we agree Philly needs to use those picks, though. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=626.64s)]
*  They have four tradeable picks. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=628.76s)]
*  They need to use those, I'd say. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=630.04s)]
*  Would you use McCain, who's out for the year? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=631.72s)]
*  I don't know. He looks pretty damn good, though. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=636.24s)]
*  Long term, McCain, Maxey is your backcourt. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=639.3199999999999s)]
*  Does that is that a backcourt that makes sense to you from a basketball standpoint? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=641.52s)]
*  It's too it's too small. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=644.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's too small. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=646.1999999999999s)]
*  But I think McCain's value would only go up to me. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=647.36s)]
*  I mean, I think like everybody talks about Jimmy Butler as a as a guide [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=650.08s)]
*  to Phoenix and, you know, all these other teams. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=654.56s)]
*  Nobody ever mentions Philly. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=656.52s)]
*  What if Philly offered three firsts with Paul George [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=658.0s)]
*  to reunite Jimmy Butler with Joe Alamide? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=662.0799999999999s)]
*  Maybe you don't do that if you're Philly. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=664.52s)]
*  Maybe you keep your tradeable picks and go elsewhere. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=665.88s)]
*  But I'm just throwing the idea out there. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=668.72s)]
*  And maybe Miami rolls the dice and Paul George has a longer term salary. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=670.72s)]
*  I have Paul George coming up later when we get to the fake trade section [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=674.52s)]
*  of this podcast, because it's a fascinating topic. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=677.96s)]
*  So we agree Philly's not shutting it down. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=682.0799999999999s)]
*  They still have a chance to be a nine or a ten seed. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=684.92s)]
*  If they can get all those guys healthy for two months, that's still the plan. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=687.76s)]
*  And if I'm Darrell Maury, like that's a better chance [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=691.56s)]
*  than keeping my fingers crossed in the lottery. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=694.04s)]
*  OK, next one. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=695.72s)]
*  New Orleans is in what the fuck land where they suck. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=697.92s)]
*  But now that all their guys are back, they're actually like [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=701.68s)]
*  pretty solid and really talented and Trey Murphy's been playing great. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=705.0s)]
*  And they might be too talented to be a full tank team, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=708.8s)]
*  a lot of Brooklyn and teams like that. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=712.3199999999999s)]
*  They have some good trade assets. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=714.28s)]
*  Ingram as an expiring is hurt right now. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=715.8s)]
*  Zion year to year, you can get out. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=717.8399999999999s)]
*  CJ McCollum overpriced, but reasonable [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=720.04s)]
*  for somebody who needs a scoring something. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=725.0s)]
*  And then I guess Murray. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=728.1999999999999s)]
*  That roster doesn't really make sense. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=730.68s)]
*  I don't even know what the move is. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=733.68s)]
*  What do they do? What do you do if you're running New Orleans? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=735.72s)]
*  I think you just keep it going. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=739.12s)]
*  Honestly, I wouldn't I wouldn't necessarily tank it out [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=740.6s)]
*  unless you're getting a really, really good deal from McCollum. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=743.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think trading CJ McCollum would definitely be top of my list [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=746.2s)]
*  aside from the obvious. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=750.32s)]
*  Nobody is going to be upset at me again because he thinks [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=752.04s)]
*  I always throw him in trade rumors. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=754.36s)]
*  I mean, nobody's wanted Ingram for a year and a half, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=757.08s)]
*  especially now that he's hurt. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=760.12s)]
*  Yeah. Yes. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=761.28s)]
*  Is that going to change in the next three weeks here with McCollum? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=762.16s)]
*  At least he has had some banger performances as of late. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=765.6s)]
*  He's looked healthy. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=768.84s)]
*  He looks very good for them right now. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=770.08s)]
*  So maybe you're trading McCollum. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=771.6800000000001s)]
*  The issue is the fact that he's a tough guy to trade at 33 million dollars [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=773.04s)]
*  this year. He's still a smaller, smaller guard. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=776.8399999999999s)]
*  So for New Orleans, part of me, Bill, looks at this as [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=779.5999999999999s)]
*  a year in which your horrible start with Zion missing time [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=784.12s)]
*  keeps you in the lottery. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=789.0s)]
*  It's going to keep you having good draft odds. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=790.7199999999999s)]
*  So if you do and then the late. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=793.04s)]
*  Yes. So if you win towards the end of the season, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=795.0s)]
*  maybe you actually have some clarity on what you want to do heading into the summer. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=797.12s)]
*  So I'm not totally against keeping things together [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=800.8000000000001s)]
*  because you're going to have a lottery pick anyway. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=803.08s)]
*  You're not going to get into the play and as you're too far back right now. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=805.52s)]
*  So I'm OK with keeping things together right now. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=808.8000000000001s)]
*  And if Zion is back to prime Zion for the whole rest of the season. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=810.96s)]
*  Yeah, I think that maybe gives you an idea of what you want to do in the summer [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=815.96s)]
*  if you're the Pelicans versus dumping things right now just for slightly higher odds. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=819.32s)]
*  You just stumbled into the answer. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=823.76s)]
*  These next two months are about building back Zion up as a genuine asset. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=825.88s)]
*  And then trying to get out of that, get out of that situation as fast as you can. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=830.12s)]
*  So you're still ejecting from the Zion situation. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=834.5999999999999s)]
*  I am. I know he's healthy for two months that trade trade when the value is high. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=837.0s)]
*  There are 11 wins or 11 losses behind Phoenix for the 10 seed. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=843.28s)]
*  That's great. So there's no scenario where they catch fire, unfortunately. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=848.28s)]
*  We're one of the things about trading McCollum is then you could play Jordan Hawkins more. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=852.56s)]
*  It's weird. They're they're deep. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=856.8s)]
*  But they also have a terrible record. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=858.84s)]
*  They make no sense as a as a team of assets. Anyway. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=860.44s)]
*  Next one. I didn't know it was going to be today. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=866.12s)]
*  What's today's date? January 22nd. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=869.32s)]
*  I thought it was going to be after the Celtics game. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=871.84s)]
*  The next day when we celebrated the annual Lakers holiday passive aggressive trade day [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=874.24s)]
*  when some report comes out that LeBron and AD or just LeBron aren't happy with the roster. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=879.8000000000001s)]
*  It happened today. It was January 22nd. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=885.6s)]
*  I wish I had had Fandel put odds with all the different days in January when it was going to happen. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=887.56s)]
*  But it happened today. LeBron and AD apparently really want them to improve the roster. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=892.3199999999999s)]
*  They're not that happy with it. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=897.56s)]
*  I don't know what the move is, KOC. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=900.5999999999999s)]
*  When you're paying those two guys a hundred plus million dollars a year and you have Reeves, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=902.3199999999999s)]
*  your roster is pretty good. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=907.88s)]
*  And maybe look in the mirror a little bit. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=910.28s)]
*  And I went through everybody. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=912.28s)]
*  If it's Rui and Vanderbilt and Vincent and two firsts, I don't even know what you're getting. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=914.32s)]
*  Who's available? If it's a top 50 player, nobody wants to trade a top 50 player. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=918.4s)]
*  So you're looking at people like Zach Levine. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=922.8000000000001s)]
*  And if they got Zach Levine, I just don't think they're a contender in the West. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=925.84s)]
*  They would have the same problems they have anywhere where they can't guard anybody. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=928.8000000000001s)]
*  I would never. Reeves is a hang up for me. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=932.32s)]
*  If somebody called about Reeves at 12 billion a year, it's like, yeah, I'm sure you do want us to Reeves. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=935.2800000000001s)]
*  Fuck off. Hang up. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=940.4000000000001s)]
*  I don't know what the move is for them. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=942.32s)]
*  I don't know how they're a title contender. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=943.84s)]
*  And I have some ideas zagging the other way. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=945.48s)]
*  But what do you think? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=948.2800000000001s)]
*  If you're trying to add, which I don't think they're going to go the other way, Walker Kessler is a center. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=950.36s)]
*  Try to go get him from Utah. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=956.2s)]
*  Then you can play two big lineups. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=957.48s)]
*  Are you winning four rounds if you make a Walker Kessler trade? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=959.24s)]
*  No, just just one of the names. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=962.24s)]
*  You can trade two picks. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=964.64s)]
*  You can trade multiple swaps. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=966.0400000000001s)]
*  You do have some tradable salaries. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=968.1600000000001s)]
*  So maybe that's one of the guys you go for. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=970.24s)]
*  And I don't know if you and I feel the same way about this guy, Bill, but I think everything's that Levine has done this year. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=972.6800000000001s)]
*  Forget it. We're aligned on that. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=979.96s)]
*  OK, so like to me, like if you're able to put a package together for Zach Levine and it's a tough deal, it probably have to be a three way. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=981.48s)]
*  But if you go get Zach Levine and add him to the bunch with LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and you're able to go get a five like Walker Kessler. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=989.48s)]
*  You have Dory and Finney Smith already. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=998.8000000000001s)]
*  You have Austin Reeves like suddenly you have like a really good top six, top seven with a lot of dynamic scoring ability, versatility on defense, different lineup configurations that you can play. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1000.48s)]
*  So I think the Lakers should be adding. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1012.0799999999999s)]
*  They should try to trade their 29 and 31. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1014.6s)]
*  They should try to trade their swaps. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1017.1999999999999s)]
*  They should try to go for something here. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1019.0s)]
*  If I was a Laker fan, I would be losing my mind at this. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1020.76s)]
*  You want to watch it? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1024.3200000000002s)]
*  Really? We're going to mortgage basically the next six years so we can fulfill the charade that we're a title contender. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1025.04s)]
*  There's no chance against Oklahoma City. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1032.04s)]
*  What if you slightly protect those picks? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1033.96s)]
*  I wouldn't do it. I would zag the other way. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1037.44s)]
*  And if Reeves is in a trade, they're just flat out stupid. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1039.24s)]
*  What's the other way? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1042.2s)]
*  Does that mean trading AD, trading LeBron? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1043.0s)]
*  I have an AD idea. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1045.68s)]
*  OK. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1047.6000000000001s)]
*  I think they should think about zagging the other way and trading AD. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1047.88s)]
*  And, you know, it's a really interesting thing to bring up to Laker fans because I think they're grateful they won the title in 2020. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1051.5600000000002s)]
*  But I also feel like they don't want to lose the entire decade trying to pretend that they can win a title with these two guys as their best players because they can't. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1058.2s)]
*  You know, and you watch them. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1067.0s)]
*  First of all, did you see that stat about how their record versus what the record actually is? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1068.5600000000002s)]
*  Like how far the expected win rate or whatever that status, which backs up what I've watched. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1075.16s)]
*  Like they've lucked out with some schedule stuff. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1080.68s)]
*  I don't think they're that good. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1083.5200000000002s)]
*  And I think they know they're not that good. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1084.6000000000001s)]
*  Whatever their record is, you like they're going to play the Celtics tomorrow night and LeBron will have his A game. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1086.2800000000002s)]
*  And they're just not good enough defensively at the Celtics play well. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1091.64s)]
*  Granted, the Celtics could go 7 for 50 from three and get smoked in a second game back to back. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1094.3200000000002s)]
*  But defensively, they're just not good enough. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1099.44s)]
*  And I don't know if Walker Kessler is changing that. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1102.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1105.3200000000002s)]
*  If you look at the teams in the NBA right now with 23 plus wins, the only two teams with a negative point differential are Magic minus 0.5 and the Lakers minus two. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1105.56s)]
*  And the Magic lost their two best players for most of the season. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1117.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1121.44s)]
*  Yep. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1122.32s)]
*  And the Lakers, they're the only team in the West top six right now with a negative plus minus on the entire season. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1122.68s)]
*  I just don't see it. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1128.6s)]
*  I would not give away the rest of the future just because LeBron wants a better team. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1129.32s)]
*  You know, part of it is you insisted on the Anthony Davis trade. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1138.24s)]
*  You guys won a title for it. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1142.32s)]
*  You gave away all of these assets. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1143.52s)]
*  You struck oil with Reeves. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1145.92s)]
*  That was one of the luckiest things that could have happened to any team to get a guy. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1147.96s)]
*  Was he undrafted or a second runner? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1152.8799999999999s)]
*  He was undrafted, right? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1154.2s)]
*  Pretty sure he went undrafted. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1156.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1157.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1158.16s)]
*  And then they get him on this crazy contract because he didn't go out and shop himself. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1158.88s)]
*  So he's like 12 billion a year for, you know, that's one of the best contracts in the league. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1162.8400000000001s)]
*  So if you just look at those three things and the role players they have, you would think they would be better than they are. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1167.1200000000001s)]
*  But can't guard anybody. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1171.72s)]
*  Last team is Miami. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1173.96s)]
*  So the Butler thing is this is about as bad of a player team situation as we've had in a while. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1177.5600000000002s)]
*  It's also the NBA I grew up with where stars would just get mad at teams. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1183.3200000000002s)]
*  Stars miss planes. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1186.6s)]
*  You know, even data going into the two thousands, this would happen with people like Vince Carter. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1189.12s)]
*  I don't know what his trade value is anymore. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1193.6799999999998s)]
*  And I don't think you probably do either. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1195.6s)]
*  I don't know what he's worth. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1198.28s)]
*  I can't decide because he can opt in next year. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1199.76s)]
*  He's such a headache. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1203.52s)]
*  He's 35. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1205.08s)]
*  You know, they have to trade them. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1206.4399999999998s)]
*  Why am I offering anything for him? [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1207.7199999999998s)]
*  And he also hasn't done anything since game two of the East finals against the Celtics two years ago in 2023. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1209.6399999999999s)]
*  He was inefficient the rest of that series, inefficient against Denver. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1215.96s)]
*  Missed time the last two years for suspensions, for being a malcontent, for injuries, for age. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1219.68s)]
*  I don't know what he's actually worth at this point for all those reasons. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1226.52s)]
*  So I don't even know if I'd want to trade for him if I'm the sons. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1230.48s)]
*  I get the appeal. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1233.9199999999998s)]
*  He's better than Bradley Beal. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1234.72s)]
*  If you're going to, obviously they're going to continue trying to build the thing up. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1236.1599999999999s)]
*  If that's the trade, you're doing that. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1239.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1241.9199999999998s)]
*  If it's Bradley Beal, you're doing that. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1242.2s)]
*  Bradley Beal for Butler straight up, which would be just an insane trade for Miami to make. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1243.96s)]
*  I don't know why they would take on an extra year of Bradley Beal. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1247.9199999999998s)]
*  That's why you have like all these rumors trickling out about how it could be a four or five team trade. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1251.04s)]
*  Because somebody else would be taking Beal on the situation. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1258.36s)]
*  And I actually figured out what that trade would be. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1261.32s)]
*  This wasn't one of my fake trades. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1264.6799999999998s)]
*  I got one too for this one. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1267.44s)]
*  I want to know if it came up with the same thing. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1269.3999999999999s)]
*  The part that has to be true is A Beal would want to wave his no trade clause to go to Milwaukee, which I find hard to believe. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1271.0800000000002s)]
*  B Milwaukee would want Bradley Beal for this year and the next two. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1277.16s)]
*  So that you just have to like assume that that might be true. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1280.44s)]
*  I don't think it is. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1283.52s)]
*  Doesn't have to be the bucks for Beal. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1284.28s)]
*  Well, I'm just the trade I came up with was Butler to the sons, Beal to the bucks. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1286.88s)]
*  Miami gets Chris Middleton, Steven Adams from Houston and Cam Whitmore from Houston and Houston gets Brooke Lopez. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1291.92s)]
*  And that actually works. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1299.64s)]
*  Houston would be taking on seven, eight million to turn Adams and Whitmore into Lopez basically. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1301.0800000000002s)]
*  And then all the contracts work. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1307.52s)]
*  Bucks just get Beal on this? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1309.64s)]
*  Bucks just get Beal. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1312.96s)]
*  That's it. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1313.88s)]
*  See, I'm saying no from the bucks. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1315.28s)]
*  I think I am too. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1317.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1318.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1318.64s)]
*  But I think when people talk about four teamers, five teamers, it's a trade like that. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1318.96s)]
*  And I think a team like Houston has to be involved getting turning Adams and one of their younger, cheaper assets in a better center. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1324.12s)]
*  Here's what I got for the Jimmy Butler five way deal. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1333.6399999999999s)]
*  I got so let's get Butler five way, five way sons get Butler. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1336.8s)]
*  Heat get Chris Middleton and Pat Conaton. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1341.1999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1344.4399999999998s)]
*  Bulls get Bradley Beal. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1344.72s)]
*  Bucks get Zach Levine and then the Pistons take Bobby Portis into their cap space. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1347.48s)]
*  And then you distribute some picks to the teams that should get them like the Bulls for taking Beal instead of Levine. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1352.0s)]
*  But that would be the players that work salary wise. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1358.8s)]
*  And so you've got Beal, maybe he'd waive his no trade clause, get reunited with his college coach, Billy Donovan, you know, restore his career there. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1361.28s)]
*  Who knows what his logic would be going there. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1368.96s)]
*  But I don't think there's many teams that Beal would waive his no trade clause for. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1371.16s)]
*  And I thought it was very, very interesting that Mark Bartelstein, his agent, came out again publicly tonight. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1376.08s)]
*  It's the second time he's spoken publicly about Beal and he listed a bunch of teams, the Lakers, the Bucks, the Heat, all these teams. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1381.96s)]
*  He's not waiving his no trade clause for the Bulls weren't mentioned. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1389.96s)]
*  So that might be because the Bulls aren't a team that a lot of people are talking about publicly in this whole scenario. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1393.72s)]
*  But you do have the other stuff reported earlier on Thursday about the Bucks looking at Zach Levine. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1399.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't think the Bucks would want Beal either. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1405.44s)]
*  He's not necessarily an upgrade over this diminished version of Chris Middleton. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1408.04s)]
*  But Zach Levine damn well is an upgrade over what you have in Middleton right now. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1411.48s)]
*  So maybe Beal to the Bulls is something that could make sense there, which is why I came up with those five teams and the Pistons as the fifth team. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1415.8799999999999s)]
*  You could put other teams there, but they're the one with cap space. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1423.36s)]
*  So it's just easy. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1426.12s)]
*  That's good work, KOC. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1427.56s)]
*  Here's he would be my my counter. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1428.92s)]
*  Why would I don't understand why the Bulls have to get rid of Zach Levine? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1432.08s)]
*  He's played really well this year. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1436.3999999999999s)]
*  I actually think he's an asset. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1437.6s)]
*  I want to keep him. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1439.3999999999999s)]
*  We did the Ringer 100. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1440.6399999999999s)]
*  I had him like in the 30s. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1441.7199999999998s)]
*  I watched him single handedly beat like the Knicks, the Celtics. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1443.04s)]
*  Like he's the better the competition is, the more he goes up a level. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1446.4799999999998s)]
*  If I was Milwaukee and I could turn Chris Middleton or another contract in to Zach Levine, I'm doing that in five seconds. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1450.9599999999998s)]
*  He's way better than Bradley Beal. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1457.6799999999998s)]
*  He and plus he plays. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1459.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1461.1599999999999s)]
*  If I'm the sons, I'd probably rather get Zach Levine than Jimmy Butler. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1461.56s)]
*  I think you're right. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1466.6399999999999s)]
*  I mean, I'd like Jimmy Butler, obviously, has proven in the playoffs. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1467.7199999999998s)]
*  He was younger at that time. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1471.28s)]
*  Zach Levine also has not been in those situations. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1472.6799999999998s)]
*  But if you remove last year when he was out for the season with a foot injury, he's been awesome since 2020. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1475.28s)]
*  Awesome. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1482.7199999999998s)]
*  And he has. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1483.32s)]
*  And this year he has the ball a lot, which is like for the Lakers. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1484.3999999999999s)]
*  He makes no sense because he's not going to have the ball nearly as much and he can't play defense. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1487.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1492.3600000000001s)]
*  So if you're trading for him, it has to be a situation like the Rockets won't do it. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1492.72s)]
*  But he's somebody that makes a ton of sense for me if I'm the Rockets, even though he'd hurt a little defensively. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1499.1200000000001s)]
*  He's somebody in the last five minutes of a game can actually like match baskets with whoever the best player in the other team is. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1503.48s)]
*  I think that's his superpower. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1509.8400000000001s)]
*  Not a lot of guys like the sons don't necessarily need that. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1511.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1514.88s)]
*  But if you're talking about the Bucs who already have Damon Giannis, but you're improving the Middleton spot with him, basically the way Middleton's been playing this year. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1515.56s)]
*  Like I think about it. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1524.48s)]
*  I like, we're aligned though. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1527.28s)]
*  I think Levine's been good. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1529.68s)]
*  I hate seeing him get thrown into these trades. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1531.0s)]
*  Like he's not an asset. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1533.8400000000001s)]
*  I think he's an asset. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1534.88s)]
*  It makes no sense. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1536.16s)]
*  I mean, I just pulled up some numbers prior to the recording bill, just, just cause like with Levine, a lot of people still think he's like some diminished asset. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1537.28s)]
*  But four of the last five years, if you remove last season, 45% on catch and shoot threes, 37% on dribble jumper threes, 45% on mid range jumpers, 63% on unassisted shots at the rim. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1544.28s)]
*  He's caught 26 lob dunks. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1556.8s)]
*  That's the fourth most of all guards in the NBA. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1558.84s)]
*  So he's versatile. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1561.68s)]
*  We know he's a great athlete. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1563.6s)]
*  He's an elite shooter off the dribble and off the catch. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1565.08s)]
*  He's versatile with how he gets to those shots, screens and handoffs, pick and roll. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1568.28s)]
*  He can shoot from mid range. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1573.16s)]
*  He can do a lot for your offense and fit into different roles at this point. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1574.5600000000002s)]
*  So just like I just forget about last year, he's been injury prone. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1578.52s)]
*  But last year was the only year where it actually affected his performance ever since 2020. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1582.16s)]
*  So to me, if I'm the bulls, I'd be happy to keep him. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1586.96s)]
*  I know that creates some roster issues with Kobe White and all that. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1590.3600000000001s)]
*  Maybe you end up flipping him instead. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1593.76s)]
*  But Kobe White's also on a value contract. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1595.72s)]
*  But Levine's been awesome, dude. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1597.92s)]
*  I can't understand why he's still viewed as some horrible asset at this point. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1599.76s)]
*  The only reason to trade him is if you feel like your team doctors who have spent a lot of time with him are like, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1605.84s)]
*  sell high right now. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1611.04s)]
*  This is it. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1612.2s)]
*  He's going to get hurt too much. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1613.84s)]
*  That's the only reason. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1615.0s)]
*  Maybe you do. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1615.56s)]
*  Maybe that's what it ends up being. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1616.28s)]
*  Like if the Lakers say, we'll give you two unprotected firsts. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1617.8799999999999s)]
*  If the Suns say, we'll give you Bradley Beal and two or three firsts that we just received [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1620.96s)]
*  in that really interesting deal with the Jazz. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1628.68s)]
*  I would keep him. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1630.76s)]
*  I think he's going to be worth more, especially like next year. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1631.3600000000001s)]
*  There'll only be two years left on his deal. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1634.0s)]
*  They're going to be a playing team unless Philly can catch them. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1636.8s)]
*  And I wouldn't want to play that game in a winner takes all that team in a winner take all where all of a sudden it's a tie game with five minutes left. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1639.92s)]
*  And Zach Levine is doing some of the stuff we've seen him do this year. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1649.16s)]
*  All right. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1652.0800000000002s)]
*  We're aligned on that. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1652.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1653.72s)]
*  I have some fake trades that I don't think will happen, but I thought would be fun to throw at you. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1654.1200000000001s)]
*  And then I want to hit a couple that I do think could happen, should happen, probably won't happen, but at least they're realistic. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1658.8000000000002s)]
*  Trade number one, Bradley Beal for Paul George straight up. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1666.5200000000002s)]
*  Who says no? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1671.2s)]
*  Bradley Beal says no. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1674.8000000000002s)]
*  Bradley Beal says no. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1677.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1678.4s)]
*  All right. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1679.92s)]
*  Let's say he didn't have no trade clause. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1680.16s)]
*  OK, so Bradley Beal has two years left after this year. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1681.76s)]
*  Paul George has three. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1684.68s)]
*  The sons called. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1686.72s)]
*  Phoenix, the Sixers called Phoenix and said, we'll give you Paul George right now for Beal. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1688.9199999999998s)]
*  And the sons are like, really? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1693.8799999999999s)]
*  OK, well, and they decided to do it. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1696.72s)]
*  Beal has that connection with Embiid number Embiid was pushing for him a couple of years ago. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1699.6399999999999s)]
*  I think Phoenix blinks faster with a no than Philly in that trade. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1706.8s)]
*  I think both say no in the end. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1713.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1716.36s)]
*  Philly needs Philly needs that big wing. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1716.6399999999999s)]
*  They have enough guards. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1718.6399999999999s)]
*  They have Maxi McCain's out for the year, but they still have them. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1719.76s)]
*  So you think they say no fast? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1723.08s)]
*  I think Philly says no faster, but both end up saying no. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1725.3999999999999s)]
*  I think Phoenix says no faster, but who knows? [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1728.28s)]
*  All right. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1730.6399999999999s)]
*  Next one. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1730.9199999999998s)]
*  Three teamer. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1732.6s)]
*  Oh, this is. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1735.28s)]
*  Miami gets Kevin Durant. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1737.8799999999999s)]
*  Philly gets Jimmy Butler. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1739.2s)]
*  Phoenix gets Joel Embiid in a two thousand twenty nine for and Philly gets a two thousand [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1742.3600000000001s)]
*  twenty nine first. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1747.24s)]
*  Philly's just out of the Embiid business. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1748.1200000000001s)]
*  They turn Embiid in a two thousand twenty nine first from Miami into Jimmy Butler and they're [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1751.6000000000001s)]
*  just out. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1760.1200000000001s)]
*  Never going to happen. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1762.16s)]
*  But he says no. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1764.68s)]
*  It leads me to this question. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1765.8s)]
*  Would Philly ever consider trading Embiid a B? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1768.3600000000001s)]
*  Would anyone consider trading for Embiid when he plays 40 games a year? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1771.6000000000001s)]
*  Max, is he untradeable? [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1776.4s)]
*  Is he tradeable? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1778.56s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1779.28s)]
*  I think Embiid, I think the Sixers would consider trading Embiid this summer. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1781.84s)]
*  Right now, today, I don't think they would. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1785.76s)]
*  I just don't think you can today. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1787.96s)]
*  I think they would. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1789.68s)]
*  I think they would. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1790.56s)]
*  I think they would. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1791.28s)]
*  I think they would. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1792.04s)]
*  I think they would. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1792.84s)]
*  I think they would. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1793.48s)]
*  I think they would. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1794.2s)]
*  I don't know if they would. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1794.92s)]
*  I don't know if they would. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1795.6000000000001s)]
*  My guess is they would. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1796.16s)]
*  I just don't think you can today. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1796.4s)]
*  But this summer, absolutely, you could. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1798.0s)]
*  He starts a whole new contract. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1799.8400000000001s)]
*  Fifty nine million dollars next season, then sixty four and then sixty nine. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1802.3600000000001s)]
*  The next three years. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1808.5600000000002s)]
*  Can you imagine Josh Harris who also owns Washington, who's playing for the NFC title [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1810.0400000000002s)]
*  on Sunday, and he gets like a call about Sixers and he's like, I don't even care. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1815.72s)]
*  Just whatever. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1819.88s)]
*  Just don't make any trades. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1821.3600000000001s)]
*  I'll deal with that this summer. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1822.64s)]
*  get them out of here. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1824.28s)]
*  By the way, Bob Myers helped Washington [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1825.6399999999999s)]
*  with the football team, right? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1828.92s)]
*  He was on that advisory committee, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1830.22s)]
*  and I just feel like he's looming with the Sixers thing, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1832.32s)]
*  and I don't think I'm alone. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1835.52s)]
*  There's been some Bob Myers-Philly buzz [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1836.6399999999999s)]
*  that I think has been building, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1839.94s)]
*  because I think he had a good experience with Josh Harris. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1841.12s)]
*  Have you heard this? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1843.32s)]
*  Very interesting. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1844.48s)]
*  No, the only thing I heard with Bob Myers [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1845.76s)]
*  is that the Sonics could be a team when they expand, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1847.72s)]
*  whenever the NBA is gonna do that. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1850.6s)]
*  I think Bob Myers is lurking in general, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1852.0s)]
*  but I would not, if there is a fall guy, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1855.16s)]
*  which we talked about earlier, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1858.44s)]
*  it's gonna be Nick Nurse and Darrell Moore, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1859.54s)]
*  and unfortunately, I think the fact that Bob Myers is, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1861.04s)]
*  yeah, maybe it's both. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1864.4s)]
*  One thing that Bob Myers does builds the culture. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1865.44s)]
*  That's what he was famous for, the Warriors, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1868.7s)]
*  and you bring him into Philly, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1870.52s)]
*  so if it gets really bad, I just wouldn't be surprised. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1871.66s)]
*  All right, so we both think- [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1875.16s)]
*  Is Bob a teardown guy? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1876.24s)]
*  If he did get hired by the Sixers, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1879.56s)]
*  was he somebody to reset things, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1881.28s)]
*  or would he try to make it work for the bead? [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1882.92s)]
*  I think he's a, how do we get this to a better place [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1884.96s)]
*  all the way around guy before we decide to blow this up, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1888.24s)]
*  would be my guess. That's what I'm thinking too, yeah. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1891.36s)]
*  Okay, so we both think, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1894.6s)]
*  Embiid, nothing happens until this summer. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1895.92s)]
*  I think more because the rest of the league would be like, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1898.52s)]
*  yeah, cool, Embiid, no thanks. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1901.0s)]
*  Third trade, do we think Brandon Ingram has any value? [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1904.2s)]
*  Not really, very little. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1909.04s)]
*  I'm making like 33, something like that, but it's expiring. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1912.16s)]
*  I think the value is New Orleans takes back a contract [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1917.16s)]
*  with another year on it, and you get a pick as well. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1920.4s)]
*  But Ingram himself, the injuries, the iffy production, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1923.32s)]
*  not a lot of value, and just not a lot of time [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1928.4s)]
*  left on his contract for that matter either. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1929.96s)]
*  If you're Detroit, would you rather have Ingram [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1931.8400000000001s)]
*  for one year or Tobias Harris for two? [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1933.52s)]
*  I'm liking it with Tobias Harris. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1936.3600000000001s)]
*  I don't think I'd want to screw up that chemistry right now. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1937.8400000000001s)]
*  That's a good answer. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1940.52s)]
*  All right, so I'm gonna get rid of them in that trade, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1941.36s)]
*  and I'm gonna knock it down to, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1943.84s)]
*  is there something with San Antonio and McCollum? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1948.96s)]
*  Sorry CJ, I threw you into a trade. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1952.04s)]
*  McCollum, San Antonio has Trey Jones expiring, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1954.72s)]
*  Zach Collins this year, next year, like 16 million. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1958.0s)]
*  They have a little wiggle room [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1962.8799999999999s)]
*  where they could actually make a trade [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1964.36s)]
*  and take a bigger salary back. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1966.0s)]
*  So there's ways to finagle it [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1967.68s)]
*  where they're basically just giving up an expiring. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1969.12s)]
*  Collins, who is a guy next year, they could give up. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1971.4399999999998s)]
*  They have a million picks. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1974.28s)]
*  I want to see the Spurs add one or two guys, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1976.9199999999998s)]
*  and that's gonna be a recurring theme [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1979.7199999999998s)]
*  for the rest of my fake trades. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1981.0s)]
*  There's another version of this [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1983.56s)]
*  where it could be McCollum and Ingram together, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1984.6799999999998s)]
*  going from New Orleans to San Antonio, [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1989.7199999999998s)]
*  and then New Orleans gets Jones, Collins, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1991.56s)]
*  Harrison Barnes expiring, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1994.1599999999999s)]
*  and at least one 2025 first. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=1996.44s)]
*  I want to see San Antonio do something. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2000.52s)]
*  When it's that, if you have a top seven player, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2002.16s)]
*  you can't pretend you don't have a top seven player. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2005.04s)]
*  If you have tradable stuff and a million picks, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2007.04s)]
*  what's wrong with at least tweaking it [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2010.04s)]
*  and going for it a little bit? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2012.4s)]
*  Is it possible you don't want to be too good too soon? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2017.32s)]
*  Why? [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2020.88s)]
*  For the Spurs? [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2021.72s)]
*  I mean, what's wrong with having [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2022.8s)]
*  a lottery pick this year [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2024.64s)]
*  in a draft where you can take Cooper flag [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2026.68s)]
*  if you end up getting lucky with those five or 6% chance [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2028.68s)]
*  with your lottery odds? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2032.8000000000002s)]
*  It's impossible to go under 500 in Wembee. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2035.44s)]
*  What's their record now? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2037.8000000000002s)]
*  19 and 22. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2039.8400000000001s)]
*  19 and 22, all right. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2040.68s)]
*  10th best odds, 3% chance at the number one pick, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2042.68s)]
*  which is unlikely. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2045.52s)]
*  So you're saying there's, right now, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2047.3200000000002s)]
*  there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven teams. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2049.08s)]
*  They're definitely not catching [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2053.84s)]
*  from a loss standpoint, plus Philly. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2055.32s)]
*  I mean, I'd like to see them add two for the right pieces. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2058.08s)]
*  McCollum, Point Garden is 30s. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2062.04s)]
*  I'm iffy there and I don't love the Ingram fit with- [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2065.96s)]
*  Okay, so you wouldn't do anything. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2068.96s)]
*  That's why I put it in the, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2070.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm not sure I would do this camp. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2071.2000000000003s)]
*  I wouldn't do that. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2072.6000000000004s)]
*  There's other stuff I think I would do from the Spurs, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2074.0s)]
*  but I wouldn't do that. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2076.1600000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2077.6000000000004s)]
*  Well, I have another Spurs trade for you. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2079.1600000000003s)]
*  This will never happen. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2081.84s)]
*  I just want to, these four trades I did, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2083.12s)]
*  none of them are happening. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2085.12s)]
*  Do you have a Zion one? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2086.36s)]
*  It's just a fun exercise. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2087.2s)]
*  I'd think about Zion. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2088.2799999999997s)]
*  That'd be fun. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2089.44s)]
*  Well, Zion's coming later. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2090.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2091.84s)]
*  This is the official blow it up trade for Philly, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2093.84s)]
*  where San Antonio gets Paul George, Kyle Lowry, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2097.08s)]
*  and Tyrese Maxey. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2100.72s)]
*  Ooh, wow. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2102.6s)]
*  Philly gets Barnes, Zach Collins, Jones, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2105.72s)]
*  Kelda Johnson, CP3, and a slew of firsts. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2109.24s)]
*  Like just San Antonio, like six firsts, seven firsts, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2114.24s)]
*  whatever you do. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2118.16s)]
*  And basically Philly just gets out of this whole thing. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2119.6s)]
*  They do the super tank and they sell high on Maxey [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2122.3599999999997s)]
*  knowing they have McCain. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2125.2799999999997s)]
*  This will never happen. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2126.2s)]
*  I just want to do it as a thought experiment. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2127.52s)]
*  Maxey, Wemby, that's what I'm talking about. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2129.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2132.3199999999997s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2133.16s)]
*  Yeah. San Antonio overpays. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2134.0s)]
*  They pay 140 cents on the dollar, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2136.04s)]
*  170 cents on the dollar with all the extra picks they have [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2139.88s)]
*  just with the end game being Maxey, Castle, Wemby, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2142.6s)]
*  Fissel, and this is our team going forward. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2147.32s)]
*  It'll never happen. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2150.04s)]
*  You kind of like this one. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2152.4s)]
*  I love it. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2153.64s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I'm into it. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2154.48s)]
*  It's kind of like the same reason why I liked Reed Shepherd [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2155.32s)]
*  for them in the draft because I want that shooting smaller, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2157.7599999999998s)]
*  quick guard, speedy guy to appear with Victor. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2161.6s)]
*  I mean, I know the Chris Paul stuff is working. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2164.6s)]
*  I get it. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2167.0s)]
*  He's almost 40. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2167.84s)]
*  But he moves so slow. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2169.28s)]
*  He can't get into the paint anymore. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2170.52s)]
*  I think Wemby should be getting a lot more lob opportunities [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2172.44s)]
*  than he's been able to, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2176.4s)]
*  but that's because Chris Paul is very slow [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2177.2400000000002s)]
*  and he's not able to beat guys off the dribble [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2179.1200000000003s)]
*  and defense because defenses can just switch. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2180.7200000000003s)]
*  You wouldn't be able to do that as much if it's Maxey [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2182.92s)]
*  or somebody like that. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2185.2400000000002s)]
*  Would you still have Shepherd over Castle with that pick? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2188.52s)]
*  I think so. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2192.56s)]
*  I think so. Really? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2193.7200000000003s)]
*  I love Castle. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2194.76s)]
*  I'm all in on that dude. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2195.96s)]
*  It was so close for me between those guys. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2198.8s)]
*  I think I had it. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2200.6400000000003s)]
*  Shepherd, Castle, Klingon. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2202.2000000000003s)]
*  Who do you have number one in a redraft now? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2205.36s)]
*  Just throw all the teams out. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2208.2000000000003s)]
*  Who do you think the best asset is? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2209.92s)]
*  I don't know if I'd change that right at this point right now. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2211.92s)]
*  I think I'd keep those three. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2214.2000000000003s)]
*  Was it Reed Shepherd's 49 point performance [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2216.1200000000003s)]
*  in the G League that won you over? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2218.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2219.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2220.76s)]
*  Why do you think he hasn't been better in Houston? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2222.88s)]
*  I just think it's a lack of playing time. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2225.36s)]
*  I just have too many guys. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2226.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2228.2s)]
*  I mean, who's he going to play over honestly? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2229.04s)]
*  I kept all my stock. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2229.8799999999997s)]
*  I haven't sold an ounce of Reed Shepherd's stock, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2230.72s)]
*  but I love Castle. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2232.72s)]
*  Castle's awesome. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2234.3599999999997s)]
*  I would take Castle first heading into the draft. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2235.48s)]
*  I would take him first now. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2237.6s)]
*  I love how competitive he is. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2238.7599999999998s)]
*  I feel like he's getting better. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2240.3599999999997s)]
*  I think physically in four years, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2242.24s)]
*  I think he's just going to be just a beast. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2244.3199999999997s)]
*  I can't wait to see how he grows. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2247.56s)]
*  Let's say they got that Maxey deal [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2250.6s)]
*  or whoever the small guard is. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2252.3599999999997s)]
*  Castle can be your Iguodala type to Stephen Curry. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2254.68s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2258.44s)]
*  He does everything for your team. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2259.2799999999997s)]
*  He can defend every position, cut, spot up, screen, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2261.2s)]
*  sometimes run, pick and roll, handle the offense for you. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2265.04s)]
*  Castle's just a total true Swiss Army knife for that roster. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2267.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't know, I love him. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2272.0s)]
*  He's perfect with Victor, perfect for the Spurs. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2272.96s)]
*  They're going to look out at some point [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2275.68s)]
*  there's going to be a team going sideways [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2277.08s)]
*  that wants to rebuild and trades their expensive point guard. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2279.52s)]
*  You know, three weeks ago, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2283.44s)]
*  you could have said maybe it's Sacramento, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2285.0400000000004s)]
*  but they kind of readed the ship a little bit. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2286.5600000000004s)]
*  But at some point, there's going to be somebody [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2288.32s)]
*  with some leverage and a team that is ready to blow it up. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2290.6800000000003s)]
*  Anyway, that trade's never happening, so don't aggregate it. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2295.0800000000004s)]
*  Did you have a fake trade that's never happening, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2298.96s)]
*  but you still were enchanted by it? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2301.0400000000004s)]
*  Let's see on my list. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2303.84s)]
*  I mean, I think most of mine, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2306.5600000000004s)]
*  maybe you could say there's a chance. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2308.5600000000004s)]
*  So none of them, I would say are super crazy. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2310.1200000000003s)]
*  Put them in the you're saying a chance. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2312.28s)]
*  All right, let's move into trades we could actually see happening, [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2313.6000000000004s)]
*  even though if they probably won, I'll get you. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2317.6000000000004s)]
*  What's your first one? [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2319.2400000000002s)]
*  All right, first one, Orlando Magic, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2320.44s)]
*  Anthony Simons to the Magic for Cole Anthony, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2322.6000000000004s)]
*  Jett Howard and one first round pick going to the Blazers. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2325.5600000000004s)]
*  So you upgrade over Cole Anthony with Anthony Simons, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2329.32s)]
*  younger guy as well that still fits the roster for you moving forward in Orlando. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2332.0800000000004s)]
*  And Portland gets Jett Howard. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2338.1600000000003s)]
*  Maybe he turns into something, a future pick. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2339.88s)]
*  And they get some salary relief as well, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2342.28s)]
*  since you're going to have Cole Anthony, Jett Howard in pieces [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2345.1600000000003s)]
*  rather than that big Simon's deal in the 25 million dollar range. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2347.96s)]
*  And Simon's has some Orlando connections, I think. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2351.92s)]
*  Yes, he's from Florida. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2354.5600000000004s)]
*  There's always he's always been rumored in as a possible magic thing. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2356.1600000000003s)]
*  And for Portland, it's all like an all in. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2360.76s)]
*  You know, let's get a full look at Scoot. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2362.84s)]
*  Scoot's been better as of late. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2365.0400000000004s)]
*  He's shown signs of life. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2366.52s)]
*  So that's part of it. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2368.32s)]
*  That's part of the signs of life. All right. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2370.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, there's been life. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2371.88s)]
*  That's part of it for Portland here. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2373.44s)]
*  It's like you have Simon's who's taking a lot of those touches. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2375.0s)]
*  He's absorbing a lot of those minutes. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2377.7200000000003s)]
*  Cole Anthony, great chemistry chemistry guy for the magic. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2379.7200000000003s)]
*  That's one reason why you wouldn't want to move him. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2382.84s)]
*  But he can be that in Portland, too. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2384.8s)]
*  He could be the backup spark plug point guard. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2386.52s)]
*  Simon's is actually deserving of a bigger role. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2388.8s)]
*  So I think he could get that with the magic that he can't get with Portland [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2391.2400000000002s)]
*  because you still need to invest in Scoot if you're the Blazers, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2394.4s)]
*  despite all the ups and downs. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2397.32s)]
*  I think what we've seen the last five, six games, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2399.56s)]
*  which I've been monitoring very closely with the much. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2402.2s)]
*  And plus the billups quotes to bill up seems like really fired up about him [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2404.48s)]
*  all of a sudden. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2408.7599999999998s)]
*  But stuff's clicking. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2409.88s)]
*  Things are happening. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2411.36s)]
*  They're starting to move the team toward him. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2412.24s)]
*  They're also in the tanking situation. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2414.44s)]
*  So it's perfect. Just let him make his mistakes. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2416.64s)]
*  But I'm with you. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2418.7999999999997s)]
*  They probably Simon's probably needs to go for the scoop piece. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2420.08s)]
*  I don't know what he's worth. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2424.24s)]
*  So if you're saying like Orlando gives up a first, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2426.12s)]
*  that's going to be a bottom half of the first round first, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2428.28s)]
*  unless it's this year's draft because their record isn't nearly as good [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2430.84s)]
*  as it would have been because of all the injuries. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2435.88s)]
*  So they have they own their own first the next six years. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2437.4s)]
*  I would probably want this year's first from them if I traded Simon. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2441.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I think so, too. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2444.48s)]
*  Going forward, they're probably going to be. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2445.84s)]
*  The top eight or nine team. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2448.6400000000003s)]
*  So all right, that's a fun one. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2450.2400000000002s)]
*  My first one. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2452.88s)]
*  I want to get Cam Johnson, who's been floated around a lot. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2455.36s)]
*  Brooklyn clearly wants to trade him. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2458.36s)]
*  I've decided Detroit should be the team that gets him. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2460.12s)]
*  And Detroit has the Tim Hardaway expiring. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2463.84s)]
*  They have a weird situation with their pick because New York owns their pick. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2467.0s)]
*  So it's like protected and it just keeps rolling over. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2471.28s)]
*  But then you can't trade 2025 or 26 because eventually to be realized in 27. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2474.12s)]
*  So I was thinking, I wonder how the Knicks would help them out. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2479.36s)]
*  And remove the protections from the pick so that Detroit could trade this year's [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2482.48s)]
*  pick, try to get Cam Johnson and maybe the other next pick. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2486.6s)]
*  Then I started thinking, you don't see teams do this as much, but what if [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2490.0s)]
*  the next trade of Mitchell Robinson to Detroit is part of the deal? [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2494.44s)]
*  And as part of the deal, they got this giant trade exception [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2499.0s)]
*  and they forfeited their rights to the Detroit first, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2503.72s)]
*  and they got Dayron Sharp back from from the Nets. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2508.2s)]
*  And they just got a backup center making $10 million less than Robinson. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2511.88s)]
*  And then the Nets will be like, we'll give you the Angela Russell too. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2516.68s)]
*  He's available in the next year. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2519.04s)]
*  Go no thanks. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2520.08s)]
*  But is there something there where it could be a three team or not a two, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2520.84s)]
*  the Knicks could get something out of it, cut some salary, create an exception. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2525.56s)]
*  Maybe it's just Cam Johnson for Tim Hardaway in a pick and it's a later pick. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2529.2s)]
*  But do you, is there something there? [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2533.7599999999998s)]
*  Cause I feel like there is, I would like the Pistons. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2535.2s)]
*  I want to see them get better. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2537.4s)]
*  I mean, it's complicated. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2538.36s)]
*  So like I would, I'm just trying to figure out the salaries here. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2542.56s)]
*  So Mitchell Robinson, to be clear, he's going to 14 million. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2546.56s)]
*  Detroit could actually take it because to Detroit, because they're [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2551.1200000000003s)]
*  way under the cap, right? [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2555.6800000000003s)]
*  No, they have the cap. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2558.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2559.1600000000003s)]
*  Well, if they're taking Cam Johnson, they won't be under the cap though. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2559.36s)]
*  I did it in the trade machine and it all worked because there's trade [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2563.2000000000003s)]
*  exception stuff too. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2567.28s)]
*  Anyway, it could just be Cam Johnson and Hardaway in a pack and we make, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2568.2s)]
*  we could make it easier because that works too. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2572.64s)]
*  Um, but I mean, I'm intrigued. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2574.9199999999996s)]
*  I mean, the, regardless of the surrounding pieces, the idea of Cam [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2577.3999999999996s)]
*  Johnson on the Pistons makes a lot of sense. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2581.48s)]
*  I mean, as a better Tim Hardaway, yes, that's the type of guy they [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2584.2799999999997s)]
*  should be going for, for sure. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2587.4399999999996s)]
*  Um, like if it's a, if it's an easier deal to make than, than maybe, but like, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2589.2s)]
*  I don't know about all the other pieces, but Cam Johnson, the Pistons. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2593.0s)]
*  Yes, please. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2595.3599999999997s)]
*  Like that's a good idea. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2596.2s)]
*  I made it too complicated, but yes, I think simply that idea I like. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2597.3599999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2601.7999999999997s)]
*  I, if I were the Knicks, I'd be thinking of a way to dump Mitchell Robinson in a [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2602.7599999999998s)]
*  trade and get a cheaper big back and try to get some cap space, some apron relief, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2606.52s)]
*  some luxury tax relief and some flexibility with some sort of trade exception [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2611.2799999999997s)]
*  would be my dream scenario. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2615.7599999999998s)]
*  I have a Mitchell Robinson trade in part for that. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2617.12s)]
*  Let's hear it. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2619.4399999999996s)]
*  I got the Knicks in the jazz. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2620.52s)]
*  I had Mitchell Robinson, Deuce McBride, who had pained me to trade and [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2623.08s)]
*  precious to Chua for Colin Sexton, Walker Kessler and a salary filler [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2627.04s)]
*  in his feed by Kailuk. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2631.88s)]
*  So in this case, you'd be, you'd, you would do this deal if you're the [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2633.32s)]
*  Knicks knowing that Mitchell Robinson may not be coming back for the entire season. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2637.4s)]
*  And so you get Walker Kessler back to fill a similar role. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2641.2799999999997s)]
*  You get Colin Sexton as an upgrade over Deuce McBride. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2644.24s)]
*  I love Deuce. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2647.4s)]
*  I think Deuce is better than Tom Thibodeau. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2648.32s)]
*  I mean, Tom Thibodeau barely plays him though. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2650.96s)]
*  He barely plays any of the guys off the bench. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2653.08s)]
*  So maybe you don't even make this deal for that reason, knowing Tibbs is going [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2655.52s)]
*  to have Walker Kessler playing eight minutes a game and Sexton playing 15. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2658.88s)]
*  But, but maybe he would play some of those guys more. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2663.72s)]
*  But so I think if you're the Knicks something along those lines, I'd be [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2666.64s)]
*  wanting to get another center because as much as I really like precious to Chua, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2670.3599999999997s)]
*  I want a true five. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2674.16s)]
*  I want another true rim protector next to Kat, because what they've been doing [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2675.4s)]
*  lately in the lineups have worked well, but they've barely played Kat with a Chua. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2679.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2684.7200000000003s)]
*  It's worked when they have, it's been really successful for that team, but I [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2684.96s)]
*  want to see somebody that allows Kat to be in that role he was next to go bear [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2688.12s)]
*  in Minnesota and now a Chua doesn't offer the rim protection that say Walker [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2692.08s)]
*  Kessler could, so maybe I've made that deal too complicated and you trim it down. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2696.4s)]
*  No, I see what you're trying to do with it though. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2700.88s)]
*  I just, if I'm Utah, why do I have to trade Kessler if I'm Utah is what I [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2702.8s)]
*  keep coming back to every time I see his name and trade rumors. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2708.64s)]
*  I mean, that's, that's the case with a lot of guys. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2712.08s)]
*  Like why I'm sure you do want him. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2714.24s)]
*  He's a young guy and a super cheap contract and, and he produces and he [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2716.64s)]
*  protects the rim. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2720.7999999999997s)]
*  Why do I have to trade them? [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2721.6s)]
*  Like they're probably, I would assume they're going to try to be good next [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2723.24s)]
*  year or try to be better. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2725.92s)]
*  How many years in a row can you throw away? [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2727.52s)]
*  Yeah, there's something there. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2729.92s)]
*  I think the Knicks have to think that way. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2730.7599999999998s)]
*  How can they package? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2732.4s)]
*  They get to go get BYU's AJ Devonsa one more year of being crappy. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2735.0s)]
*  Oh, you think they're throwing away another one. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2739.92s)]
*  One more year. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2742.08s)]
*  Just one more. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2743.52s)]
*  If you're the jazz, that's also next year's class has more than just AJ too. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2744.52s)]
*  The next year's class, you get the boosers, you got Kareem Lopez, who's [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2750.16s)]
*  dominating in the NBL right now as 17 years old in a men's league. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2753.6s)]
*  So there's a lot of guys in next year's class that could be, you know, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2758.08s)]
*  a number one quality pick. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2761.92s)]
*  So I think it's one more year for Utah. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2763.2s)]
*  What, where's the Bantza and the Brooklyn and the Brockton rankings right now? [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2765.8s)]
*  It's got to be number one. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2770.16s)]
*  No, Haggar's got to be one, right? [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2771.44s)]
*  Oh, I mean, right today, like currently. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2773.16s)]
*  All time. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2775.56s)]
*  It's rising. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2776.7599999999998s)]
*  All time. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2780.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2780.68s)]
*  Devonsa is going to prove it. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2781.04s)]
*  Is it Rocky Marciano from Brooklyn or Brockton? [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2782.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2784.7599999999998s)]
*  Over my shoulder, these two bobbleheads. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2785.08s)]
*  I got Marvin Haggar and Rocky Marciano. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2787.0s)]
*  So Marciano and Haggar are one, two. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2788.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2789.48s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2790.08s)]
*  All time. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2790.2s)]
*  Yeah, they're one, two without a doubt. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2790.92s)]
*  What if San Antonio traded for Jordan Poole and Jonas Valanchinis and gave up [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2792.72s)]
*  Jones and Collins in a first round pick? [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2799.84s)]
*  And kind of dabbled in getting better, but didn't really do it and [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2803.96s)]
*  didn't really give up anything. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2807.8s)]
*  And if you're Washington, you're like, this is great. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2809.6s)]
*  Now we got rid of the one guy who can actually win games for us. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2811.52s)]
*  Um, we got rid of a center that keeps getting mentioned in these trades. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2815.48s)]
*  We, we know what happens with these centers. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2819.72s)]
*  They always end up going for second round picks. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2821.64s)]
*  Nobody gives up a first round pick for the $9 million. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2823.16s)]
*  Pretty good center. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2826.2799999999997s)]
*  Um, but if you're San Antonio and you could add just Jordan Poole [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2827.68s)]
*  and Valanchinis for nothing. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2831.32s)]
*  Like basically nothing. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2833.7599999999998s)]
*  Why wouldn't you do that? [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2834.92s)]
*  So a Jordan Poole bill. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2837.04s)]
*  Yeah, let's hear it. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2838.7599999999998s)]
*  Throughout, throughout his entire basketball life, he's been a near [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2839.4s)]
*  90% guy from the free throw line. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2844.12s)]
*  He's had touch near the basket on floaters, but he's never been a [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2846.2s)]
*  consistent three point shooter until this season, 25 years old, over 40% [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2850.6s)]
*  from three for the first time in his entire career after he was a below 34% guy. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2856.08s)]
*  What if this is the new Jordan Poole? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2861.4399999999996s)]
*  What if, what if you figure it out? [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2863.7599999999998s)]
*  2022 finals, Jordan Poole is really Jordan Poole and Draymond Green just [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2864.8799999999997s)]
*  punched it out of him for two years. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2870.24s)]
*  I think he's worth taking our it's this year and the next two on his contract. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2872.12s)]
*  He's overpaid. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2876.08s)]
*  There's no question, but if you're San Antonio, what do you care? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2877.52s)]
*  You're not spending that much money anyway. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2879.7999999999997s)]
*  And for Poole, like it's not like, uh, you have him till he's 27, 28 years old. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2882.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2886.6s)]
*  So it's not a long-term, legitimately good this year. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2886.8799999999997s)]
*  I actually like watching him on the Wizards this year. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2890.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2892.48s)]
*  I know the Wizards went from one of the worst watches in the league last year too. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2892.76s)]
*  Oh, wait a minute. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2896.32s)]
*  They're pretty fun. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2896.84s)]
*  There's this some like Poole's been really good. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2897.52s)]
*  Alex, Sara's getting better. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2899.48s)]
*  They've been a fun team to watch. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2901.36s)]
*  Well, you can tell who's not watching the Wizards when people are like, what [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2902.92s)]
*  if they can get Kyle Kuzma? [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2905.7200000000003s)]
*  And it's like, you have to say, I haven't watched a Wizards game this year. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2907.0800000000004s)]
*  He's been one of the worst players of the league. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2909.6800000000003s)]
*  Nobody wants Kyle Kuzma. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2911.6400000000003s)]
*  Kuzma has not been good, but Poole, I'm intrigued. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2913.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm intrigued. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2916.2000000000003s)]
*  Cause for a long time. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2916.76s)]
*  That's fun. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2917.76s)]
*  So you like this one. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2918.0s)]
*  This might be the first one we've fully agreed on. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2919.08s)]
*  I like this one because Poole is the type of guy that I think is worth a swing. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2921.52s)]
*  Like for the, for the Spurs, these guys, I don't want to get, when they first [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2924.8s)]
*  drafted Wemby Bill, I was thinking, oh, they should accelerate. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2930.6s)]
*  They should go after Brook Lopez and have another big, they should go after a [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2934.16s)]
*  veteran and really support Victor and be good right away. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2937.16s)]
*  I've backed off that the last year and a half. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2940.6800000000003s)]
*  I want them instead to take these short term guys who are swings. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2943.84s)]
*  I'd be open to Zion Jordan pool types, guys like that who help you be competitive, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2948.4s)]
*  but you're not having to overspend all of your future rascals. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2954.68s)]
*  Cause the time you're going to be really wanting to trade in those assets, like [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2957.56s)]
*  the two future picks you got from Minnesota, the picks you have from the Hawks. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2961.12s)]
*  That's going to be in the next two, three, four years. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2964.88s)]
*  And that range when Victor's into his mid twenties, that's when it's time to go [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2967.7999999999997s)]
*  build and try to go forward and take those really big swings on proven guys. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2971.72s)]
*  I still think you want to be, but I still think you want to be competitive in a [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2976.48s)]
*  real way now, which is what Preston did with OKC the last couple of years, right? [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2980.2s)]
*  He, he, and just because he lucked out in a bunch of different ways, but his [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2983.96s)]
*  scale as a GM, but also like guys blossoming, maybe faster than he thought. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2990.36s)]
*  But all that stuff was good for them. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2994.48s)]
*  Those, those games that OKC played the last two years led to this year. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2995.7599999999998s)]
*  I think if you're San Antonio, you want to start thinking that way. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=2999.7599999999998s)]
*  Totally. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3002.4s)]
*  Can this year and next year lead to two years from now? [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3002.72s)]
*  We're a 60 win team. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3005.3999999999996s)]
*  And they are competitive. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3007.2s)]
*  They're just slightly below 500. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3008.3599999999997s)]
*  They're really great when Victor's on the floor. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3010.04s)]
*  So they're tough at the end of games. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3012.72s)]
*  They, they have the same problem Houston has where it's, you know, if he's not [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3014.12s)]
*  getting the ball in the right spots, it's really, or Vasell is really the only [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3018.6s)]
*  other one I kind of trust with the ball. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3022.8399999999997s)]
*  He's too old now. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3024.8399999999997s)]
*  And Vasell has been disappointing this season. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3026.24s)]
*  No, he has, but I mean, I, at least I feel like he can get the shot that he wants. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3027.8799999999997s)]
*  I don't know if it's going in, but it's really hard for them to create [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3031.04s)]
*  offense down the stretch and Jordan pool. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3033.84s)]
*  No issues creating Jordan pool. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3036.52s)]
*  No issues. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3038.12s)]
*  I was. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3038.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3039.28s)]
*  So we're aligned on that one. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3039.68s)]
*  I would love to see them do. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3040.72s)]
*  I like it. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3041.72s)]
*  I'm into it. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3042.28s)]
*  That's a good creative idea. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3042.8s)]
*  I hadn't thought about Jordan pool as a target for the, for the Spurs. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3043.96s)]
*  That's a good one. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3046.48s)]
*  Do your Zion one. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3047.48s)]
*  You must have a Zion to the Spurs one. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3048.44s)]
*  I don't, I don't have a Zion to the Spurs one. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3050.04s)]
*  I was just intrigued by the idea after you mentioned the Pelican strides. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3052.44s)]
*  I'm all, I'm all in. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3055.44s)]
*  I mean, there's multiple ways that could go. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3056.72s)]
*  I don't know how many picks would have to be involved, but I think putting Zion, [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3058.32s)]
*  I talked about this a couple of weeks ago, rolling the dice with Zion with that team. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3061.32s)]
*  With the spotlight of being Wemby's teammate, different organization, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3066.92s)]
*  a lot of history titles, Tim Duncan sitting in their court side every once in a while. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3070.4s)]
*  I would just do it. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3074.48s)]
*  Can I give you a three way of just kind of, it's like a Yankee swap and Christmas. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3076.32s)]
*  Sure. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3082.92s)]
*  Milwaukee gets Tobias Harris making $25.3 million this year on, on the books for next year too. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3083.28s)]
*  Minnesota gets Chris Middleton, 31.7 million. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3090.4s)]
*  Detroit gets Julius Randall, 33.1 million. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3093.88s)]
*  This actually works in the trade machine. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3096.8s)]
*  So Detroit's taking almost $8 million extra salary to quote unquote upgrade from Harris [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3099.2400000000002s)]
*  to Randall, maybe for this year, maybe this year and next year, if he opts in. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3106.36s)]
*  Minnesota saving a little money and getting rid of the Julius Randall issue. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3109.7599999999998s)]
*  That's kind of haunted them all season, even though I think he's a good basketball [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3112.8399999999997s)]
*  player, just doesn't make sense for them. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3115.8399999999997s)]
*  So they would say 1.6 million, which with the tax becomes like 20 million or some crazy [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3117.9599999999996s)]
*  number and just kind of people passing stuff around. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3123.12s)]
*  Kind of like it. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3127.9599999999996s)]
*  And Milwaukee saving money. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3128.9599999999996s)]
*  But I kind of liked the idea of Randall on Detroit. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3131.16s)]
*  Cause even Monday, everyone was going nuts about Kate. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3133.16s)]
*  Kate had 10 turnovers and I was like, I'm going to go to the next one. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3135.64s)]
*  Kate had 10 turnovers in that game. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3138.44s)]
*  He has the ball all the time. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3140.5600000000004s)]
*  You know, he kind of needs one more person. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3142.1200000000003s)]
*  You know, I don't want Randall on Detroit. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3144.76s)]
*  So you don't want Randall anywhere. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3147.92s)]
*  Is there a team you want Randall? [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3149.1200000000003s)]
*  Brooklyn. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3152.1200000000003s)]
*  So you think he's become a good stats, bad team guy? [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3153.92s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's exactly what he is. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3156.4s)]
*  I mean, it's crazy to say that about a dude who was two time all NBA and he's had some [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3158.32s)]
*  really good seasons, but he's just been horrible for Minnesota this year. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3163.1200000000003s)]
*  And he's also had times where it was horrible for the Knicks. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3167.6s)]
*  And so you have this really good thing going right now with the Pistons. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3170.28s)]
*  And I know Kate's not perfect yet, but I don't want Randall clog in the lane for [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3173.04s)]
*  Kate when things are finally opening up for him and he's looking like a borderline [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3177.4s)]
*  all NBA guy. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3182.08s)]
*  But why do you like it for the other teams though? [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3183.32s)]
*  I'm just curious. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3184.8s)]
*  Um, I like saving money if I'm Milwaukee and I like saving a little money if I'm [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3186.32s)]
*  Minnesota and getting rid of the Randall piece and for Detroit, I think the bet [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3190.88s)]
*  would just be Randall was 24 and 10 and was an all NBA forward, you know, a [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3194.88s)]
*  couple of times for the Knicks and got put in one of the worst possible situations [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3200.96s)]
*  in Minnesota for him as a basketball player, where it just doesn't make sense. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3206.1600000000003s)]
*  Maybe there's an actual asset here. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3210.1600000000003s)]
*  Or is that in part his fault that it's not working perfectly? [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3212.6400000000003s)]
*  Oh, it's definitely partly his fault because he doesn't know how to play any [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3216.84s)]
*  other way, but that that's the thing. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3219.44s)]
*  It's like, well, maybe on a different team, there's something more here. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3221.12s)]
*  I would think about it, but I also think that Troy probably has better moves. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3226.0s)]
*  Like I like cam Johnson for them more than Randall, but I, Randall's not, to [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3229.7599999999998s)]
*  me, he's not a sunk cost. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3235.36s)]
*  Like Beal is a sunk cost to me. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3236.6s)]
*  I don't see a scenario where he's worth that money ever again. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3238.64s)]
*  Randall, I'm not positive. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3241.72s)]
*  So I, I'm sure you do too. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3243.96s)]
*  I know some Knicks fans who still swear by Randall and we're like, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3245.92s)]
*  guys getting a bad rap. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3249.36s)]
*  He was really good for us. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3250.96s)]
*  I read those people are out there. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3252.88s)]
*  Then there's other Knicks fans who can't stand him. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3253.96s)]
*  Give me a trade. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3256.08s)]
*  All right. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3257.84s)]
*  I got a small one. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3258.04s)]
*  This is a son's one. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3259.4s)]
*  You serve Nurkic and one of the first you got in that Utah deal to the [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3260.84s)]
*  Blazers for Robert Williams. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3264.7200000000003s)]
*  Send her back to Portland's get time Lord, obviously injury prone, but he's a [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3268.48s)]
*  lob guy fits the Nick Richards profile. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3272.6s)]
*  Or he makes way less money than Nurkic. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3275.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3277.7599999999998s)]
*  So you're saving money and you're getting a guy who probably has to throw [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3278.0s)]
*  us something else in there to make this salary work, work salary wise. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3281.6s)]
*  Nurkic for Williams. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3285.16s)]
*  Oh yeah, it does. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3286.16s)]
*  I mean, I would do it just to get off the Nurkic money next year and save the [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3289.96s)]
*  luxury tax Nurkic is, I don't know if he's not the worst contract in the league, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3293.4s)]
*  but when you think about he's one of the most untradable, I think it was [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3297.7999999999997s)]
*  yeah, it was hilarious earlier in the year when the sons fans were thinking [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3302.88s)]
*  that they could turn Nurkic in the Vucevich somehow. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3306.68s)]
*  It's like, what planet are you on? [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3310.48s)]
*  Nurkic has been awful. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3311.7599999999998s)]
*  Nobody wants Nurkic. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3313.0s)]
*  Now they traded for Nick Richards and he doesn't play at all. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3314.12s)]
*  So, um, I would do that for both teams because Nurkic had, the only thing is if [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3317.52s)]
*  you're trading a center, if I'm Portland, do I want to get a center back? [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3324.64s)]
*  Is it worth it just to get a random pick? [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3329.2s)]
*  Is there a way to make that a three-way deal where Nurkic goes somewhere else? [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3331.7599999999998s)]
*  Maybe Nurkic comes off the bench for you behind Klingon, something like that, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3335.16s)]
*  you know, but then you have the Aitin issue as well, but I want to see [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3339.4s)]
*  them go with two bigs sometimes. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3343.96s)]
*  I'd like to see them try that out more often. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3346.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3348.0s)]
*  I think Billups is resistant to doing that, but at least Nurkic is a guy. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3348.48s)]
*  He's, you know, he's a vet. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3352.48s)]
*  Maybe he plays a little bit off the bench for you, but, um, being back in [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3354.44s)]
*  Portland, maybe he won't pout like he is in Phoenix right now. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3358.04s)]
*  Is Aitin a trade piece to you in any way? [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3361.48s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3365.12s)]
*  So he's another one. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3366.96s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3368.0s)]
*  He's been productive, but who's trading for him at 30 plus million dollars. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3369.56s)]
*  So many teams have fives right now. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3373.44s)]
*  I don't think there's many teams out there that would want a five making [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3375.64s)]
*  his money with how inconsistent he is. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3378.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3380.92s)]
*  I don't, I don't know the team. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3381.96s)]
*  Not sure. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3383.6800000000003s)]
*  New Orleans made sense a little bit before the season, but not so much right now. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3384.88s)]
*  Yeah, not like they're 12 and 32. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3388.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3390.6800000000003s)]
*  They're the only team that I really had thought of before the season. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3391.04s)]
*  At this point, I don't see something there for him. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3393.68s)]
*  I have one more big trade. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3396.8799999999997s)]
*  So give me one more from you before I do my big one. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3398.2799999999997s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3401.8799999999997s)]
*  I got, I got one right here. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3402.3999999999996s)]
*  I got a cam Johnson one. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3403.8399999999997s)]
*  I mentioned this on my podcast with Bobby marks earlier in the week [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3405.2799999999997s)]
*  and he was iffy on it. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3408.64s)]
*  So I'm curious about your thoughts cam Johnson to the calves for Isaac [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3410.0s)]
*  O'Coro, rookie Jalen Tyson, the Angs contract and their unprotected 2031. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3414.3199999999997s)]
*  First, Bobby was iffy on it because the calves you could argue, and I think [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3420.04s)]
*  his reason is pretty sound here. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3426.08s)]
*  You could argue the calves should try to get under the luxury tax this year [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3428.08s)]
*  to not get that clock started. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3432.48s)]
*  So you become a team on over the tax multiple years in a row. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3434.72s)]
*  Once mobile has to be reassigned and all these guys deals come up. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3438.24s)]
*  And so Bobby was like, maybe you go the other way and try to trade [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3442.16s)]
*  a guy to get under the tax. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3444.6s)]
*  I think that makes sense. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3445.8s)]
*  At the same time, cam Johnson is very clearly an upgrade over Isaac O'Coro. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3447.0s)]
*  He adds dynamic shooting ability to your team when you're on a 71 pace. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3452.0s)]
*  This could be your chance to go for it. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3456.08s)]
*  This could be the only year who knows what's going to happen in the future. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3457.92s)]
*  So I like the idea of at least going forward this year and trying to roll [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3461.04s)]
*  the dice with somebody like cam Johnson, adding more upside to your team. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3464.44s)]
*  I don't like it. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3470.52s)]
*  And I'll tell you why. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3472.04s)]
*  I think if that team loses in the playoffs, it's going to be because of [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3473.56s)]
*  their inability to guard winks, right? [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3477.28s)]
*  Cam Johnson's not helping me with that. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3480.84s)]
*  So if I'm using my last trade chip and I agree their shootings, great. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3482.7200000000003s)]
*  That w that always helps, but I don't think he's playing crunch time for them [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3487.4s)]
*  because now I have Garland out there and cam Johnson, how, like if I'm playing [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3491.52s)]
*  Tatum and Brown, who's guarding Tatum and Brown if I'm playing those guys together. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3496.6400000000003s)]
*  So I feel like if they, if they're going to do a trade like that and go into the [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3501.4s)]
*  major attacks, I need somebody who can potentially guard Jason Tatum in the last [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3504.96s)]
*  five minutes of a game six in Boston. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3512.0s)]
*  And I don't think it's cam Johnson. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3515.2s)]
*  That would be my count. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3517.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3518.44s)]
*  I don't know who it is though, that you can go get. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3518.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, like Isaac O'Cora was a better defender, but he also is somebody that [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3521.0s)]
*  you're going to be helping off of on defense. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3524.48s)]
*  It's always a push pole with these guys. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3526.24s)]
*  So for the calves, you have limited assets. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3528.88s)]
*  Well, why do they have to do anything? [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3532.12s)]
*  They're playing really well. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3533.48s)]
*  Like, like, I guess that's my other question with them is like, they seem [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3534.6s)]
*  like they all love playing with each other and they're having a great season. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3538.12s)]
*  Like sometimes continuity is the move, right? [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3540.96s)]
*  Yep. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3545.4s)]
*  Sometimes it is. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3546.0s)]
*  And sometimes you regret not trying to add another piece. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3547.04s)]
*  They can go both ways. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3550.4s)]
*  I think it depends. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3551.48s)]
*  I came Johnson's a good guy. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3552.36s)]
*  I think he could fit into any locker room flawlessly. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3553.6400000000003s)]
*  I don't think it'd be an issue. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3556.28s)]
*  Having a great team. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3557.16s)]
*  Yeah, he's been great. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3558.3599999999997s)]
*  So I just think if, if you're talking about like who defends Tatum, who defends [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3559.16s)]
*  Brown, like it's hard to defend those guys, all these great players that level [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3563.24s)]
*  anyway, unless you have a truly. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3568.3999999999996s)]
*  Maybe it's easy to friend Jaylen Brown lately. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3570.3199999999997s)]
*  Right now it is. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3572.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3573.56s)]
*  What? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3573.7999999999997s)]
*  Hey, he's going to try that follow away again for the foul line. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3573.96s)]
*  That'd be great. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3576.3199999999997s)]
*  Try that one more time. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3577.08s)]
*  Drive to the middle of the floor with your left hand again. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3578.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3580.24s)]
*  But I think for the calves, if you're talking about that matchup issue, I mean, [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3580.92s)]
*  you do have Dean Wade who's been really good defensively for you. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3585.56s)]
*  But even then Dean Wade alone isn't stopping those guys. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3588.8s)]
*  It's having Evan Mobley shade over and help. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3592.0s)]
*  It's having Jared Allen presence at the basket. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3594.36s)]
*  It's Donovan Mitchell helping at the nail and shading help over. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3597.32s)]
*  Like it's a more than one guy. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3600.48s)]
*  So I don't think Cam Johnson, some liability by any means, he's just an average [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3602.52s)]
*  defender, but he's definitely somebody they would pick on compared to the others. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3606.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3610.08s)]
*  By the way, if you're picking on anybody, like if it's an end game lineup, it's [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3610.2s)]
*  Garland. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3613.56s)]
*  It's Garland still. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3614.04s)]
*  No, now I have two guys I can pick on. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3615.36s)]
*  I'm using Cam Johnson's guy to set the screen for Garland and it's like a feast. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3617.96s)]
*  Now. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3622.44s)]
*  Could be. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3623.72s)]
*  It's an interesting one because on the other hand, you could say, well, we're [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3624.4s)]
*  just going to outscore everybody. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3627.4s)]
*  Now we have Cam Johnson. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3628.56s)]
*  We're scoring 120 points a game and we'll, we'll figure out how to get some stops. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3629.64s)]
*  I'd be really scared to do that much if I was Cleveland, cause it seems like one [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3634.24s)]
*  of the few teams we have right now that actually really likes playing with each [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3637.84s)]
*  other, right? [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3640.68s)]
*  How many teams, when you watch these games, how many teams actually seem like [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3642.08s)]
*  they all like each other? [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3645.1200000000003s)]
*  It's less than five. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3646.4s)]
*  Okay. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3647.6400000000003s)]
*  See, okay. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3647.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3648.6800000000003s)]
*  See, they're the number one version of that Cleveland. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3648.96s)]
*  I mean, obviously one and two, what both one seeds that they have Boston really [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3652.0s)]
*  likes each other, even though they're not playing that well, I'd put them on that [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3655.88s)]
*  list. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3658.56s)]
*  They're just bored. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3658.92s)]
*  I think Boston's bored right now. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3659.88s)]
*  No question. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3661.52s)]
*  Do you have another one? [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3663.2000000000003s)]
*  Cause I have one big one. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3663.96s)]
*  Is there another one you want to throw? [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3665.88s)]
*  Uh, go with your big one. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3667.04s)]
*  You ready for the big one? [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3668.7200000000003s)]
*  I got my, I got my favorite ones out. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3669.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3671.2400000000002s)]
*  It's an Anthony Davis trade. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3672.1200000000003s)]
*  And the thinking is we've gone as far as we can go. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3675.2000000000003s)]
*  We've done everything we could for you, LeBron. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3679.04s)]
*  You've been here since 2018. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3682.2400000000002s)]
*  We won a title together. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3684.7200000000003s)]
*  We went, got your guy, Anthony Davis. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3686.08s)]
*  We drafted your son and gave them a no cut contract. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3688.36s)]
*  Um, every time you've pushed us to do something, we've done it, including the [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3691.76s)]
*  Russell Westbrook trade, which you were hands off after that happened. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3695.2400000000002s)]
*  We've taken this as far as we can go, and we're not going to mortgage anymore [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3698.72s)]
*  the future for this because for the first time ever, the Quippers have a [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3702.68s)]
*  better arena than us and probably a better team. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3707.24s)]
*  And there's something cool happening with them and there's nothing cool [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3711.16s)]
*  happening with us. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3714.08s)]
*  And we're not going to be held hostage by this anymore. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3715.08s)]
*  The story in sports decades after decades is people trying to appease [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3717.4399999999996s)]
*  aging superstars. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3722.16s)]
*  It never ends well. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3723.3199999999997s)]
*  We're not going to do it. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3724.2799999999997s)]
*  We're going to zag the other way. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3725.08s)]
*  We're going to trade Anthony Davis to the Golden State Warriors. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3726.6s)]
*  Oh man. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3729.72s)]
*  And we're going to get back your buddy, Draymond Green, Schroeder's expiring [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3731.84s)]
*  Kaminga, Jackson Davis, Golden States 25 and 27 first, and a 20, 2029 pick [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3736.52s)]
*  swap. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3745.56s)]
*  That's LA's call. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3746.12s)]
*  We're cashing in. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3748.2799999999997s)]
*  What do you think? [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3749.68s)]
*  Are you sure this is the Lakers going the other way? [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3751.6s)]
*  Draymond's still a really good defender. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3753.9199999999996s)]
*  It's a pretty good trade. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3755.56s)]
*  They're getting Draymond, Schroeder, Kaminga. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3757.2799999999997s)]
*  They get to roll dice with them. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3760.48s)]
*  Jackson Davis. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3761.52s)]
*  And if you're the Warriors, you still have enough left and you're going to [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3762.2799999999997s)]
*  build around Davis and Curry going down the stretch and you could probably get [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3765.4399999999996s)]
*  creative with some other moves. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3768.48s)]
*  It's kind of fun. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3770.48s)]
*  I don't think the Warriors did. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3771.8399999999997s)]
*  They're going to be a great team. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3773.16s)]
*  They're going to be a great team. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3774.2799999999997s)]
*  They're going to be a great team. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3775.2799999999997s)]
*  They're going to be a great team. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3776.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't think the Warriors do it, but I'm intrigued. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3778.1200000000003s)]
*  Too many picks. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3781.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3783.6400000000003s)]
*  Too many picks and. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3784.8s)]
*  All right. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3786.2000000000003s)]
*  So let's just say that this year's number one, which would be in the middle of [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3786.44s)]
*  the draft and a 27 unprotected first. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3789.6400000000003s)]
*  So now I don't think the Lakers do it now. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3793.6800000000003s)]
*  You think Steph would break out? [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3797.0s)]
*  Let's say the Warriors are in a position there. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3798.1200000000003s)]
*  No to blowing it up. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3800.36s)]
*  No to, you know, trading Steph and Draymond this summer. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3801.5600000000004s)]
*  Right? [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3804.84s)]
*  Let's just say they're not going to do that. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3805.0800000000004s)]
*  Do you think Steph would be willing to break up with Draymond in the scenario? [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3807.04s)]
*  I think the only team that you could talk yourself into this being a realistic [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3810.52s)]
*  scenario is the Lakers because Draymond gets to live in Los Angeles and play with Lebron. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3816.3199999999997s)]
*  Draymond might want it to happen. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3821.44s)]
*  Draymond might be like, this sounds great. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3823.2s)]
*  I've always wanted to be on the Lakers. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3825.16s)]
*  Let's, let's do it. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3827.04s)]
*  Um, I also think it's way harder to find an Anthony Davis trade that makes sense [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3828.6s)]
*  than people realize, cause I see, I have people in my life, it's time to trade [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3832.8799999999997s)]
*  Davis. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3836.4s)]
*  It's like where, like you're not trading me Houston. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3836.84s)]
*  They can't even trade Shen Goon this year. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3839.8s)]
*  Like it would have to be like this summer. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3841.8s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3843.4s)]
*  And at that point, Lebron's 41 and you know, people probably know you go around [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3843.7200000000003s)]
*  the league, you would have said in the past, oh, that maybe they get Carl Anthony [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3848.76s)]
*  Towns and some picks for him, but Carl Anthony Towns is playing great. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3852.52s)]
*  You know, and you go around the league. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3855.96s)]
*  I think it's really hard to find the right trade for him that he'd be excited [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3857.7200000000003s)]
*  about to put him on a team that could actually win a title. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3861.08s)]
*  Like could it be Oklahoma city? [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3864.08s)]
*  No. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3865.64s)]
*  They're not mortgaging everything for, for Davis when they have Shays big [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3866.08s)]
*  contract coming up and they got to pay Jalen Williams soon. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3870.72s)]
*  They're going to have to play Chet Holmgren soon. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3873.0s)]
*  Like, and they're not trading Chet for him. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3874.6s)]
*  So you go through all the teams and I think it's way harder to figure. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3876.4s)]
*  I even was like, Oh, Orlando will be a good one. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3879.6s)]
*  Go look at their contracts. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3882.36s)]
*  What's the Orlando trade? [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3883.7999999999997s)]
*  They can barely even match all the contracts to get to where AD is. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3884.88s)]
*  So I go and say it was the only one that made sense. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3888.44s)]
*  Orlando's interesting though. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3891.88s)]
*  If they were to give Isaac, who's like 24 million, I'm doing this [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3893.32s)]
*  doing this on top of my Cole Anthony. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3897.0s)]
*  He's like 12 and then, [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3898.8s)]
*  right. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3900.6000000000004s)]
*  So I see maybe in the trade. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3901.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3902.6400000000003s)]
*  Maybe that gets you there. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3903.4s)]
*  Orlando would be interesting too. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3904.36s)]
*  I, the problem is like the way the league is now with the, with these [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3906.32s)]
*  different rules, it's really hard to make like a five for one, right? [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3909.88s)]
*  You need that one. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3913.0800000000004s)]
*  Awesome. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3914.6800000000003s)]
*  $28 million contract that you can put in a trade like that. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3915.36s)]
*  And they just don't have it. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3918.48s)]
*  So they could put, you know, they could put, you said, [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3920.0s)]
*  what'd you say, Cole Anthony? [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3923.12s)]
*  Something like that. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3925.2s)]
*  I'm pulling up a trade machine right now. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3926.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3928.08s)]
*  I'm looking at spot track. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3928.2799999999997s)]
*  Isaac at 25, Anthony at 12.9 and then Jet Howard. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3930.0s)]
*  I think Caldwell Pope would have to be in it. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3935.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3939.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm not, not sure if he has. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3939.6s)]
*  Oh, Isaac makes 25 this year. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3941.12s)]
*  That is pretty high. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3942.64s)]
*  25. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3943.4s)]
*  That's not what I said. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3943.88s)]
*  It would work. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3944.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3945.24s)]
*  80, 80 is 42, $43.2 million. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3945.64s)]
*  And then for Isaac, Anthony and Jet Howard, those guys are. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3950.8399999999997s)]
*  Well, wouldn't Carter have to be in that trade though? [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3955.0s)]
*  No, I mean, it wouldn't have to be like finance wise. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3957.2799999999997s)]
*  He wouldn't have to be like, you, you could put him in there instead [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3960.24s)]
*  of Cole Anthony, potentially, I think. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3962.96s)]
*  Is Saruti on this? [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3964.52s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3965.48s)]
*  You can't, you can't do a Wendell Carter. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3965.7999999999997s)]
*  Can you could do Wendell Carter. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3968.12s)]
*  No, you can't turn around this year. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3970.72s)]
*  Or no, I can't. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3972.24s)]
*  Carter, Carter has a trade description. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3973.04s)]
*  All right. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3975.24s)]
*  80, 80 for Isaac, Anthony and Howard. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3975.68s)]
*  And then like, no, let's put Carter in there. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3978.16s)]
*  I think, I don't know. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3980.08s)]
*  You cannot, you cannot, you can't trade Carter. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3980.96s)]
*  Carter can not be traded the season. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3983.08s)]
*  Cause he had the extension. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3984.52s)]
*  Yes. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3986.0s)]
*  So he can't be traded. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3986.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3987.7599999999998s)]
*  What do you think Saruti? [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3989.6s)]
*  I think about it. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3991.36s)]
*  I mean, I've been one of the, I feel like, I feel like you, when we were in Denver, [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3992.4s)]
*  that we were talking about that, I was like the king of the like, yeah, [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=3998.16s)]
*  Laker should trade AD. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4000.56s)]
*  Like, what's the point? [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4001.52s)]
*  Like get what you can get for him. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4002.3199999999997s)]
*  I never even thought of this as a possibility. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4003.84s)]
*  I mean, it's not really what they need, but just imagine that team. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4005.44s)]
*  Like that could, that has like all time defensive capabilities. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4009.12s)]
*  That would be absurd. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4012.64s)]
*  I mean, just go all in on your identity. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4013.48s)]
*  I'd be a little bit worried about, you know, I don't know. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4015.76s)]
*  He just, the injury concerns and the age profile stuff, but it would be kind of fun. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4018.2000000000003s)]
*  Um, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4022.88s)]
*  so you'd have to do 25, 27, 29 and 31. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4023.48s)]
*  I think you'd have to do four unprotected first, probably throw in the Denver [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4028.08s)]
*  first that you have that's rolls over and then maybe a swap. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4033.2400000000002s)]
*  Like how many, how many picks is that? [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4037.6800000000003s)]
*  KOC? [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4039.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean, you just listed five, six. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4040.52s)]
*  Do you want to give all those picks for AD? [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4043.76s)]
*  I think, I think that's where I say no. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4046.1600000000003s)]
*  I think that's where I say no, because I, you know, is, is the timeline right? [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4047.92s)]
*  Like when in two years, like they're not winning these this year. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4052.48s)]
*  Uh, maybe next year they could be a top three team and see about the health [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4055.6400000000003s)]
*  situation, but like it feels like they're going in completely opposite directions. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4058.92s)]
*  Can I pause button you right now? [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4064.08s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4065.2000000000003s)]
*  You'd have a starting frontline of AD, Palo and Franz. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4066.0800000000004s)]
*  The timeline is like now when all those guys come back, I don't want to play that [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4071.2000000000003s)]
*  team. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4075.04s)]
*  You're right. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4075.84s)]
*  I see that team in a playoff series. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4076.2400000000002s)]
*  The timeline is this year. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4077.6000000000004s)]
*  If you do that, I want to do it. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4078.88s)]
*  If it doesn't work out, you're kind of screwed, right? [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4081.84s)]
*  I want to do it for all those picks. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4085.36s)]
*  I'd be, I'd be cheap there if I'm the magic, like eighties, 31 right now. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4087.84s)]
*  He's got four years left until he's 34, 35 years old, and he's going to be making [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4091.8s)]
*  almost $60 million the next three years. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4097.56s)]
*  KOC. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4099.92s)]
*  This is the part where I remind you that the Knicks traded five first round picks [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4100.360000000001s)]
*  for Mikael Bridges. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4103.84s)]
*  Oh, I know Davis is like the 11th best guy in the league. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4105.320000000001s)]
*  I know that's the bar. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4108.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4110.68s)]
*  I think it has to be five picks. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4110.96s)]
*  I think I'd say no, I think I'm saying wow. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4114.360000000001s)]
*  And just wait for something else to happen. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4116.68s)]
*  Cause you do have, but here, here's the one thing. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4119.32s)]
*  So Rudy, right? [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4121.5599999999995s)]
*  Like what is that next thing? [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4122.36s)]
*  Because you're right. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4124.36s)]
*  But let's say there's a player that anytime a player that becomes available, [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4125.48s)]
*  who's better than AD, it's going to be Utah or the thunder or the Spurs, the [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4128.5599999999995s)]
*  other rockets, the nets, these teams that have more picks and quantity and quality. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4135.92s)]
*  Like the magic, the rockets can trade for it this summer. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4140.5199999999995s)]
*  They were shangha and a bunch of stuff and go get them. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4143.2s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4146.0s)]
*  So all these other teams have more quantity and quality that the magic can't [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4147.5599999999995s)]
*  wait for that top five guys. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4151.04s)]
*  They're jumping the line and grabbing them now. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4153.92s)]
*  Yep. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4156.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4156.48s)]
*  But I'm, I think I'm okay long-term with like, you know, let those guys go big [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4157.24s)]
*  fish hunting and we'll just make moves around the edges and kind of like, [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4162.599999999999s)]
*  cause you got the two guys, you've got the guys that matter, you know, like, [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4165.88s)]
*  uh, I, I, so I don't, I just disagree with you. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4170.4s)]
*  It would be a better case if you were like, I'm not sure we should trade for [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4174.32s)]
*  Anthony Davis, who was super injury prone during the year that Palo and Frans both [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4178.48s)]
*  suffered the exact same injury and Mo Vonder got hurt and Suggs got hurt. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4183.719999999999s)]
*  We do not, we do not want to bring our comments to carbon to Anthony Davis. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4187.88s)]
*  Make sure the obliques are iced up for every game. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4191.08s)]
*  I know. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4193.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4195.08s)]
*  What's Anthony Davis's oblique situation? [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4195.24s)]
*  Is it okay? [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4197.36s)]
*  Gosh. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4198.0s)]
*  He's just, he's like strains it. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4199.28s)]
*  Um, I Orlando is the only other one I went through everybody else. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4202.56s)]
*  I just, you know, there's like Sacramento, if you could do like a sub bonus Davis [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4207.08s)]
*  like that, but I don't know where that gets either team, you know? [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4211.92s)]
*  Um, I think it's like the golden state one. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4215.36s)]
*  It just feels, it feels like that's a, that's a timeline match thing [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4218.6s)]
*  that, that just kind of works out. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4222.04s)]
*  I will say this, that trade I laid out. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4223.16s)]
*  If that actually happened, would be one of the most fun trade [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4225.88s)]
*  moments of the 21st century. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4228.56s)]
*  There's so much going on in that trade in all different directions that we, it [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4230.5599999999995s)]
*  just feels like we would talk about that for 10, 10 straight days. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4235.5599999999995s)]
*  Thanks to Rudy. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4239.679999999999s)]
*  Thanks guys. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4240.799999999999s)]
*  That 81 has me thinking though, I'm because for the Lakers bill, you're right. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4242.719999999999s)]
*  Like I don't think they're gonna necessarily go the other way that you're proposing, [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4247.599999999999s)]
*  but it's something they should at least think about. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4252.16s)]
*  Like this week I made the case writing, like the warriors should blow it up [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4253.879999999999s)]
*  because they're not going anywhere. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4257.2s)]
*  Steph's declining. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4259.08s)]
*  Draymond's declining. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4260.24s)]
*  At least they're showing signs of it this year. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4261.320000000001s)]
*  It reminds me of the, the 2012, 13 Celtics when KG and Pierce was still really good, [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4262.88s)]
*  but, but they clearly were beginning to fall a little bit and they make the [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4268.0s)]
*  deal that leads to Tatum and Brown. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4271.88s)]
*  And so I think the warriors are in that spot where at least the front office [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4273.84s)]
*  and ownership should be thinking about it. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4277.24s)]
*  And for the Lakers, obviously LeBron, I mean, eight LeBron's not the same guy. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4279.24s)]
*  He's just not, he's still a great player, but he's not the same level player. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4283.04s)]
*  And AD who knows when the injuries will start perking back up again. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4286.32s)]
*  So they should think about it. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4289.639999999999s)]
*  I just think that Lakers roster is still worth at least exploring, adding more. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4291.5199999999995s)]
*  But if the magic call up and offer you four firsts and two swaps, you've got to [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4296.639999999999s)]
*  take that meeting and really think hard about it because if you do that, then [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4302.0s)]
*  that opens up your ability to say, Oh, guess what? [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4305.679999999999s)]
*  We are open to LeBron trades. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4308.12s)]
*  And then if you were to get something for LeBron too, suddenly you'd have [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4310.5599999999995s)]
*  the most picks in the NBA and then you're. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4313.16s)]
*  I know, but how many contenders, how many contenders teams that actually have a [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4315.56s)]
*  chance to win the title or a realistic option for a 40 year old guy making [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4319.88s)]
*  50 million a year with no trade clause. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4324.68s)]
*  I can't find a single team. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4326.4400000000005s)]
*  Even if you said like, Oh, Cleveland, he wants to come back home. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4328.080000000001s)]
*  And it's like, if I'm Cleveland, do I want to, that's a pretty like aggressive [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4331.84s)]
*  reshaking of the roster. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4336.88s)]
*  I wouldn't do that. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4338.240000000001s)]
*  I want, I want to do it without LeBron if I'm Cleveland. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4339.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4342.240000000001s)]
*  Well, also like you have such a good thing. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4342.84s)]
*  Now you're bringing somebody who, who, you know, the two generations of guys [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4345.320000000001s)]
*  in the league, like Revere, it's really hard for him to be like, all right, just [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4350.04s)]
*  set some picks and hit a couple of corner threes for us. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4353.68s)]
*  Like he's going to have the ball. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4356.12s)]
*  Um, I don't know what the team is for him. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4357.96s)]
*  So, and I don't, I don't, I don't think he wants to leave LA anyway. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4359.92s)]
*  So it's not realistic. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4362.6s)]
*  Davis as a trade is more realistic to me, but, um, I just don't the Lakers [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4363.72s)]
*  organization. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4369.64s)]
*  I, I don't understand why they cowed out of these guys. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4370.400000000001s)]
*  Maybe the sons for LeBron, somebody like that short flight away from LA [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4373.52s)]
*  instead of Jimmy Butler. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4379.52s)]
*  Now the Lakers are taking Beal. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4380.72s)]
*  Like they don't want, I don't want to turn LeBron into Beal. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4382.280000000001s)]
*  No, thank you. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4385.0s)]
*  Also, like if you're the Lakers and you trade LeBron all of a sudden your [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4386.360000000001s)]
*  games, like if you're going to actually rebuild or you're going to like blow it [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4390.360000000001s)]
*  up or whatever, like, like there is still people go to the games to see LeBron. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4395.04s)]
*  He's one of the greatest players in the history of the league. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4399.68s)]
*  Like that's still a draw and they're still in this mix where they seem [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4401.72s)]
*  relevant people who don't actually watch basketball that much think they're [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4405.16s)]
*  still a contender and there's an illusion of competitiveness that is. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4408.36s)]
*  To me, not real, but you at least have that once you, once you start blowing [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4414.2s)]
*  this up, now you're where you were in the mid 2010s. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4418.88s)]
*  Why is that? [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4421.72s)]
*  Is that because of LeBron not being top two, top three anymore? [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4422.64s)]
*  Is that why, or is that more something about the supporting cast? [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4427.0s)]
*  Like why do you think that is? [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4430.84s)]
*  Wow. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4432.84s)]
*  He's, I mean, he's 40. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4433.08s)]
*  He's not the, not close to being the same guy that he used to be. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4434.320000000001s)]
*  He's still one of the 10 to 15 best guys, 80 you said 11th best or something like that. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4437.6s)]
*  So if you still have two top 15 guys. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4442.4400000000005s)]
*  Defense anymore. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4444.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't understand how anyone could put him in the top 12 to 15 at this point. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4445.200000000001s)]
*  When, so you don't have them up there. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4449.56s)]
*  I don't. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4451.52s)]
*  I don't, I would have them in the top 25, but I think, I think it's really hard to, [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4452.36s)]
*  to beat good teams when you have multiple holes on defense. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4457.76s)]
*  Like they have, I think that's a fair statement. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4462.04s)]
*  Like when they have, they're playing Reeves and connect and LeBron all at the same time. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4464.4s)]
*  It's like, you can't play defense that way. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4469.12s)]
*  So, and I'm not, what position is the perfect position for him? [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4471.88s)]
*  Ideally, right? [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4475.32s)]
*  It's the four. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4476.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4477.56s)]
*  Point. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4477.92s)]
*  And then you have really playing with them. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4478.2s)]
*  Really you want to have perimeter guys and you want shooting, but that would mean [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4481.72s)]
*  LeBron would have to guard bigger guys and rebound more and, and, you know, step up [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4486.32s)]
*  on that and it just doesn't seem like he has enough in the tank to do that anymore. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4491.5199999999995s)]
*  So they're in a weird conundrum of them because he gets his stats. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4495.8s)]
*  You can catch the right night. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4498.639999999999s)]
*  He looks great, but I don't see it night to night. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4499.72s)]
*  And we get to the playoffs. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4502.8s)]
*  It's every other game. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4503.679999999999s)]
*  You know? [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4505.639999999999s)]
*  So if, like, if I was the Lakers advisor, would either of us say like you guys have [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4506.16s)]
*  a chance to make the finals with this team, you're one move away? [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4509.72s)]
*  I don't think they are. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4513.16s)]
*  They're two moves away from at least having a chance. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4514.28s)]
*  Everyone's two moves away. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4517.88s)]
*  But well, that's exactly why it's difficult for them. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4519.2s)]
*  There are two moves away from having a chance. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4522.639999999999s)]
*  And even then they're still not the favorite. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4524.24s)]
*  I'm still not taking them in a series against OKC or Denver. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4526.0s)]
*  I still think they're probably a second round out. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4529.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4532.12s)]
*  Even if they do get Levine, even if they do get Kessler, but you'd have [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4532.36s)]
*  a better shot in that scenario. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4536.08s)]
*  But I still want to pick them for you. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4538.28s)]
*  We need so much luck with you. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4539.88s)]
*  You need an OKC injury. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4541.88s)]
*  You need something weird to happen with. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4543.88s)]
*  You'd have to go down and there would have to be a dumb thing that [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4545.24s)]
*  happened with every team. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4547.72s)]
*  I just think it can happen that like the Warriors had a pretty good path in 2022. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4549.84s)]
*  And like her talked about recently and they they win it all. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4554.96s)]
*  Like it's not impossible to happen. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4558.5599999999995s)]
*  So that's what they know. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4562.0s)]
*  But I do think, you know, if a team calls up for a day, it makes a significant [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4563.24s)]
*  offer, they need to be thinking about that. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4567.44s)]
*  They have to. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4568.92s)]
*  Who do you have in the finals right now? [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4570.8s)]
*  Still OKC in the West. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4573.2s)]
*  No Denver really intrigues me. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4574.52s)]
*  Just the way they're playing lately, like we talked about earlier with Ross [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4576.28s)]
*  stepping up and everything. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4579.44s)]
*  And Murray looks way better than he did four weeks ago. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4581.2s)]
*  He looks way better. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4583.72s)]
*  He looks more like himself. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4584.96s)]
*  And noticeably better. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4586.08s)]
*  And then in the East, I'm still going to take the Celtics for now, even though I [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4587.32s)]
*  think the shooting, the shooting, I'm worried about most because like the, you [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4590.04s)]
*  know, some of the other stuff, I think they're just bored. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4595.16s)]
*  This happens almost every December into January with them. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4597.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4599.5199999999995s)]
*  But the shooting, they're closer to the middle of the pack and three point [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4599.84s)]
*  percentage this season. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4602.36s)]
*  I wonder if there's some tired legs there. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4603.64s)]
*  Drew Holliday has regressed as a shooter. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4605.44s)]
*  Derek White has as of late and Jerry Lynn Brown looks like there's something off [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4607.48s)]
*  with him. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4611.76s)]
*  I worry there, but I'll still lean towards Boston right now over Cleveland. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4612.72s)]
*  That may change by the end of the season, though. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4616.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's tough when you win the title. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4619.32s)]
*  You go one of two ways. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4621.679999999999s)]
*  You can either come out the next season, like a bad out of hell, or you just assume [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4622.679999999999s)]
*  you could turn it out at any time you want. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4628.28s)]
*  And they've, they started out one way and I think they've settled into the other way [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4629.759999999999s)]
*  where it's like, we're, we're fine. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4633.36s)]
*  We're fine. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4634.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't like that. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4635.5599999999995s)]
*  They don't have home court in the last two rounds, the way this is shaking out, [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4636.08s)]
*  though, I don't think that's nothing, you know, it's all fine until it's game six at [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4638.799999999999s)]
*  home with the game seven in the other place. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4644.88s)]
*  You're down three to two for the series and you fall behind by like nine in the [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4647.16s)]
*  second quarter and the fans are like, Oh my God, like our season might, we'll see. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4650.44s)]
*  I'd like to see them have one streak KOC. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4656.5199999999995s)]
*  Cause I think that's what separates the, the, the real teams from everybody else. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4659.44s)]
*  Like these teams that could just rip off 11 straight, 12 straight last year, they [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4664.24s)]
*  were a 25 game winning streak threat for every month of the season. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4668.4s)]
*  And that this year they can't play five good games in a row. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4672.72s)]
*  Who, who worries you most besides Cleveland in the East? [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4675.72s)]
*  Still Milwaukee. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4680.72s)]
*  Milwaukee always cause he honest Orlando a little bit because of the defense. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4682.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm still like Orlando. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4687.76s)]
*  I'm not just saying this to make Sarudy's night Orlando is kind of hanging out over [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4689.5599999999995s)]
*  there with this crazy defense. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4694.08s)]
*  They're not beating Boston. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4696.48s)]
*  They're, they're offense, their 30th and three point, [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4699.84s)]
*  they haven't had their guys. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4702.84s)]
*  And I know, but they even with those guys, their offense isn't there yet. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4704.0s)]
*  The defense scares me because this Celtics team can look really clumsy and really [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4708.400000000001s)]
*  static and the toilet ball offense can go into full effect. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4713.96s)]
*  And with all those guys they have, they've just guys to throw it, Tatum and Brown. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4717.8s)]
*  And I don't like the way the guards on the Celtics have played for two months. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4722.280000000001s)]
*  You know, I get, we're taping this before I go to the Quipper game tonight. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4726.320000000001s)]
*  Um, and I'm going to the Laker game tomorrow night. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4729.8s)]
*  I really want to see it in person. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4731.8s)]
*  Like, are these guys, do they look different athletically? [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4733.04s)]
*  Is this just a funk? [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4735.2s)]
*  What's going on? [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4736.08s)]
*  So I guess we'll find out. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4736.76s)]
*  The Olympics may have been very bad for those guys. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4737.88s)]
*  Very possible. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4740.52s)]
*  White, white and holiday having a long off season, a long playoffs. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4741.320000000001s)]
*  And something's off with those guys. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4745.76s)]
*  That's where my concern is as well as with those guards and the [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4748.6s)]
*  overall team shooting ability. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4750.92s)]
*  And the Knicks obviously. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4753.0s)]
*  I wouldn't look forward to seeing them in a series either because they have good [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4755.4400000000005s)]
*  basketball players and Brunson's really good and Towns has been playing great. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4758.24s)]
*  So, you know, I do think when you play that team for two weeks, a little easier [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4761.52s)]
*  to figure out, um, but you know, the East is way better than you think. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4765.52s)]
*  Last year it was like a walk in the park, which wasn't their fault, but that's what [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4770.4400000000005s)]
*  it was this year, a little different Milwaukee. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4773.68s)]
*  We'll see if they make one more move to, um, the team they have right now. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4776.72s)]
*  I wouldn't be afraid of, but they're one move away from me being more afraid. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4780.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4783.96s)]
*  If they were to get Levine, that would be scary because he kills the Celtics. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4784.320000000001s)]
*  That would be one of those. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4789.68s)]
*  All the Celtic fans like, Oh no, they got that guy. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4790.88s)]
*  Levine, Yanis would be beautiful together. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4793.64s)]
*  Like that would be incredible. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4796.76s)]
*  Lopez has been great this year for them too. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4797.72s)]
*  If they, if they can subtract porters and upgrade from Middleton, uh, I think, [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4799.52s)]
*  I think they're cooking, they get something there. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4804.320000000001s)]
*  All right. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4806.72s)]
*  KFC. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4806.96s)]
*  Good to see you again. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4807.400000000001s)]
*  You can follow his podcast, subscribe, listen to it, and you can read him on Yahoo as well. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4808.400000000001s)]
*  Uh, great to see you. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4814.240000000001s)]
*  Great to see you too, Bill. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4815.88s)]
*  Have a good night. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9zpv_8_pRI&t=4816.72s)]
