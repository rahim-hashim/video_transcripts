# Semi-Early NBA Power Poll With Bill Simmons | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [December 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTUrTgb6iNY)
*  It is basically the 20 game mark.
*  It's 21, 22 games for some teams, 20 for other teams.
*  We're going to do the quarter awards in the form of a power pole.
*  If you remember from when I wrote on ESPN.com and on Greatland, I used to do
*  power poles for the NBA and the NFL.
*  I used to split them up in little tiers, make little jokes, all that stuff.
*  I'm going to do a modified version of that right now.
*  I'm going to go backwards by tiers from 30 to one.
*  This is going to work.
*  You're going to enjoy it.
*  I swear to God or your money back, even though this podcast is free,
*  I will give you your money back.
*  First tier.
*  This takes us from teams 30 to 26.
*  Wobbling for Wembee.
*  Excuse my voice.
*  I've been sick for like five weeks.
*  This might be my last podcast.
*  I might die.
*  So my voice is going to be a little wobbly, but it's fine.
*  Wobbling for Wembee.
*  30 San Antonio, 29 Charlotte, 28 Detroit, 27 Houston, 26 Orlando.
*  I think those five teams, whether they've wanted to admit it or not,
*  are throwing their hats into the Wembee ring.
*  San Antonio is terrible.
*  They don't really have a choice.
*  They're going to get worse.
*  They'll trade Pertle.
*  They'll make some moves.
*  They're going to be in the mix.
*  What you want, you want to be in that top four because you have the same percentages
*  for top four basically.
*  One thing about this tier though, the league is really deep.
*  I noticed that I've been working on a trade value list for the ringer,
*  which I think is going to run in the next couple of weeks.
*  I think I'm going to have 70 guys in the trade value list.
*  Just look at Charlotte, Detroit, Houston, Orlando,
*  Lamello, Cade, Ivy, Jayla Green, Jabari, Palo, Franz.
*  All eight are in my top 55.
*  So even though it looks bleak, you're in the bottom five.
*  The best record out of all these teams is six and 15 for Charlotte and San Antonio.
*  But at least they have talent at building blocks, so it could be worse.
*  The next category is to tank or not to tank.
*  There's three teams.
*  Number 25, OKC, they're eight and 13.
*  Number 24, Chicago, they're nine and 11.
*  How about that?
*  They're nine and 11 even though they traded Franz Wagner, Wendell Carter,
*  and this year's top four protected first for Vucovic,
*  and they're the seventh worst team in the league.
*  That's rough.
*  And then I have the Knicks at 10 and 11.
*  They're 23.
*  The Knicks aren't bad, but that goes back to how deep the league is right now.
*  The Knicks I have is the eighth worst team in the league,
*  and they're 10 and 11, and they're one move away from one star from being kind of interesting.
*  So here's my answers for to tank or not to tank.
*  OKC, yes.
*  How do they do it?
*  Well, I think SGA get him to the All-Star game.
*  Maybe he can even be a starter.
*  He's average at 30 a game.
*  And then I think he comes up with some sort of heel injury,
*  and you just or maybe you just take him for a ride,
*  and he just doesn't come back for two months.
*  Chicago should tank.
*  And they should go deeper than that.
*  They should blow it up.
*  Copyright Kevin O'Connor.
*  Yeah, I have three trades right now that save Chicago,
*  put them in the Wemba-Nyama, Sweekstakes,
*  give them a do-over, and they're ready to go.
*  Trade number one,
*  DeRozan and Vucovic to the Lakers for Russ and those two firsts
*  and make the 27 unprotected, make the 29 top five protected.
*  If you're the Lakers, if you're going to keep Davis,
*  which I think is insane, but it's a good thing,
*  which I think is insane, but it seems like they're going to,
*  if you're going to have LeBron,
*  LeBron's already putting out all these feelers for,
*  you don't want to waste a great year for me.
*  And the West is wide open, so you can talk yourself into it.
*  What happens to Polinka if the trade doesn't work?
*  He gets fired.
*  He's going to get fired anyway.
*  DeRozan and Vucovic to the Lakers for Russ and two firsts,
*  one lightly protected.
*  Then trade Levine to the next.
*  Levine's coming off the knee injury in May.
*  He hasn't looked the same.
*  But if you're the next, you're like, well, we would assign Levine for the max
*  in the summer, so we'll get him anyway.
*  So do top and expirings and maybe take them back with the four-knee trade
*  and maybe do like a top four protected first next year,
*  something like that.
*  And you have Zakovic and roll the dice that his knee will be fine.
*  And then the last piece, Caruso, if Chicago tanks,
*  is the most interesting trade piece.
*  His contract is really good.
*  I think it's nine million.
*  He's somebody that makes sense on the Bucks.
*  He's somebody that makes sense on the Warriors.
*  He's somebody that makes sense on the Cavaliers.
*  Could O'Quarros be enough to get, they don't have any picks left.
*  Could O'Quarros and something else be enough to get Caruso?
*  Probably not because I have Golden State stepping in here.
*  Golden State, Moody, DiFincenzo, and some sort of future pick swap in 2027.
*  Give him three billion bucks too, because you know,
*  Ryan Serf has been a cheap owner his whole life.
*  And you get Caruso on the Warriors.
*  That's somebody who could play crunch time for them.
*  Watch out for that.
*  So anyway, you get all that stuff.
*  You get all those picks and you're in the Wemba Nyama sweepstakes.
*  They should be doing this.
*  Just Kyle, put that on the TikTok.
*  I hope you turn the TikTok camera on because they should be doing that.
*  All right.
*  Next category.
*  Dead Man Walkin, the Los Angeles Lakers.
*  They're seven and 12.
*  They lost the game last night because LeBron fell asleep
*  and forgot to guard some rookie from Gonzaga who hit a three at the buzzer.
*  They have an impossible December schedule coming up.
*  And if I were them, right now I'd trade Davis.
*  Davis sweepstakes next two days.
*  Who wants them?
*  And I'm starting over.
*  The entire league is rooting for them to panic and put those picks on the table.
*  And I think that's probably what's going to happen.
*  Number 21 and number 20 in a category called panic time.
*  You can guess one of the teams.
*  Minnesota, 10 and 11.
*  Just lost towns for multiple weeks.
*  Humiliated in the Golden State game a few days ago when it just became clear that towns and
*  go bear against any team that has scoring and spacing, it's going to be a nightmare for them.
*  The towns go bear thing.
*  You might remember me saying in the summer repeatedly on a podcast with Brasilo who is
*  agreeing with me vehemently that this had a chance to be one of the worst NBA trades of all time.
*  We're creeping closer and closer, my friends.
*  This was an awful trade.
*  And now there's a new wrinkle because if town is up for a while and the West is really good.
*  And all of a sudden, Minnesota starts creeping toward that bottom four,
*  bottom five in the West, they're 10 and 11 right now.
*  Minnesota giving Utah the Wemba Nyama pick in this year's draft would be the single craziest
*  plot twist.
*  I think this century in the NBA.
*  I was trying to think of anything crazier than that.
*  You could like, oh, the Brooklyn Nets thing, Kobe and Shaq breaking up,
*  Hardin demanding to be traded twice.
*  He go through it.
*  I think Utah getting the Wemba pick, another French guy in the go bear trade,
*  that would top everything.
*  And by the way, A-Rod is one of the owners of Minnesota, which I think is hilarious.
*  This would be yet another embarrassing title for him.
*  See if that many of Atlanta at number 20.
*  I do wonder if Atlanta's 2021 Eastern Conference run was probably the worst thing that could
*  happen to them.
*  It made them think.
*  I think they were closer than maybe they are.
*  I also, I didn't like when they gave up Herter when it happened.
*  They got a protected pick from the Kings and I just like Herter.
*  I value Herter.
*  I think he's a winning player and I don't like giving guys away like that.
*  Somebody they need.
*  They need three point shooting.
*  They had a guy who's a great three point shooter.
*  The game went for like 55 cents a dollar.
*  Panic time for both of those teams because they don't have their picks.
*  Atlanta at least the picks in the Murray trade, their own picks don't start until 2025,
*  but not great.
*  They kind of made their move.
*  Now it's like, Hey, anyone want John Collins?
*  They've been shopping John Collins, I think since before the pandemic.
*  So I don't know if there's like a huge John Collins market right now.
*  I'm guessing Capella would be another one.
*  He's playing well.
*  Maybe you could trade him.
*  But I think it's panic time for both of those teams.
*  I know Atlanta is 11 and 10, but if you've actually watched the season and you've watched
*  them play, like there's some, there's some weird chemistry stuff with them.
*  They can't shoot, which is weird because they have Trey and they have Murray, who was supposed
*  to be at least a good shooter.
*  But the nap and villain things get a little weird.
*  I don't know.
*  I go watch that team.
*  Wait, that team is the team that I could see them go on a six game winning streak.
*  I could see them go to any game losing streak.
*  Next category.
*  Now we're getting into some fun territory and this speaks to how deep the league is.
*  Frisky and lovable.
*  I have as the next category, five teams, Washington, 11 and 10, Utah, 12 and 11,
*  number 17, Portland's 11 and nine Sacramento or league pass MVP at 10 and nine.
*  And then Indiana at 12 and eight.
*  Indiana, the most improbable person team.
*  I guess they're a team.
*  Not only on this list, but Jesus, like I can't believe they're the 15th best team in the league.
*  I thought they're going to be like the 29th or 30th best team.
*  I look at this list and you just have to think of the trades.
*  Each team is frisking lovable, partly because of some awesome trade that they made like Washington.
*  They trade Westbrook to the Lakers.
*  They get a pick back.
*  They get Kuzma who's at $13 million who I have on my trade value list.
*  I couldn't believe it, but I kind of couldn't leave them off.
*  He's in the sixties.
*  They got Monte Morris for KCP.
*  They got a first round pick out of it.
*  Russ is making 47 million this year.
*  And now Beal is starting to show signs of looking like Beal from two years ago.
*  They're fun.
*  I don't want to say House is doing back flips about the Washington sports scene right now,
*  but you know, the C words are looking good.
*  The whiz are fun to watch.
*  There's a little, there's a little poor Zingus comeback, a tiny one.
*  Like looked like he might have 50 points last night.
*  Kind of resurgence.
*  So you got Washington, you got Utah at number 18.
*  Which, you know, we knew they would crash back to earth.
*  It's going to be interesting how far they crashed.
*  They basically lost Mike Conley.
*  They had a hard schedule, but they lost Mike Conley and, you know, all of a sudden
*  it became a little harder for them to operate in the clutch.
*  I think the West is so tight.
*  They still have to kind of wait around and see what happens.
*  But if they, if they continue to free fall, they'll start training people.
*  I would be very careful about training Jordan Clarkson though, because wherever the league
*  is going, he's the guy that makes sense.
*  Portland at 17, 11 and nine, they've had some luck with some of those wins, but on the other hand,
*  they're better than I thought I would be.
*  So that's a backhand of compliment.
*  Like they won that ridiculous Jeremy Grant game where he took four steps backwards.
*  They won a next game where Brunson hits an eight footer in the end of regulation.
*  I watched that game.
*  You know, they would have won that.
*  They had another buzzer beater.
*  They've been missing Dame for a couple of weeks.
*  They don't really have a lot to trade.
*  The grand trade looks like it was good.
*  It looks like the hit was sharp and they're, I don't know, they, they're malleable.
*  They could be a seller.
*  They could be a buyer.
*  Who knows Sacramento is my favorite team in the league other than the Celtics.
*  I watch as much of their games as possible.
*  They have the most players that I like on one team.
*  I love some bonus.
*  You know how I feel about Malik Mok.
*  I kept all my stock.
*  Now I feel like it's like having Apple stock from 2002.
*  He's fantastic.
*  Fox, they trade Halliburton to kind of give Fox the ball.
*  Fox is now really fun to watch.
*  She was somebody I never liked watching.
*  I've enjoyed them this year.
*  I love her.
*  I'm excited about Keegan Murray and they're just really fun.
*  I was going to tweet this, but I think only five people would have gotten the joke.
*  To me, they're the Kevin Owens of the NBA.
*  They're probably going to lose half their matches.
*  Maybe they'll win 53% of their matches.
*  The matches are always fun and they'll sell out for the other team.
*  The other team ends up looking great in the game no matter what happens.
*  I like Sacramento.
*  Then you have Indiana at 12 and 8.
*  Sacramento and Indiana are linked because of that trade they made last year,
*  which was Halliburton and healed for Subbonus.
*  This is one of the most fun trades of the past 12 years.
*  It was fun when it happened.
*  Now it's super fun because it's the rare trade where both teams got better.
*  Subbonus has been really good for the Kings and he's also unleashed Fox because Fox didn't have
*  to share, you know, had this weird thing with Halliburton where it was clear Halliburton was
*  really good, whose team was it.
*  Now Subbonus comes in, fits in great with Fox.
*  Fox has been unleashed.
*  She's having a career year.
*  Indiana gets Halliburton and healed.
*  They take Matheran, who has been one of the best rookies, who is just an absolute beast.
*  Sacramento gets exactly what they want in this trade.
*  Works out perfectly.
*  And they lost the trade and they lost it badly because Halliburton is turning into a franchise
*  guy.
*  I had him on my trade value list, spoiler alert, and this might change by the time we
*  actually publish it.
*  I have him 24th right now.
*  I have him between Siakam and Dame.
*  He runs the team.
*  I loved him in college.
*  As you remember, I thought he should be a top three pick.
*  I was outraged that he was going to be a top three pick.
*  Phoenix passed on him at 10.
*  He's better than I thought he was going to be in 2020.
*  To be fair, just as I'm praising myself, I also thought Tyrell Terry was going to be
*  one of the 10 best players in the draft.
*  So look, I'm not perfect.
*  But Halliburton, 11, 12 assists every game.
*  Great decisions.
*  Makes everyone better.
*  Good shooter.
*  I just, I love watching him.
*  The Lakers play was so great at the end of the game where they get the offensive rebound.
*  He's got like five seconds left.
*  In five seconds, he figures out exactly how much time he has left.
*  Takes his time.
*  The Lakers think he's going to shoot because the clock's running down.
*  And he's like, nah, I'm going to take an extra second here.
*  And then whips this crazy cross-court pass to the rookie who sinks to three because
*  Lebron fell asleep.
*  And it was like, how many guys in the league would have made that play?
*  I don't know.
*  It's less than five.
*  Halliburton is ridiculous.
*  I have Mathur in 48th.
*  I'm going to learn how to pronounce his name eventually.
*  But you think like with Halliburton, the 2020 draft wreckage from the pandemic year,
*  where just you knew there was going to be some barriers, but Golden State has two.
*  If Halliburton gets into March Madness, maybe he rises.
*  Maybe he actually would have had to be a top four pick if his college made a run during Madness.
*  Wiseman, if you'd been able to interview him or work him out, maybe you don't like him as
*  much, but when you're doing everything on zoom and you have three games to work off,
*  I still think the Wiseman pick super defensible to me.
*  It's no different than quarterbacks in the NFL where you take a top five pick and it's like
*  Zach Wilson, Sam Darnold, you know, whoever you have 50, 50 chance and you know, there's
*  a 50% chance it's not going to work.
*  But if it does work, all of a sudden you have somebody incredible, right?
*  You have trying to think, well, Mahomes went later than the top five,
*  but you end up in like a Mahomes, Justin Herbert's another example.
*  And they took the swing and it doesn't look like it's worked out.
*  It doesn't look like he has the hoops IQ to hang with that team.
*  I still think it was defensible, but man, if they had more information on Halliburton,
*  I really wonder if they would have taken him there because he's like the perfect warrior.
*  Washington at number nine should be kicking themselves too.
*  But anyway, I have Indiana at 15 and Halliburton's a big reason that trade was awesome.
*  And I don't think they can tank.
*  I think they have too much talent.
*  If anything, I would be looking to, um, to maybe add to what you have.
*  And what's interesting, they seem like they gave away Brogdon and they did to some degree
*  because they wanted to create some minutes, but no, Nisman's not terrible.
*  They got a pick out of it.
*  They got playing time for the guys they wanted.
*  So the trade was defensible.
*  It's a little like the Portland trade when they traded McCollum.
*  It seemed like they didn't get enough for him, but they got a pick that they could use.
*  They got Josh Hart back.
*  Then they were able to make the second trade for Grant.
*  And then after you saw the totality of it, it made sense.
*  And maybe that's what's going to happen with that Brogdon trade.
*  Next category.
*  Now we're down in the top 14.
*  You didn't think this gimmick was going to work.
*  You're kind of enjoying it.
*  I have four teams here.
*  This category is called, let's wait a month.
*  Number 14, Miami, they're 10 and 11.
*  Number 13, Brooklyn, 11 and 11.
*  Number 12, Dallas, 10 and 10.
*  Number 11, Toronto, 11 and nine.
*  Here's what I'm going to say.
*  Let's wait a month.
*  Go through all the teams.
*  Miami, you know, health-wise, I don't know.
*  How many games are you getting from Jimmy Butler per season at this point?
*  55.
*  Have you seen Lowry?
*  He's just going to be 15 pounds, you know, above his 2013 playing weight for the rest
*  of his career.
*  I think I don't trust him to stay healthy.
*  Hero's already gotten hurt.
*  They have no bench.
*  No idea when Ola Depot is coming back.
*  It's a team that's kind of hanging around.
*  But if you really watch them, and I said this to Vernau and House two weeks ago, I think
*  there's a lot of smoke and mirrors with this team.
*  Bam is playing great, but defensively, really, it's just Bam and Butler when he's playing.
*  Other than that, they're like playing zones.
*  They have hero at forward sometimes.
*  The big, big test for them is going to be they have two games in a row in Boston, Wednesday
*  and Friday.
*  And this Boston team, which we'll talk to in a second, is a fucking offensive machine.
*  And I don't know if Miami defensively is ready for this machine, but you don't want to bet
*  against Miami.
*  So to me, it's like we're basically we're using the past performance and heat culture
*  and all that stuff.
*  And we're trying to carry it over into this new season when they're not the same team.
*  And we're going to know one way or the other.
*  I'm not saying that they won't be good in these next two games in Boston because they
*  might be.
*  And it might feel like the Eastern Finals get all that stuff.
*  I don't trust it.
*  My bet would be that they're not the same team, but we're going to find out.
*  Number 13, Brooklyn.
*  Getting an incredible KD season, which we'll talk about in one second.
*  But the Kyrie trade is the big thing for me.
*  They got to get him off the team.
*  He's playing pretty well the last couple, you know, last 10, 14 days.
*  And they're doing okay.
*  He hasn't had any blowups.
*  He's been seemingly contrary.
*  You got to get him out.
*  Get a sell high.
*  It's that you're not even selling high, but just you got to move now.
*  Get him out.
*  And, you know, if they can look, if the Lakers can bite and they have to take Westbrook's
*  back and get a future pick that they can get spin for somebody else.
*  Great.
*  If they can maybe get Dallas, I mean, Dallas is pretty panicky Dallas.
*  I have a number 12 here.
*  Dallas just signed Kemba Walker.
*  Kemba Walker hasn't had a meaningful basketball moment in two and a half years.
*  And they were interviewing.
*  I love Kemba Walker, by the way.
*  I feel bad about saying this, but they're interviewing them on the sideline during
*  this Golden State Dallas game tonight.
*  And he's talking, I'm going to bring some energy and a good locker room guy and hopefully
*  some scoring.
*  And it's like, yeah, on paper, this all works.
*  If you were 2018 Kemba Walker, we've no idea if your knees can hold up.
*  They won't.
*  You can't guard anybody anymore.
*  Dallas already has issues with guys who can't guard anybody.
*  And I don't see how this works.
*  So I'm wondering if Dallas is the Kyrie team because, you know, I think they need to make
*  a move.
*  I don't think it's sustainable what they're doing.
*  It was sustainable in 2007 when the league was way less deep, but as great as Luka is
*  individually, you're just putting them with a bunch of role players and it's not going
*  to work.
*  The league's too good now.
*  It's, you know, last year they were able to get into the Western finals for a variety
*  of reasons, right?
*  We had Clippers injuries.
*  We had Memphis.
*  They were banged up.
*  And then we had just a Black Swan event with whatever the fuck happened with Phoenix in
*  that series.
*  But I just, I went under on them this year heading into the season.
*  I think I made that one of my locks too.
*  I don't think they have enough talent and so much relies on Luka that, you know, he's
*  getting mentioned in MVP arguments because of his stats and he should.
*  But I wonder, like, do you feel like the guys around him are getting better?
*  Maybe Josh Green?
*  I don't know.
*  It's a weird vibe.
*  I would be a hypocrite if I said, if I was so harsh on the Westbrook OKC teams and the
*  Hardin Houston teams, like this is not one guy having the ball all the time.
*  This does not work.
*  I cannot support this.
*  As brilliant as Luka is, I can't support this style.
*  I don't think it works.
*  I don't.
*  If you're trying to win a title, I don't see it.
*  I think you need more.
*  And that, you know, the Kyrie thing, put him in Dallas in that Kemba spot with their
*  envisioning for Kemba and that becomes a little more fun.
*  And maybe it's just, you know, is it Dinwiddie and Powell's expiring for Kyrie?
*  Is that too much?
*  I don't know.
*  But maybe Dallas is the team that makes the makes the play for him.
*  Then Toronto have a number 11, 11 and nine.
*  They just haven't been healthy.
*  I want to see, you know, Siakam was playing really well.
*  He got hurt.
*  Barnes was hurt for a tiny bit.
*  And Inobi has been excellent this year and then, you know, is in the running for,
*  I would say a possible first team all defense guy, definitely at least second team.
*  But I just want to see all their guys together and then we can figure out, all right,
*  what do you need?
*  The Gary Trent contract.
*  You have some picks.
*  What do you need?
*  What are you going to do?
*  One last note on this tier, the let's wait a month tier.
*  Katie is having a holy shit season.
*  And I feel like I'm heading toward an existential crisis when we get toward the MVP ballot because
*  he is at least partly the reason this Brooklyn thing has been so bizarre and such a soap opera.
*  Right.
*  He demanded to be traded.
*  Asked for the coach in GM to be fired.
*  He's the one that vouched for Kyrie and defended him and all that stuff.
*  And he's also the leader of the team.
*  And I think until until Nash got fired, it felt like the team was rudderless and didn't
*  have a leader.
*  What he's done since Nash got fired.
*  It's kind of made it his team and, you know, he's been a leader.
*  He's 37 and five, 30 points, seven rebounds, five assists.
*  He's shooting 55%, 37% from three, 92% free throw.
*  Seven point eight free throw attempts, which you know I love.
*  Get to the line eight times.
*  I'm happy.
*  And he's playing 36.7 minutes a game, partly because it's really hard for them to ever
*  take them out.
*  I went through his basketball reference because I was like, I think this is his second best
*  season I've ever seen from him.
*  And that was confirmed, at least statistically.
*  The 2014 was his, you know, that was his opus.
*  I think you could say that run he had in 2019 before he heard his Achilles for the Warriors,
*  his kind of contract year run was probably the best he's ever played.
*  But this is something.
*  And it's his 16th season, which is amazing.
*  You throw in like not only Kyrie drama, but Ben Simmons.
*  What the fuck are you getting from that guy?
*  Game to game Joe Harris.
*  He has been healthy.
*  Seth Curry started out her getting healthy.
*  Still doesn't seem like the Seth from last year.
*  So the fact that KD's been able to hold this together, they're 11 and 11.
*  And it's not that hard to get the fourth seed in the East.
*  It's going to be Boston, Milwaukee, Cleveland.
*  And that fourth seed is going to be sitting there for somebody.
*  So Brooklyn's, they're hanging around and they're hanging around because of him.
*  So when we get to MVP ballot time, which I hate to break it to the people who keep doing
*  MVP rankings, but we're only 20 games in.
*  It's pretty hard to do that.
*  Talking to you, Zach, though.
*  By the way, I gave Zach's my friend.
*  I gave him shit for this.
*  It's going to be really hard for me to not put him in the top five,
*  even though he's one of the reasons this team is so dysfunctional.
*  I got to figure it out.
*  All right, we're into the top 10.
*  I have the semi wild cards, the Quippers number 10, 12 and nine.
*  Philly number nine, they're 12 and nine.
*  I don't have a lot to say about either of these teams, but I will say this.
*  On a scale of one to 10, writing off Kawhi ever being a superstar again, or even a meaningful star.
*  I'm at an eight.
*  I've pretty much given up.
*  And the reason I mentioned this is because I have Quipper season tickets.
*  I've had them since 2004.
*  They've been fun the last 10 years, a couple of the seasons, 2012, 13, 14.
*  They were a real contender, N15.
*  Blake Griffin, Lob City, that was fun.
*  There was a lot of promise here with the Kawhi, Paul George thing.
*  I enjoyed the year before they got Kawhi, 2018.
*  That was a fun, or 2019, that was a fun Quipper year.
*  It doesn't look like this team is ever going to make it to the finals.
*  And it doesn't look like that way because it doesn't seem realistic that Kawhi is going to be good anymore in the way that he was.
*  He's 32.
*  He's not going to make it to the finals.
*  He was in the 2011 draft.
*  Doesn't seem like the wear and tear of you're talking 10 weeks in the playoffs.
*  Then you get like Corralba was talking last week on this podcast about that conference final stretch where it's basically you're playing every other night for game three through game seven.
*  What would possibly make you think he's going to be able to handle that?
*  And without him, they're just not good enough.
*  And we thought that was the best dude in the league.
*  Now it's clearly Jaylen and Tatum.
*  They're the younger, more durable version of whatever our deal of Kawhi and Georgia was.
*  So I'm going to eight for him.
*  And then on the scale of one to 10 of trusting and imbibed hardened health nucleus with Doc Rivers coaching them, I'm sorry, I'm still an eight and a half.
*  I'm an eight and a half not trusting it.
*  You could even talk me into being a nine.
*  So I'm mad at myself.
*  I bet on them.
*  I bet on their over, which was 50 because I thought they'd be a good regular season game.
*  And of course, you know, Hardin's already been hurt for a month.
*  Who knows with them beat.
*  Anyway, we'll move on.
*  Next category.
*  Only eight teams left.
*  The Sleepers.
*  I have number eight New Orleans, 12 and eight and number seven Cleveland 13 and eight.
*  New Orleans is the team to watch.
*  They just need to be healthy for a month.
*  What's crazy.
*  I don't feel like we've seen all their dudes together and they're still top 10 in offensive and defensive rating.
*  They still have a shitload of talent and most important, they have trades.
*  That's another this is another team that can just go get Caruso if they wanted to.
*  Cleveland, same thing where, you know, Garland starts the season, he gets hurt.
*  Allen's hurt now.
*  It just feels like they've never had that huge West Coast trip right in the start when they were playing well.
*  And it just seems like can we get three weeks from them where they're just home and happy and healthy?
*  Zion and Moby are the wild cards.
*  Zion, there's no matchup for him in the West.
*  He's going to overpower every single team in the league if he's feeling it.
*  They will slowly figure out how to unleash him.
*  He seems like he's getting more and more comfortable offensively.
*  And then the Moby piece, like there's some interesting, there's, we don't have enough data yet, but there's some interesting.
*  John Schumann had it his Monday call.
*  There's some interesting Moby as the only big on the floor stats with the Cavs.
*  Meaning no love, no Jared Allen, just like Moby basically as like the KG big where it's pretty much the best lineup they have.
*  I still like him and Allen together the most, but the ability for them to potentially go small ball with him, I think I would like to see them tap into.
*  Anyway, New Orleans is 13-1 in the West.
*  Cleveland is plus 750 to win the East.
*  I think those are pretty good values.
*  Next category, we're down to the bottom six.
*  The contenders, I have four teams here, Memphis 12 and eight, Golden State 11-11, Denver 13 and seven, Phoenix 14 and six as the number three.
*  So Memphis, I think has the highest ceiling, right?
*  Bain makes another leap.
*  He gets hurt right as Jackson's coming back.
*  So we haven't seen Bain, Jackson and Moran all together.
*  Once we see that, I think the ceiling of them from a talent youth defense, grit grind standpoint, like the home court advantage.
*  I still think Denver is going to have the best record in the West, but I think Memphis would be the, if I had to bet on one of those four teams, I might lean toward Memphis.
*  Because I think they also have a lot of assets they could move in a trade, which Golden State does too.
*  Denver really does not and Phoenix really does not.
*  But I'm watching Memphis.
*  I want to see them go on a run and I feel like it's going to happen at some point.
*  Denver has the best player out of these four teams.
*  Sorry, Steph Curry, earmuffs.
*  But Jokic is so dominant when he's on the floor and then when he goes off the floor, it's a catastrophe.
*  It's a 30 point difference if you look at that 100 possessions, points per whatever that status.
*  I do think the Jokic's repeat is in play.
*  People are talking about Tatum for MVP, Luca, Curry, Yanis, all the usual suspects.
*  But just don't sleep on, we're going to wake up in January and Denver is going to be 27 and 11 or something or 29 and 9.
*  And we're like, wait a second, are we going to have to have this Jokic conversation again?
*  I will say this, he's the most fun player in the league to play with other than maybe Curry.
*  And he really, really does make everybody else better.
*  Like everybody benefits from him.
*  So just had to mention that.
*  Golden State has a pedigree.
*  I'm not rolling them out.
*  The big thing with them is Draymond looks like he's back last six games.
*  He was awesome in that Minnesota game.
*  Just awesome.
*  I think he had 11 assists, no turnovers and just looked like Draymond again.
*  So whatever happened in that punch, it feels like the hangover is done with them.
*  And or at least as far as we can tell.
*  But it looks like they have their mojo back.
*  They still have a trade to make.
*  They're going to do something.
*  I think test driving DiFincenzo for the next month or so, but I'll be interested to see if
*  that ends up being their swing guy.
*  If Clay doesn't have it, I still don't know who their five is.
*  If it's like they're down three, two in a series, they're in Memphis and Clay is two for 12.
*  Who's in that spot?
*  It's Curry and Poole, some sort of swing, Draymond.
*  I don't know.
*  I can't figure it out yet with them.
*  I can't figure out what their optionality is if Clay is not playing well.
*  And until they figure that out, I think they're going to still be struggling.
*  Phoenix, it's weird.
*  Booker's playing great.
*  Chris Paul easing into a different phase of his career.
*  I think it's fair to say, but still wouldn't be surprised if he could put together 10 good
*  playoff weeks.
*  Aitin's been good.
*  They have kind of the infrastructure, which is why they're from the same place.
*  They have a lot of question marks to me.
*  What are they getting from Crowder?
*  Do we trust CP?
*  Do we trust Cameron Payne?
*  I don't.
*  I trust CP way more, like his ability to play in year 19 or whatever it is versus
*  whatever they've been getting from Cameron Payne.
*  I don't like their bench that much.
*  They don't really have a lot to trade and the Halliburton pick continues to haunt them.
*  They know who they are and Booker is great.
*  Booker, I think, has ascended item in my trade value list.
*  I think he was in the top nine, maybe.
*  Yeah.
*  He was not in the top nine when I did over the summer.
*  The favorites are Milwaukee at 14 and five.
*  Look, Giannis statistically is a little down.
*  They haven't been able to have Middleton and Holliday out there together for a long stretch.
*  They might still be a wing short.
*  This would be a great Caruso team, but it's still Milwaukee.
*  It's still Giannis.
*  You don't want to see them and they're still going to win somewhere between 55 and 60 games.
*  So I'm not going to overreact to any piece of it.
*  I am going to overreact to the Celtics 17 and four.
*  I have them as number one.
*  Some Celtic stats for you.
*  They're 45 and 11 in their last 56 regular season games.
*  They have a 12.5 point differential this season.
*  The franchise record, as Sean Grandy points out, was 10.3 in 2008.
*  They're better than 2008 and 1986 team for point differential right now.
*  They're points per 100 possessions.
*  121.5.
*  The record in the history of the NBA is 117.3 by the 2021 Nets.
*  So they're shattering it.
*  If you watch them, it kind of makes sense.
*  It's what Haral Bob said last week when we were doing the pod.
*  These teams that have five guys who can shoot is kind of like staring into the future of wherever the league is going.
*  You know, we have, it's been 10 years now since the Curry influence started, right?
*  2012-13, that was the first Curry season where it's like, what's this?
*  Wait a second.
*  What's happening?
*  This guy's going to shoot from there?
*  And we've had 10 years of it and the sport has changed in front of our eyes.
*  And you're looking at a whole new generation of guys, 24 and under, who are coming in who just play the Curry style.
*  They play that wide open three point slash and kick.
*  They know how to do it.
*  So you have this whole new young working class coming in that can shoot from any spot, that know where to go, that can play.
*  And just the sports changing and the Celtics like personify it.
*  Like every guy in the team can shoot.
*  It's unbelievable.
*  Robert Williams is out right now.
*  Even Cornette, who's the backup center right now, even he could make a three from time to time.
*  They have five of the 19 players in the league who have taken at least 33s and are making 45% of them.
*  Five of the 19.
*  They have Sam Houser, who Chris Mannix just wrote about this week, who's been, you know, an unbelievable story.
*  It makes me mad that they didn't throw him out there in the finals last year,
*  but he's turned into like the Max Strauss, Max Drew's Duncan Robinson type that you've been,
*  if you're a Celtic fan, you've been wondering for 30 years why we can't get one of those guys.
*  They've Pritchard who doesn't even play.
*  In Pritchard, they'll just throw out and he'll have an awesome 15 minutes.
*  They're like, I can't believe this guy can't be in a big rotation.
*  I feel like he'd play 35 minutes a game for the Lakers.
*  He's barely playing for the Celtics.
*  And then you have Tatum and Brown, the best duo in the league.
*  56.9 points a game, which is we're nearing like Shaq Kobe territory with that.
*  Vintage Shaq Kobe territory is the 56.9 range.
*  I'm just telling you, go look it up.
*  They're shooting 49%, making 35% of their threes.
*  It feels like that could actually go up a little.
*  85% free throws, 13.5 free throws a game.
*  All the advanced stats are ridiculous.
*  And Tatum, as we talked about in this pod previously,
*  he's just answered any question you had from him from the finals last year.
*  He plays his fucking ass off.
*  He gives a shit.
*  He's going to be either a first team or second team, all defense.
*  And he should be because he's a ridiculous two-way player now.
*  He's fixed all the getting to the basket, bouncing off guys, finishing
*  little 12 footers, all the stuff that Golden State exposed.
*  He's fixed.
*  And I think he's been the best two-way player in the league.
*  And if the Celtics are going to be a 60 win team or a 65 win team, potentially,
*  he has to be the MVP because he's the key to all of it.
*  The way they're playing with all these shooters, it reminds me a little of in Madden
*  or even in the real NFL when you just have five receivers, no running back,
*  and you're just like flinging it.
*  And the defense at some point has to decide, all right, what do we do?
*  That's what they're doing that after.
*  They're having these games like they played Charlotte.
*  They had 45 points in the first quarter.
*  It felt like they were going to get 50.
*  And you're sitting there watching.
*  You're like, are they going to get 180 points today?
*  Just incredible firepower.
*  It's up there for me with the 86 Celtics is the best offensive team we've had
*  since I've been following the team.
*  And the big thing was Joe Mazzulla, he's coming in.
*  It's like, this is a disaster.
*  This guy wasn't even one of the lead assistant last season.
*  We lose Ime, who was a huge part of the success.
*  How's this going to work?
*  Guy's been great.
*  He's already got little coaching quirks.
*  He won't call time out sometimes.
*  He wants them to play through it.
*  His subs are really smart.
*  Where Friday night, they were playing Sacramento.
*  And Sacramento's lingering around and they bring in Prichard and they bring in Cornett
*  at the perfect time.
*  And Prichard's awesome.
*  He ends up being plus 29, 11 minutes.
*  And he just has a sense for, oh, maybe I'll bring this guy in.
*  Well, I love what they're doing with Blake Griffin.
*  My dad was talking to us about me today where with Blake Griffin,
*  they basically told him, you're not going to play garbage time.
*  And we're not going to throw you out there.
*  Just throw you out there.
*  When you play, you're actually going to play.
*  So Blake Griffin has now turned into this once a week player for them,
*  which they haven't had a lot of back to backs yet.
*  But they had one yesterday in that Charlotte game.
*  It's like, all right, Blake, today's your day.
*  So Blake's now turning into this 40-year-old guy at the Y who's like,
*  every Tuesday I get a run in with the Celtics.
*  And he played well.
*  And that's maybe the way to use it.
*  Maybe he plays 38 games, but when he plays the 38 games,
*  he's playing like 19, 20 minutes a game.
*  Teammates love him and it's a good spot for him.
*  It's the best team he's ever been on.
*  So I think the Celts are the clear number one right now.
*  I have them leading the power pole.
*  We will see if that continues.
*  I'll do this again at the 40 game mark.
