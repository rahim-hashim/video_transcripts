# Are the Celtics as Good as the Stats Suggest? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [February 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HIe9OYeVBM)
*  Celtics 45 and 12, eight game lead in the East, five games over anyone in the West.
*  Their first and offensive rating, third and defensive rating.
*  They're plus 10 and a half net rating, which has them tied for ninth all time.
*  There are no lists that includes.
*  Wait, say that again.
*  Yeah.
*  Their ninth all time and net rating right now.
*  The list includes the 96 bulls, 13.4 highest one, the 97 bulls, the 2017 warriors, the best team in the century.
*  The 16 spurs did not win the title.
*  The Oh wait, Celtics, the 92 bulls, the nine, the 71 bucks, the 16 warriors did not win the title.
*  And then they're tied with the 72 Lakers who did win the title.
*  This is by net rating, the best team in the last seven years.
*  They, uh, I asked John Grandy for this because I know he keeps track of weird shit like this.
*  So thanks to Sean, they've had 35 games this year where they've been up by 15 points or more.
*  They've had 24 games where they've been up by 20 or more.
*  The Oh eight Celtics said 35, their number one in rebounds, their number one in three points attempted.
*  Their, uh, net rating stuff, the fight, their best five man lineup.
*  That's fourth best two man lineup, Tatum and white.
*  That's second plus 12.6.
*  Their best three man lineup, poor Zingas Tatum and white or Przinges Brown and white.
*  Both of those are the best three man lineups in the league.
*  All the poor Zingas numbers are amazing.
*  Uh, the advanced stats say that this team actually could get a little better.
*  I think there's a world, I think the Celtics feel this too, that they might actually have another level to go to.
*  And the only hindrance would be the fact that they have this huge lead for the one seed and they don't really have a shitload of urgency.
*  Um, they're in an incredible spot right now, at least to win the East and with Denver kind of staring at them.
*  They know they could play with Denver and they know they can play with Denver.
*  And, uh, this is the most optimistic I've been as a Celtic fan since 08.
*  Okay.
*  What do you think of the hesitation?
*  Cause there seems to be like real national hesitation on them.
*  I get texts from people and be like, can you really think they're that good?
*  I was like, I think they're that good, but I understand your concerns.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause I have the same concerns.
*  Cause it does feel like the right kind of street fighting team, you know, like the type of team that's going to be in the league.
*  The type of team that he'd had last year, the type of team the Knicks on paper could have when all their guys come back.
*  Just a gritty physical team that turns it into an ugly game.
*  That's decided in the last five minutes.
*  Um, I guess it would be the hesitation and then poor Zingas would be the other thing.
*  What am I getting from him?
*  Even yesterday, Joe Mass has him out there against the Knicks.
*  There's two and a half minutes left.
*  They're up 16 and poor Zingas is running around.
*  I'm like, just take them out.
*  I don't just every minute that this guy is healthy as we get toward April, especially with this giant lead, just, I don't want to see him in any danger ever.
*  It's too important.
*  So I guess those, and then Joe Mass, just the fact that he hasn't been there.
*  Joe Mass right now for any coach over a hundred games has the highest winning percentage in the history of the league by like almost half a point.
*  So it's tough to nitpick.
*  I think the thing, the best thing you can say about the Celtics is you're really nitpicking if you're looking for stuff.
*  They have a lot of answers in a lot of different directions.
*  And if the reasons you're going to ding them are they're too Tatum's too young.
*  I don't love their bench is poor Zingas going to stay healthy.
*  Like those you're nitpicking.
*  That would be the case for them.
*  Lowest corner three percentage.
*  I try to find stuff.
*  I try to find stuff about, okay, when it's late and we know they have the highest three point frequency of any team, they take the most further possessions.
*  I did this, I think a couple of weeks ago where I talked about Tatum on the isolation drives and that his free throw rate is way below all the other guys.
*  Like people in Minnesota think Ant doesn't get calls.
*  And a lot of that becomes like Ant doesn't try for the call, right?
*  The way a Luca does.
*  Tatum doesn't try for the calls the way some of these other guys do.
*  And clearly the last couple of years, like Tatum's drives and his aggressiveness.
*  And, you know, when I think about the street fighting part of it, I kind of agree.
*  But then I think back and then like, Hey, 27 other teams would take their playoff failures.
*  And if they were really soft, like don't they lose to Philly last year when they're down three, two or Milwaukee game six.
*  Yeah.
*  Go back to the Milwaukee.
*  Like think about some of the Tatum resume games that he has for his playoff career already.
*  And you're going to tell me like that guy can't get it done.
*  By the way, Tatum still 25 years old right now.
*  Yeah.
*  And by the way, like the other part, when you start packaging it all in together, because like I saw somebody the other day on one of the shows say, Hey, this group's been together a long time.
*  And it's like, well, not this version of the group.
*  And if you're, if you're taking, if you're knocking Tatum and Brown for 18 and not beating LeBron in game seven, like that's that's they were just ahead of schedule with some of this stuff.
*  You want to talk about a bad top of a conference, go back and look like that 18 East.
*  Right.
*  It was a joke.
*  They probably should have lost to Washington.
*  Well, they definitely should have lost to Washington.
*  I couldn't believe at the time that they did beat Washington.
*  So there's, there's these arguments that I'll hear, but then I think like, think of all these other guys that have nothing on their resume, nothing like Tatum's game against Milwaukee that you bring up or the game 751 points last year.
*  And yeah, I thought they lost to a better team in golden state two years ago in the finals and the offense got clunky and everything.
*  But like, when I look at, Hey, do they settle too much here?
*  What are some of the clutch numbers saying?
*  Like a lot of the numbers still look really, really good.
*  So this fatal flaw of the settling three, when they're closing out a game, I don't know how you're 45 and 12.
*  If it's as big of a problem as Wake, it's talked about and like bring up the Knicks and going, okay, you know, maybe when OG is back and whatever ends up happening with Randall.
*  And I know they had him working out in street clothes the other day, but like that's still a TBD with Randall.
*  OG seems far more optimistic about when he comes back.
*  And some of these Nick numbers you can say with two different players is similar to Phoenix, but you know, run through the top eight in both conferences.
*  If you go to the expanded standings, the Knicks are 12 and 21 against teams over 500.
*  It's the worst record of any top eight seed in either conference.
*  And I know what a Knicks fan would say is, well, we're not that team anymore.
*  Okay.
*  But can we see it for three weeks?
*  Yeah, that's all.
*  Can you just see put together a really good month with a bunch of bunch of nice win?
*  And by the way, New York had their incredible stretch, even missing some of those people, which is just a credit to Brunson and how good he's been.
*  But I don't know if it's fear or intelligence that tells you they can't beat a Knicks team in the playoffs.
*  There's two things that are just just so people know that aren't really focused or watching them that much.
*  There's two things that are just completely different about them now from last year.
*  One is that they're more malleable than they were last year.
*  Right.
*  They can go a little smaller.
*  They can go a little bigger.
*  The poor Zynga staying there's just games when he's just the other team has no guy to defend him.
*  And if they try to do that fluky bullshit, like put a smaller guy on them, the Celtics just immediately punish them.
*  I think Joe Maz has been really good about that this season.
*  Like you're not, we're not letting you guard poor Zynga's that way.
*  We're going to immediately take advantage of that.
*  The other piece is Tatum where there's been subtle differences.
*  Then we were watching, I was watching my, uh, my old college roommate, John Richard was in town.
*  We were watching the Knicks last night and we were just talking about Tatum, Tatum, uh, Fitchburg zone, John Richard.
*  Um, we're talking about how Tatum bullies people a couple of times a game in a way that he
*  just didn't do last year.
*  And I was thinking about him as a power forward in the 2020s, right?
*  You don't think of Tatum as a power forward.
*  Like what is he?
*  He's just a forward, right?
*  I don't, we don't really have positions anymore.
*  We basically have guards, wings.
*  He can play two guard if you wanted to, you know, like if it was a weird lineup, but yeah, you're right.
*  He's a forward.
*  So he hits threes.
*  He gets to the line.
*  He can post up.
*  You can pass out of double teams.
*  He can rebound.
*  He can switch on defense and he's durable, but he also can play basically four positions for them.
*  Cause they could even play him at small ball center.
*  They don't really do it that much, but I do think there's a world in the playoffs where they kid, but I was
*  thinking about the power forwards we grew up with, right?
*  So you go back to the early 2000s, Duncan, KG, C web, Dirk, Rashid, Elton brand, Palgasol, Jermaine O'Neal,
*  like there was, it was a real position with guys who they could post up.
*  They rebounded.
*  They usually had 10 plus rebounds a game.
*  They, uh, they could protect the basket.
*  And now you go into 2020s, who are the power forwards?
*  It's like, Yannis is definitely a power forward, even though he's probably really a center.
*  Tatum, Lebrons, I guess a power forward now he's a, or he's a power point guard.
*  I don't know what the fuck he is.
*  Ritz, he's a power forward.
*  He's a power forward.
*  He's a power point guard.
*  I don't know what the fuck he is.
*  Randall, Laurie Markkinen, towns, Palo, Aaron Gordon, Jabari Smith, maybe Jalen Johnson.
*  But how many forwards do you think are averaging eight rebounds a game right now?
*  If you had to guess.
*  I don't know off the top of my head.
*  Go ahead.
*  Seven.
*  Yannis, Randall, Tatum, Markkinen, Jalen Johnson, John Collins and Jabari Smith.
*  John Collins.
*  John Collins randomly made it.
*  But my point is Tatum is, is this kind of stealth asset as this kind of 2020s power
*  forward.
*  And I think we're going to see it in team USA too, because you need those forwards who
*  can, you know, rebound, but also shoot threes.
*  And he's a really unique asset.
*  And if you're going to make the MVP case for him, which I would not, because I think
*  there's better players.
*  Part of the reason this team is special is because how malleable he is now, the fact
*  that he can rebound, he can defend, he can jump out.
*  He's a two way guy.
*  And I think his little gross and all these different spots, the stats don't really sum
*  it up.
*  The stats are pretty similar to where they were last year, but I test it's different.
*  So that's my little Tatum rant.
*  PER is the same.
*  Wind shares per 48 is almost to the dot.
*  The box score plus minus stuff is like the same.
*  Percentages shooting all pretty much similar.
*  He's awesome.
*  And the only, the only problem is, is that he's not ever somebody that people would
*  say is the best player in the league and because he's not Austin or for whatever.
*  But if he ends up being the fifth or sixth or whatever, like hell, I used to have a hard
*  time when people put him ahead of Booker.
*  But this year, I think you probably have to, even though I wish maybe Tatum had a little
*  of that Booker, like whatever goes on in Booker's head, that would be maybe the perfect
*  version of Tatum.
*  But then it just goes too far with like, oh, he's not this.
*  I just hear from my buddies.
*  I'm like, you guys are a little spoiled with him.
*  He's 25.
*  Just has to be mentioned.
*  He's not the guy he's going to be yet.
*  I don't know.
*  Whatever this is, this is incredible.
*  My bigger issue was like the Jaylen Brown stuff.
*  OK, it kind of dawned on me this year.
*  I've never refilled my Michael Jordan dream team cup before you go into this.
*  How long is this going to go?
*  It's not going to go long because I'm going to pivot it back to you because you you
*  watch it more intently than I do.
*  But like Jaylen has smashed through any ceiling I've ever had for him.
*  I've said that before, like in draft early on.
*  OK, he's pretty good, but whatever.
*  And then it just keeps going up and up.
*  And, you know, I voted him all NBA last year and I didn't really.
*  I know there's some of the analytics community would say that he actually wasn't as
*  good or whatever.
*  And that's fine.
*  But I've really tried to pay attention to him more this year, because I figure
*  with Przingus coming in, like you just knew he's going to have less opportunities.
*  And so some of the numbers across the board are down because he just has less
*  shots. He is.
*  As good.
*  As anybody of making something out of something where I'm like, what?
*  Oh, it went in again.
*  There are so many positions with him where I'm like, he's just going to kind of
*  pull up and turn around and hit a jumper from there.
*  If you freeze framed it as he's midway through the movie, be like, oh my God,
*  this is going to hit the backboard.
*  Right.
*  And then if you're being you're just like, it went in again.
*  It's a no, he's a no, no.
*  Yes, guy.
*  But.
*  I don't know that he does a lot of like, he may take the pressure off everybody
*  else because he can find ways to score when everything's broken down.
*  But I.
*  I think he's really kind of doing his own thing.
*  And we're this many years into it and I wonder if they get stopped again in the
*  East, if that's the real like, you know, because it was happening before email
*  and the team had turned around.
*  Remember how miserable it was watching them a couple of years ago and they had
*  one of the all time turnarounds end up in the NBA finals.
*  Nobody's talking about breaking up Shailen and and in Tatum anymore.
*  And that's not necessarily what I'm even presenting here, but I look at him and
*  I'm consistently confused by this incredibly productive, talented player
*  in a way where I'm like, is it as good as the scoring is?
*  Is it, you know, by the way, they're winning a million games, so it's not like
*  there's this piece that's, you know, screwing them up and they're flirting with
*  just being over 500 and being a four seed.
*  I don't know.
*  I'm asking you, what do you think it is that I'm seeing?
*  Because it just feels a little different or maybe it's always been this way.
*  And I'm just finally admitting like, yeah, he's an awesome player, but I don't know.
*  I can't tell if you're making the case for him or against him.
*  Exactly.
*  Then you listen because that's what it feels like.
*  So here's the best thing I'll say about him.
*  You probably knew some girl in college or after college who carried herself in a
*  way that made her more attractive.
*  There's something about the demeanor that was part of the package.
*  Perfect segue.
*  Just an Aspen for a few days.
*  You're like, are you serious?
*  And we're like, or is it the outfit?
*  He carries himself.
*  Like he's one of the best guys on a team that's won five titles.
*  You're right.
*  He has the confidence and a little bit of a swagger of somebody who's actually done
*  more than he's probably done on the other hand, he's done a lot.
*  Like he's played, I think he's played a hundred playoff games already.
*  Let's see.
*  It's, it's like a hundred and nine.
*  I have it up here.
*  I'll grab it.
*  Yeah.
*  He's been in a lot of big games.
*  He's played against a lot of great players.
*  He's held his own a few times in, in the 22 finals.
*  He was probably the best guy in the Celtics.
*  How many playoff games?
*  We are at 112, 112 playoff games.
*  Guys guy has been in all kinds of situations.
*  He plays in front of one of the best home crowds and we kind of know what his faults
*  are to me.
*  He's another 90, 10 guy where 90% of it's great and the 10% is really glaring.
*  And he'll have these moments where there'll be a breakaway.
*  The ball's going the other way and he's dribbling and you just like, Oh, he's
*  going to get caught from behind and they're going to poke it out of bounds.
*  I know it's going to happen.
*  Then it does.
*  And you're like, Oh man, Jalen, the 10% is really glaring with him.
*  Everybody's got the 10% though.
*  I, my thing is he's not his 10% is his 10% is like, it's a pulsating 10% of fully
*  admitted.
*  Um, is he overpaid?
*  Of course.
*  Is LeBron overpaid?
*  Would you want to play LeBron?
*  $50 million this year.
*  You're going to be a $50 million player.
*  $50 million this year.
*  You probably wouldn't.
*  I think most guys, when you get over 40, they're probably going to be overpaid
*  unless it's one of the five best guys in the league.
*  I still think him and Tatum together, the fact that those guys really like playing
*  with each other and care about each other.
*  That's a really important piece of this because even there's got to be that
*  little, that little twinge sometimes where it's like, why isn't it me?
*  Why isn't this my team?
*  I don't think he thinks that way.
*  I think those guys look out for each other.
*  I was told a story, the all-star game when everybody was going for each other,
*  for the MVP, it hit that point.
*  And I was barely watching the all-star game, but the East was up 20.
*  So Dame was in there in Halibur and then Jalen Brown was going for it.
*  And Tatum went to Doc Rivers and he said, give Jalen my minutes.
*  I want to see him get MVP.
*  I think those guys like each other.
*  Like to me, that's a, that's a real, that's a real dynamic.
*  I think those guys have grown up together and I think they look out for each other.
*  That was talked about when they weren't playing well, right?
*  It was those guys.
*  And whatever it is, it doesn't matter.
*  And I think it's a really good point there.
*  Although as an aside, is it actually uncool to pursue the all-star game MVP now?
*  Well, maybe it is.
*  I don't know.
*  It goes to the records.
*  Yeah, that's true.
*  But I don't want to pursue it.
*  I want a definitive Bill Simmons line in the sand of basketball history where an
*  all-star MVP no longer means anything.
*  Just give me the year.
*  I want to hear when it starts because I do not want to hear.
*  I think it started this year.
*  No, it's already started previous years.
*  I'm just saying I need you to be the judge on this one.
*  Go back and look, because when somebody's like debating somebody, same thing as the
*  gold medal thing, which is my least favorite, the sooner you have to ring up somebody's
*  Olympic gold medal for their hall of fame case, the worse their case is.
*  Yeah.
*  But if you're going to tell me like it's not the numbers, it's not the titles, but he
*  was the first to say that.
*  I think it's the number one thing that's going to be the most important thing for the
*  All-Star MVP in 2028.
*  All-Star MVP should not be used ever.
*  Well, I from there was a time when it did matter.
*  Yeah, I had one.
*  The 20th century.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  But so I like the theory.
*  So a couple of people were saying how when Kobe, when his career was kind of running
*  to an end and he stopped making the All-Star game, that's when the All-Star game turned
*  on.
*  And then I looked at him for a couple of shots and I kind of just told him how much he
*  cared, and then Westbrook always really cared about it.
*  So there's always at least two guys that were like, I care, trying to win, and then
*  other guys would try.
*  Now it's like we don't have those guys anymore.
*  By the way, I give Westbrook this.
*  He can't be on a court and not want to bust everybody's ass.
*  I'm going to try to get 20 rebounds.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm going to try, can I get 50 points?
*  He can't.
*  There's no off button for him.
*  So that the All-Star game is made for him.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's back to the Jaylen thing.
*  Like, would you rather have Jaylen Brown
*  or two Derrick Whites?
*  Two Derrick Whites.
*  Well, I love Derrick White.
*  The bigger question to me is, is Derrick White,
*  does he mean more to this team than Jaylen Brown does?
*  And I think you could make the case he does,
*  and there's a lot of advanced metrics that support it.
*  But I still really value the Tatum Brown as a combo,
*  and I like rooting for it.
*  I like that we're in year seven or eight.
*  We've been talking about it in this podcast for a while.
*  I'm with you.
*  I think if they blow it this year,
*  if this year is disappointing in some way,
*  and they're looking at having to pay White,
*  having to pay Drew Holiday,
*  also having to pay Jaylen 50 million,
*  I don't see how all three of those guys come back
*  if they don't win.
*  Because they're gonna pay White.
*  I don't know what Drew's market is,
*  and he's sacrificed the most.
*  His numbers, but look at the free agent list.
*  That's what I mean.
*  And you could just see a team.
*  Could it be a Van Buit situation
*  where somebody's like, here's 120 million for three years,
*  our team option year three.
*  I have a monologue ready to go
*  where I'm at the point after this trade deadline,
*  because we had already gone for three hours or four hours.
*  I don't know if there's a bad contract anymore in the NBA.
*  I mean, yes, there is, Jordan Poole.
*  Jordan Poole.
*  It's not about the existing contracts.
*  It's, hey, we're a bad team and we have cap space
*  and we have to spend it on somebody.
*  So even though you can't look at Drew Holiday's production
*  and go, this guy's slowing down,
*  to your point, he's made the Ray Allen sacrifice.
*  He's so much fun to watch on defense.
*  Both him and White,
*  just some of the team defense stuff they do.
*  I would encourage people to watch the two guards
*  when the Celts really have it dialed up.
*  He's such a smart, jumping off people, jumping back,
*  jumping into passing lanes, coming back out,
*  coming down for a double team.
*  His instincts, I never really watched him this carefully
*  night after night after night,
*  but his instincts on what to do.
*  And then the way he protects the rim, him and White,
*  I've never seen two guards protect the rim like this.
*  They're two of the best shot blocking guards
*  of the past 10 years and they're both on the same team.
*  So anyway, there's a lot of pressure on this season,
*  I think, because of the price tag that's coming.
*  And teams are gonna come after Jalen
*  if they don't win the title.
*  Because there's not a lot of guys like him
*  who have the kind of experience he has in the production.
*  Rando, I feel like-
*  He's still really good.
*  Yeah, he's still really good.
*  It's like Rando, when the Knicks fans
*  complain about Rando, it's like,
*  do you miss the 24 and nine every night now
*  that he's not playing?
*  And you're watching pressure Chachua
*  air balling 11 footers from the foul line.
*  So you miss Rando now.
*  It's nice to have the 24 and nine every single night.
*  ["Rando's Theme Song"]
