# Luka Belongs to Lakers Fans Already | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM)
*  I went to the Lakers game last night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=0.0s)]
*  It was my first Luka Doncic in-person experience. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=2.06s)]
*  I got to see some of the number 77 jerseys. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=6.0200000000000005s)]
*  Did I look around and wonder, are there more 77s than 23s in the audience? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=9.6s)]
*  I might've looked at a couple sections and wondered about it, but, um, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=13.66s)]
*  something cool really happened during the game. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=17.02s)]
*  Luka came out, he always tests these first quarters. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=19.36s)]
*  And this is something he always did in Dallas too. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=23.06s)]
*  You kind of want to watch the first quarter of a Luka game because you never [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=25.68s)]
*  know what the ceiling is going to be. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=28.76s)]
*  Like they, like at some point he's going to score 75 points in a game. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=30.040000000000003s)]
*  It's going to happen. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=33.68s)]
*  And he usually tests that first quarter to see if how much he's feeling it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=34.96s)]
*  So he does it in this Lakers game. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  They're playing Denver. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  There's no Yocage. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=42.2s)]
*  There's no Murray. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=43.0s)]
*  Cause God forbid you go to an NBA game and see all the stars on both teams. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=43.68s)]
*  There's no LeBron either. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=46.72s)]
*  Luka comes out, he scores 20 of the first 33 points. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=48.0s)]
*  And you could feel a buzz building in the arena. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=51.8s)]
*  That is the sound you only get to hear when this is happening with Curry. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=55.0s)]
*  When Curry is hitting threes, um, you go back in time, like when Kobe was [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  feeling at some nights, when Michael Jordan was feeling at some nights, it's, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=64.52s)]
*  it's the rarest sound you get at a basketball game where everybody's like, holy [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=67.64s)]
*  shit, you start looking at the scoreboard. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=70.84s)]
*  So with like four and a half minutes left, the Lakers had 33 points and he had 20. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=73.32s)]
*  And now everybody's like out of their minds. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=79.28s)]
*  They, they just can't, oh my, is he going to, is he, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=81.8s)]
*  could he score a hundred? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  Could he get third in the first quarter? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=85.32s)]
*  Of course, from that point on, um, he goes down, he's, he stunk in the second [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=87.0s)]
*  quarter, he wasn't in the third quarter either. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=91.47999999999999s)]
*  They, they win easily. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=93.24s)]
*  Cause the nuggets had nobody, but the buzz in the arena. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=94.63999999999999s)]
*  And I've been going to Laker games. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=99.96s)]
*  I moved here in November, 2002. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=101.24s)]
*  The only other time I felt it at a Laker game like that was when Kobe was playing. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=103.24s)]
*  Um, and I remember the first time I moved to LA in mid November, and I went to a [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=108.28s)]
*  Laker game, maybe two weeks later, somebody brought me, had never been to a Laker game [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=113.84s)]
*  before, you know, grew up going to Celtic games, East coast, my whole life. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=118.16s)]
*  Just said, I always hated the Lakers, hated the showtime, never really understood it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=122.76s)]
*  And I go to this game and the thing that jumped out to me was Kobe and Shaq of [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=128.0s)]
*  this, you know, that was right after they'd won the three Pete, they lose the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  Meadow three season, but it's Kobe and Shaq. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=135.68s)]
*  It's, you know, typical, really good home game. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=137.56s)]
*  The thing that jumped out to me just sitting there, it was like, Oh my God. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  These, these fans love Kobe. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=143.84s)]
*  Like they love him. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=146.56s)]
*  And it was my big takeaway from the night. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=147.96s)]
*  Like, and there's reasons for that, right? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=150.24s)]
*  He's drafted by the team. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=152.44s)]
*  He's a teenager. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=153.68s)]
*  They get to watch him go through the stages. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=155.28s)]
*  Then they win titles with him. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=157.64000000000001s)]
*  Shaq shows up from Orlando. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  He'd been there. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=161.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=162.68s)]
*  For four years in Orlando comes to Lakers. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=163.44s)]
*  So he's a little bit of a hired gun, kind of like LeBron now. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=165.8s)]
*  Um, and they love both of them together, but they really love Kobe. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=168.6s)]
*  And you could feel that during the rest of the run, you get, especially the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=172.16s)]
*  Oh six season, I remember going to a bunch of games that year. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=176.0s)]
*  Um, it was after the trial, they weren't very good, but he just [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=179.16000000000003s)]
*  single-handedly scores 35 points a game. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=182.24s)]
*  And just at some point after everything that happened with him. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=185.0s)]
*  In Colorado, um, it, it changed the tenor of the relationship of the fans with him [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=189.96s)]
*  in a way that people were like, this is our guy, we are sticking with him through [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=195.68s)]
*  thick and thin Shaq's gone. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=199.92s)]
*  Our team's not going to be very good, but this is our guy. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  And you could really feel it that Oh six season. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=205.0s)]
*  And, you know, the only time I can remember with a basketball player was [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  bird with the, with the Celtics, where it was just like a hundred percent [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  approval rating, everybody's all in. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=214.23999999999998s)]
*  This is our guy. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=216.2s)]
*  We believe he can do anything. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=217.6s)]
*  And I felt like Kobe got to the point with, with the fans, really in the mid [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=218.83999999999997s)]
*  two thousands, you could feel it the most. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=222.11999999999998s)]
*  Um, and there was always buzz with him. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=224.76s)]
*  And that year was the year, you know, that was the year that, uh, that he had [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=226.48s)]
*  that huge Toronto game, the 81, but in general, he was a threat to do whatever [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=230.64s)]
*  night after night, after night, LeBron as great as he is was always like a [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=235.76s)]
*  totality of what he was doing. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=241.96s)]
*  Like the, you know, if you love basketball, how do you not absolutely love what he's [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=243.56s)]
*  doing, but the ultimate LeBron game would be like 32 points, 15 assists, 12 rebounds. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=247.56s)]
*  It's a little like Yoke-age. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=254.68s)]
*  Yoke, we don't, we're not going to tell our grandkids. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=256.44s)]
*  We were at a game where Yoke-age had 30, 20 and 15. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=259.04s)]
*  It's amazing to watch. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=262.56s)]
*  There's something different when somebody might have the chance to really go off. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=264.76s)]
*  It's the rarest thing in basketball. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=268.56s)]
*  And there was that feeling in there for a couple of minutes. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=271.68s)]
*  So it was that plus, you know, there's performance with him where Los Angeles [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=273.88s)]
*  just makes sense as a team that he plays for, he's working the crowd at one point [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=280.24s)]
*  in the first quarter, some guy in red, he got fouled and Luca, Luca has 20 at that [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=285.28s)]
*  point, he gets fouled. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  The guy, this dumb ass with the drinks like ball, don't lie. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=292.08s)]
*  And Luca hears it and he turns around and he starts talking to the guy, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=296.32s)]
*  talking shit to him. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=299.08s)]
*  And now he's just interacting with this whole section. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  He does things that I think are pretty rare from a basketball standpoint. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=303.44s)]
*  He does hear the crowd. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=308.4s)]
*  He does interact with people. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=309.44s)]
*  He does talk shit. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=310.52s)]
*  He talks shit to the refs. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=311.47999999999996s)]
*  He talks shit to everybody he's playing against. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=312.76000000000005s)]
*  Like he almost got into it at one point with Peyton Watson and you're watching. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=315.52000000000004s)]
*  It's like, Oh, watch out. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=320.16s)]
*  Lucas piss now. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=321.04s)]
*  Um, he just feels like he belongs in LA. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=322.44000000000005s)]
*  And that was my big takeaway. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=325.76000000000005s)]
*  I was thinking about like, if you're going to have the perfect Laker for central [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=327.52000000000004s)]
*  casting, you'd want somebody who's a little polarizing, which Luca is, right? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=333.16s)]
*  Great player. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=338.72s)]
*  Hasn't won the title yet. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=339.48s)]
*  Little out of shape. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=340.8s)]
*  Doesn't really play defense. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=342.12s)]
*  We'll have quarters where he just looks terrible. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=343.8s)]
*  Then a quarter where he's awesome. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=345.76s)]
*  And there's like always the potential of something more. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=347.0s)]
*  And he's still great. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=350.32s)]
*  He's still one of the five best players in the league, but it's like, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=351.15999999999997s)]
*  ah, I wonder what else is there. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=353.15999999999997s)]
*  So you have that, uh, you have the performance aspect, which Kobe was [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=354.32s)]
*  unbelievable at and LeBron's great at too, but Kobe, um, there was a demeanor [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=358.59999999999997s)]
*  to him at these games, especially as he really, uh, bought into it. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=363.56s)]
*  That was just awesome. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=367.96s)]
*  You have the no ceiling in any game you go to with Luca, which I think is as [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=369.12s)]
*  rare as it gets. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=374.0s)]
*  And it's the thing that I think made Curry so special the last 10 years. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=374.8s)]
*  It was like, am I at the game right now where Curry's going to hit 15 threes? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=378.56s)]
*  Am I at the game right now or Curry's going to get 70? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=382.04s)]
*  Um, you have, there's a one-on-one aspect with Luca that I think is important. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=385.12s)]
*  There's nobody in the league remotely like him, like remotely, all the stuff [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=390.08s)]
*  he's doing, like he got in the first eight minutes of the game. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=394.4s)]
*  I went to last night, granted Denver's missing their two best guys, but he beats, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=396.96s)]
*  he beats everybody off the dribble for eight minutes in a row and he's doing [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=401.76s)]
*  the herky jerky stuff. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=406.15999999999997s)]
*  He's banging people. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=407.23999999999995s)]
*  It's like, it felt like he could post up whoever he wanted and he could go buy [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=408.28s)]
*  whoever he wanted and he could make 27 footers. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=411.68s)]
*  Oh, and he's an awesome passer too. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=413.67999999999995s)]
*  So you have that, you have the Hollywood redemption comeback story because the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=415.52s)]
*  Mavericks gave up on him. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=419.88s)]
*  Like you could say they traded them. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=422.2s)]
*  They got a lot back. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=423.91999999999996s)]
*  Well, obviously they didn't get a lot back, but they gave up on him. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=424.8s)]
*  They didn't believe that they could win a title with him. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=427.64s)]
*  They didn't want to pay him 330 million. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=429.64s)]
*  LA loves that. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=431.8s)]
*  Um, you have the Lakers outwitted another team to get him, which is it, I [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=433.12s)]
*  got to be honest, it feels like the Laker fans have their swagger back a little [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=440.40000000000003s)]
*  because, you know, you think like really since the Kobe and Ash Howard year, and [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=443.64s)]
*  then they just sucked forever and they drafted in the top four and the picks [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=448.40000000000003s)]
*  were like pretty hit or miss and they missed out on guys like Tatum. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=452.56s)]
*  And then they ended up with LeBron basically because LeBron just wanted to [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=456.0s)]
*  move to LA and then they ended up with Davis because LeBron made them trade [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=459.2s)]
*  everything for Davis. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=462.76s)]
*  So now they ended up with those two guys, but for the most part, we wouldn't [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=463.68s)]
*  call it the shrewdest team over the years. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=466.08s)]
*  Then Reeves is a great pick. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=468.4s)]
*  And then Luca is the greatest trade and maybe in the history of the league, at [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=470.04s)]
*  least since the Bill Russell trade. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=474.8s)]
*  So you have that and then you have the night to night with Luca where you, you [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=476.68s)]
*  show up in the building and you don't know where you're going to get. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=480.04s)]
*  And you can't put a price on that. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=483.76000000000005s)]
*  It goes beyond the trade. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=485.96000000000004s)]
*  It goes beyond, you know, the fact that they fleece Dallas, that they have [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=487.40000000000003s)]
*  somebody who's about to hit the prime of your career. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=492.12s)]
*  Like this guy has a chance to be Kobe for these guys. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=494.12s)]
*  And that's the difference. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=498.72s)]
*  LeBron came in 2018. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=500.04s)]
*  He'd been in the league 15 years. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=501.88s)]
*  He belonged to Cleveland. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=503.6s)]
*  So it's a business arrangement. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=505.48s)]
*  It was year to year and it was great and it's worked out awesome. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=507.35999999999996s)]
*  And they have a chance to make the finals this year, but it was always a [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=510.56s)]
*  little bit of an arrangement. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=513.84s)]
*  Um, Kobe is different. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=515.72s)]
*  And when you go to the staples and you see the statues, when you walk in. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=517.68s)]
*  And we were talking about like last time we're walking in, like is [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=521.8s)]
*  Luca giving me a statue here someday? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=525.84s)]
*  You know, the statues are really smart. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=527.64s)]
*  You go and you see, you see Jerry West, you see Kobe, you see magic, you see Shaq. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=529.16s)]
*  And it's like, who's statue where they could LeBron get a statue. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=532.84s)]
*  Maybe, maybe if they make the finals, maybe he's going to get one anyway. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=535.28s)]
*  Um, but Luca, what's sitting at stake now for him is not only can he [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=539.0799999999999s)]
*  become the face of the league. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=545.0799999999999s)]
*  We thought maybe we talk earlier the year, we're talking about [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=546.68s)]
*  face to the league, face to the league. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=548.9599999999999s)]
*  Like this is it. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=549.92s)]
*  This, this guy has a chance now to be the face of the league. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=550.72s)]
*  Could he win titles here? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=553.6s)]
*  Could you get a statue and could you be one of the big celebrities in LA where [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=555.36s)]
*  night after night, after night, people are going to these games to see him, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=559.4s)]
*  to see what happens with him. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=563.72s)]
*  And you can feel the buzz already. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=565.28s)]
*  There's more celebrities at all of these games. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=566.64s)]
*  The energy is different. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=569.16s)]
*  And I'm not saying it was bad before, but the energy reminded me of what it was [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=570.72s)]
*  like, um, when I went to that Kobe game, it's the same thing and you kind of [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=574.8s)]
*  either have that or you don't. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=580.1999999999999s)]
*  And he has it. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=581.36s)]
*  And it's one of the many reasons why that trade is fucking incredibly stupid. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF57VihCHvM&t=582.16s)]
