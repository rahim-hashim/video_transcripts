# The NBA Playoffs Mega-Preview and Awards Picks, Plus Brian Windhorst | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI)
*  All right. Recording this part of the podcast on late Thursday morning, Pacific time. Rob Mahoney is here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=0.0s)]
*  Chris Ryan, the NBA culture ombudsman of the ringer is here. That's a great new title. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5.2s)]
*  Big picture czar of the ringer. You just kind of float in with takes. We're going to try on some [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Thursday nights at least to have the three of us reacting off of some of these games. But I wanted [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=17.28s)]
*  to go through my NBA award stuff with you later. I'm going to talk about the series first because [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  we just got news that Dame Lillard is playing in this Bucks series and the Bucks Pacers series now [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=27.44s)]
*  is a stealth most fun possibility for round one. Mahoney, series you're most looking forward to out [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=33.760000000000005s)]
*  of the eight. Now we don't know the two play-in matchups yet, but we assume those are going to be [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=40.08s)]
*  blowouts. But what's your favorite out of these eight? It's Rockets Warriors. I just think it has [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=43.92s)]
*  all the juice you could ask for, all the animosity you could ask for. A lot of people who are just [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  assholes to play against. And I mean that in a very complimentary way. So between the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=54.32s)]
*  jet fuel athleticism against the old savvy champions angle plus all of that going on, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=60.16s)]
*  I find it hard to pick anything else. Ciaran, that checks a lot of your boxes too. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=65.76s)]
*  Yeah, I kind of wish they would bring in soccer yellow cards to this series where they could [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=70.16s)]
*  just flash a bunch of them in the beginning. I'm really excited for this one. I was really nervous [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=74.88s)]
*  for the Warriors watching that Grizz game, watching the Grizzlies come back. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=80.96s)]
*  Felt like the Warriors crowd kind of died a little bit in the second half as like they were getting [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=84.55999999999999s)]
*  clawed back into it. They're nervous. Yeah. And just you never want to go into the playoffs [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  with your two best players grabbing at various extremities. So steps, Jimmy's ankle. I'm excited [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  to watch this very, you know, version of the Warriors, but the Rockets do seem like they [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  were built in a lab to screw with them. You know, what makes all that stuff better is when [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  Dylan Brooks karate chops it, you know, just takes a body blows from a Steven Adams screen, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=110.48s)]
*  you know, I'm Ed Thompson blocking your shed. I'm sure it's going to go great for everybody. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=116.08s)]
*  Well, Steven Adams has already reminded everyone that Draymond has kicked him in the balls two [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=119.68s)]
*  different times over the course of his career. Like that's not even a top three feud in the series. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=123.92s)]
*  It would be amazing if like as tip off was starting, like a cage match cage came down and [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=128.72s)]
*  it was just Dylan Brooks and Draymond in the middle. And it was like, we're going to settle [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=133.6s)]
*  this right now. I had a couple of Warriors fans in my life who were very upset at me [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=137.76s)]
*  because Mahoney and I did a podcast after the Lakers Warriors game and both of us were like, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  that was really interesting. The Warriors really seemed like they have a handle on a Lakers matchup. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=149.28s)]
*  We liked what we saw. Like that team makes sense to us as a win multiple rounds. And then after [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=155.04s)]
*  that Quippers game, I expressed real concern like that, that, that they didn't totally look like they [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=160.32s)]
*  knew who they were again. And Zach and I talked about that on his pod on Monday. I didn't even [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=167.6s)]
*  know about the Kaminga benching until the next day. I thought he was hurt. And it just seems like they [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  punted on Kaminga. And this is Rob, a different team than they were when we did that Lakers Warriors [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=176.16s)]
*  pod where I thought Kaminga, I think he brings them something extra athletically, physically, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=181.28s)]
*  just as a bigger body. They're playing Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, again, against Houston, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=186.88s)]
*  who has a bunch of physical wings. It just seemed, and they're going to play a big lineup. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=195.76s)]
*  It just seems like you need them, but the Warriors are done with them. And now I feel like they seem [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  really small in this series. This is a classic small ball, big ball kind of matchup. I'm way more [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  worried about them than I was two weeks ago. Is that recency bias or what do you think it is? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=210.48s)]
*  I think that kind of always been that team and they've shown some of those limitations [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=214.48s)]
*  as far as, you know, how much do you trust Golden State in the half court? The good news is [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=218.8s)]
*  probably you trust the Rockets less in terms of executing their half court offensive. So this [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=223.67999999999998s)]
*  matchup works for them, but I agree with you. They're very small. The Kaminga element is such a [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  perfect encapsulation of the Warriors, who I think at every turn have prioritized rowing in the same [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=234.0s)]
*  direction, philosophical alignment, as opposed to what's like the other counter element that [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=239.12s)]
*  we can bring in to give us a different speed, a different punch, other coaches, other teams, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=244.64s)]
*  other structures might welcome a Jonathan Kaminga type under those circumstances. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  But also is he really the answer? You know, if you're struggling with a LeBron or you're [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=253.04s)]
*  struggling with a Luca or one of these teams that have big wings at any point in the playoffs, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=258.08s)]
*  if you're struggling with Tara Eason for that matter, is Jonathan Kaminga really the solution? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=261.68s)]
*  I'm still a little skeptical of that, even though I respect the talent. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=265.92s)]
*  Or was he the best possible solution out of all the other available options they had? But they, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=269.44s)]
*  you know, CR, you mentioned the Curry injury possibility, Butler, just the fact that it's [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=274.96s)]
*  an older team and you have this young, hungry team of pit bulls going against them that also [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=282.32s)]
*  has home court advantage. I can't figure this series out. What are you looking at on, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=287.68s)]
*  Butler? You could tell me at the end of this series that this was like [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=293.2s)]
*  a version of like the early great Thunder teams that came out and just ripped the Spurs apart, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=297.84s)]
*  you know, like where they lost the first two and then they just, it wasn't that they won the next [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=303.84s)]
*  four after losing two to the Spurs. You could also tell me that this is too much too soon for [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=307.84s)]
*  Houston and that Wiley, Wise, Golden State are going to carve these guys to pieces. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=314.64s)]
*  It feels like a real like clash of the titans to me in terms of like the two coaches are both awesome. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=319.44s)]
*  I think that everything offsets itself. So there's like, you can't say that Draymond and Jimmy are [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=328.55999999999995s)]
*  going to mentally dominate the Rockets guys or like trick them too much because the Rockets [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=333.76s)]
*  have plenty of guys who are just like, I live this dark art shit too. So it's going to be like one of [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=338.56s)]
*  those, like, I don't want to miss a single moment of this series. I'm sentimentally hoping for [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=344.15999999999997s)]
*  Warriors to advance just because love watching Steph in big, big moments. And I feel like the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=350.24s)]
*  Rockets are going to be around for the next five, six, seven years. Yeah. There's, there's some NBA [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=354.88s)]
*  historical stuff with this series that makes me nervous for the Warriors. One of the things that [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=360.64s)]
*  makes me nervous is Tuesday night. They got 75 points from Steph and Butler, right? That's about [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=364.47999999999996s)]
*  as good as those guys are going to play in a big game. And they barely beat a Memphis team that [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=371.2s)]
*  doesn't play defense. Right? So you look at that and you're like, all right, that's your best case [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=376.47999999999996s)]
*  scenario. If you're not playing Kaminga, you have no other wild cards for points. Kind of need those [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=380.56s)]
*  guys. Maybe you'll have some, some variance with some threes. Yeah. For the most part, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=385.92s)]
*  you need Butler and, and, and Curry to be between 60 and 65 points realistically. And Butler's not, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=391.44s)]
*  you know, in the playoffs, he's been a little different as we we've written about, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=399.20000000000005s)]
*  but you know, it's a lot of points. It's a lot of points to make up. So unless it's a Rock [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=403.44s)]
*  fight from Houston side, I really worry about the upside of Houston. If I'm a Golden State fan, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=408.24s)]
*  that there's, is there another level of this team can go to? What is Amon Thompson going to be like [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=413.76000000000005s)]
*  on a giant stage like this, where it's like, Hey, yo, shut down Curry. They make this your goal for [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=420.08000000000004s)]
*  two weeks. Take this guy out. What happens if they're just throwing big physical swings against [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=426.32000000000005s)]
*  Butler over and over again, and then the offensive rebounding and the big boy lineups, Shen Goon, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=432.08000000000004s)]
*  Draymond guarding it, trying to guard Shen Goon. This to me is a series where you could tell me [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=437.44s)]
*  they have those bets where you can bet on any outcome on Fandel. Like Houston and five is plus [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=442.56s)]
*  790. Golden State and seven is plus 530. You could give me any of those bets. I'm like, yeah, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=446.64s)]
*  I could see it. Warriors sweep them. Sure. Maybe Rockets sweep them. All right. Warriors are minus [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=452.96s)]
*  166 favorites, Rob. Did that surprise you? Cause Rockets have home court. It doesn't surprise me. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=459.68s)]
*  I think I take everything you're saying about the physicality, the athleticism. I want to [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=466.4s)]
*  reinforce both of these things can be true. The Rockets have had an amazing season that has been [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=471.04s)]
*  super fun to watch in terms of a young team that's just well ahead of the curve. But if you are a [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=475.04s)]
*  young team that's ahead of the curve, I don't want to see like a Steph Curry in a series, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=479.68s)]
*  a Jimmy Butler in a series, a Draymond Green in a series. There's a level of collective savvy there, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=484.56s)]
*  especially between those three that has been so comfortable and so natural. We've seen them run [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=488.8s)]
*  these just seamless three-man actions as if they've been playing together for years. And that's where [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=493.6s)]
*  I think you get some of those random points. If those three guys are in concert, Quint Post is [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=499.2s)]
*  going to spring open for some threes. Gary Payton is going to go baseline for some dunks and get [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=504.32s)]
*  some cuts. You're going to get random points out of that stuff because the Rockets eventually are [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=508.47999999999996s)]
*  going to freak out. And so it doesn't surprise me that the Warriors are favored, despite being the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=512.24s)]
*  undercard in the series. I just think there's so much respect for them and there's so much even [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=517.04s)]
*  sentimental value. As you were saying, Chris, a lot of us want to see it and I wouldn't be surprised [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=521.04s)]
*  if a lot of betters want to see it. Yeah. I don't want to be in a world where the Warriors made that [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=525.6s)]
*  Butler move a year too late, which is entirely possible. But I want to believe in another [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=530.24s)]
*  Warriors run. And it's funny with the NBA where the season of the team that I cheer for exploded on [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=535.6800000000001s)]
*  takeoffs. So I have been roving around, but this is almost like previously on the Golden State Warriors, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=544.4s)]
*  things were going fine. So I need you guys to level set for me. Like I don't really remember [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=553.44s)]
*  the fourth best player on a team getting benched going into the playoffs. It's not good. Well, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=559.84s)]
*  you mentioned some of these young guys, the Rockets that we don't know what we're getting. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=566.08s)]
*  The Warriors have guys who have never been in a situation where they've been counted on in a [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=570.8800000000001s)]
*  series like this. Guy Santos might have to play. I mean, you don't know Guy Santos' background. He [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=574.96s)]
*  could have played high level competitive basketball anyway. Moody, they actually really, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=580.4s)]
*  really genuinely need big stretches from, they need him to guard whoever is hot. Like if Jalen [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=584.88s)]
*  Green's having a hot game, ultimately, I think it's probably going to be him guarding that. They're [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=591.12s)]
*  going to need people to protect the boards. This might be a dust off Kavanh Looney series. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=595.12s)]
*  You might see Jackson Davis, who we haven't seen in forever. The thing that worries me the most [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=601.04s)]
*  out of all this shit other than the home court is I haven't seen a better, nobody believes in a [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=607.36s)]
*  situation in around one in a while. You have this Rockets team that's had the two seed locked up [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=612.16s)]
*  for a week that already is pissed off and has an edge and has a coach who could not be less afraid [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=617.36s)]
*  of Steph Curry and LeBron and has already talked shit to both of them in the last year. And he's [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=623.92s)]
*  going to get these guys. I watched him do it in Boston. Nobody believes in you. We're underdogs. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=628.72s)]
*  No, we don't have game seven. Steph is the favorite, you know, the favorite character in the league. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=634.56s)]
*  He's going to get all the calls. Yeah. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=640.16s)]
*  Yeah. Everyone's against us. The refs are going to be against us. We're going to go, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=641.36s)]
*  we're going to have Golden State fans in our arena. Nobody thinks we can do this. I just feel like [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=645.92s)]
*  he's going to be pushing that, pushing that. But the question for me, CR, who is the guy? There's [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=650.3199999999999s)]
*  going to be three games in this series with three minutes left and now I have to match baskets with [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=655.36s)]
*  Curry and Butler. Who's it going to be? I was going to ask this and I was going to [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=660.24s)]
*  ask about the dangers of Dillon Brooks thinking it's him. Well, you could go through, we could [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=664.0s)]
*  have a draft. It's like, what if Fred Van Vliet thinks it's him? What if Dillon Brooks thinks [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=669.04s)]
*  it's him? We could get ugly pretty fast. Yeah. Jalen Green also will think it's him. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=673.04s)]
*  This is kind of part of the Rockets conundrum is they don't have a natural level set. Like they [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=677.84s)]
*  don't have a place where when everything goes to shit, the ball finds a certain guy. It's a little [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=682.72s)]
*  bit clawing it out. And sometimes it is like Alper and Shangoon making ugly stuff sort of work [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=687.12s)]
*  and fighting through pressure, fighting through good defense. I don't really trust their half [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=692.48s)]
*  court offense at all in terms of the first shot. The question with them, as we kind of saw in that [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=698.08s)]
*  Memphis game for Golden State as well, is how many second chances are you giving up? Especially if [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=702.32s)]
*  they stick as big as the Rockets usually want to play. It may not matter if Fred Van Vliet shoots [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=706.8s)]
*  36% from the field if you're just constantly getting second opportunities. Bill, will you [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=713.2s)]
*  give me the money to go to GoDaddy and register a site called hethoughtitwashim.com? And every [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=718.0s)]
*  night after one of these games, I just put up a picture of the Rocket who thought it was him. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=724.32s)]
*  It's Jack Landau. Didn't expect to see him. I was trying to think of what the narrative... [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=730.24s)]
*  It's a fun exercise when you're trying to think of what's going to happen to just think what the [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=736.48s)]
*  narratives would be after the series and what's leading a podcast title. What they're talking [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=740.08s)]
*  about on first take. When the Golden State, the ones are easy like, oh my God, Steph did it again. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=747.76s)]
*  Yes. Wow. They just beat a team that was definitely better than them. Oh my God, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=753.0400000000001s)]
*  playoff Jimmy, the whole thing. Is that want for that moment of like the warriors are back, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=758.08s)]
*  it's another Steph run. Is that a healthy thing for us? I struggle with that of like, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=763.12s)]
*  are clinging to guys like Steph or LeBron? Are we clinging to them in the way that I'm clinging to [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=768.96s)]
*  Tom Cruise jumping out of a jet? Is it coming at the cost of something? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=773.6s)]
*  I'm ready for Austin Butler. You know what I mean? I'm ready for... [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=777.2800000000001s)]
*  That's on Ben Thompson, I think. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=780.72s)]
*  For as bad as it might be for ratings or for narratives, I'm excited at the prospect of [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=783.0400000000001s)]
*  New Blood. People might be like, who the hell wants to watch Houston OKC in the Western Conference [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=787.5200000000001s)]
*  Finals? I think it'd be pretty awesome. That series would be amazing. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=793.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I would love that. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=794.96s)]
*  Yeah. From a narrative standpoint, I think the guys that could come out of it from Houston's side are [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=796.3199999999999s)]
*  Shen Goon and clearly Thompson, which I think there's a disparity now between the people that [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=802.2399999999999s)]
*  actually give a shit about basketball and watch it. A lot of them work for us and it's to say, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=808.4799999999999s)]
*  hey, have you seen Thompson? This guy's incredible. You're not breaking any new ground. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=813.5999999999999s)]
*  But there's a whole level of casual fans that I don't think have any idea what's going on with [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=817.8399999999999s)]
*  him, how athletically, how different he is. There are some people that voted for him for [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=822.96s)]
*  defensive player of the year or have him in the top three. I had him second team all defense. It [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=827.6s)]
*  made me rethink, did I fuck that up? But in person, it's unbelievable. And what he did to Steph [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=832.24s)]
*  a week ago or a week and a half ago now, it was notable. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=841.6800000000001s)]
*  All right. So we have that as the most unpredictable Ready for Anything series. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=845.76s)]
*  The other one I would put in that category guys is Pacers bucks with Dane playing this Pacers team [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=849.28s)]
*  that has looked awesome for the last three months, basically. Right. They, they, if you look at the [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=857.68s)]
*  conference odds, they're 28 to one to win the East. And I think those odds are nuts. I think those [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=862.9599999999999s)]
*  odds should be way lower because they are going to play. If they beat Milwaukee, they were playing [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=868.16s)]
*  Cleveland and round two. And I think they could throw some haymakers at Cleveland. I just think [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=873.04s)]
*  28 to one, like if you consider like if they beat Milwaukee and now you have to be Cleveland, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=878.32s)]
*  maybe something happens to Boston. Maybe there's an injury. They're better than a 28 to one win [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=882.32s)]
*  the East. Dane playing now I think is going to screw up the odds and make people think [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=887.5200000000001s)]
*  Milwaukee has a chance. Giannis is the best player in the series. CR, why don't people believe in the [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=891.5200000000001s)]
*  Pacers yet? I don't think they've gotten a chance to watch them. I think this is like a good corollary, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=897.36s)]
*  maybe even to the Rockets where your difference between I watch national games and kind of keep [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=901.9200000000001s)]
*  up on pods versus I am out here just getting deep into Nemheart tape is pretty, pretty wide gap. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=906.88s)]
*  And I would probably say that I'm a little bit in the former camp. So it's like, I, I, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=914.48s)]
*  I know everything that has gone on with the Bucs this season. They are getting Portis back as well. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=920.32s)]
*  Is that right? I don't know what to expect with that. But like, look, I just think that [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=925.92s)]
*  it would be so funny if the Pacers just got like a weird slip and slide track back to the Eastern [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=932.72s)]
*  Conference finals again, and that this was like a sneaky great team. I do think best player in the [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=940.96s)]
*  series has got to be Giannis and I still think I'm kind of leaning that way. Yeah. I mean, the [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=946.56s)]
*  DML. That's your take. Giannis is the best guy in the series. Well, you want a big picture. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=951.04s)]
*  That was a big one. I'm also not a cardiologist. Like I don't know what's going on with Dames, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=956.56s)]
*  like this blood clot thing. It did make me a little nervous. So like, no, now he's fine. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=960.24s)]
*  Yeah. Thing went away. It was, it was miraculous, but yeah, it's, it's definitely a mark. Do you [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=964.64s)]
*  think Indiana is underrated or properly rated Rob? Underrated, almost perpetually. But I think some [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=969.68s)]
*  of that is the struggling out of the gate earlier in the season, the skepticism that Chris is talking [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=975.12s)]
*  about in terms of, you know, like their playoff run last year, I think felt so fluke to a lot of [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=979.4399999999999s)]
*  people based on the injuries in the field, based on some of the opportunities. It felt blazory. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=983.76s)]
*  It felt a little blazory. I think that's fair, but I also think they seized every opportunity [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=987.9200000000001s)]
*  in front of them. And I think they've continued to do that and really righted the ship, not just [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=992.0s)]
*  offensively, but defensively. So I am happy to be neck deep in Andrew Nemhard tape and to be an [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=995.44s)]
*  advocate for the Pacers here on a national platform. I think they've been really, really good. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1001.36s)]
*  I think they're better than most people realize. And I think ultimately more balanced than most [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1005.6s)]
*  people realize between the depth and the defense that they've played over the back part of the [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1008.64s)]
*  season. There's a really good team top to bottom. My biggest issue with them is how stupid they are [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1011.84s)]
*  at the end of games. Sometimes they're my number one draft pick for, I can't believe you guys just [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1017.44s)]
*  lost that game. They had to have been the number one team that, that you would say that about this [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1022.8800000000001s)]
*  year. And I was looking at like some of the odds with them, like to sweep the bucks, it's plus [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1027.04s)]
*  nine 20. And that's that, that's insane. They're not going to sweep the bucks. They're better than [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1032.8s)]
*  the bucks. They could just put four awesome games together and Giannis could have his 35 and 20 [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1036.88s)]
*  any game and they could still beat them if they shot well. I think there's too much three point [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1042.24s)]
*  variance with them. The bucks are plus four 90 to win in six and plus five 40 to win in seven. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1046.32s)]
*  And the scenario that would scare me if I was a Pacers fan is you lead the series and you're like, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1052.96s)]
*  how the fuck did we lose that series? We're up nine and game one. We turn the ball over three [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1058.24s)]
*  times. All of a sudden the bucks are down two and Dame hits a three and we just blew the game. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1063.36s)]
*  They do this shit over and over again. And, uh, I, this is one of those, I don't know if I'm even [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1068.1599999999999s)]
*  touching the series from a gambling standpoint. I mean, I don't know what to expect. I don't really [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1074.8s)]
*  want to bet against Giannis because Rob seems like he's, he is like been pushed to the edge. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1079.04s)]
*  She's John Wick. My dog has died. Yeah, but you can't tell whether it's Keanu Reeves being like, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1084.1599999999999s)]
*  I keep getting injured on these movies. This needs to end. Or if he's like, you fucking woke, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1089.36s)]
*  woke up the Baba Yaga. I'm back, you know, like I'm here to take my corner back. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1095.76s)]
*  And like, that's where I think the day in return is such a huge deal. It completely changes the [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1100.1599999999999s)]
*  matchup. It also changes it from, I am a battered man who had to carry this team over the finish [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1103.68s)]
*  line for the back part of the season. I'm dragging like Ryan Rollins on offense to make this thing [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1109.2s)]
*  work. And now you have potentially a really potent shot maker returning to the field. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1113.2s)]
*  I thought before the Pacers were going to win in a fairly short series, like I probably, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1118.0800000000002s)]
*  I picked Pacers in five thinking Dame was not going to play him coming back at some point buys [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1122.5600000000002s)]
*  them time. I just don't think they have enough kind of sup like secondary and tertiary answers [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1127.76s)]
*  like Dame in whatever stays in is going to be out of shape, out of rhythm, coming back into it [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1132.48s)]
*  already has had kind of a weird season in terms of the actual impact he's making on the game. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1137.28s)]
*  And beyond him, you're like, I'm really living and dying with Kyle Kuzma here. And that's not [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1141.3600000000001s)]
*  something that I like to do personally, but live your life. I think that was a, was that a Michael [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1145.76s)]
*  Mann movie in the eighties to live and die in Kuzma? To live and die in Kuzma? I am, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1151.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm probably going to lean Pacers by the time it comes to gut check time for when to make a bet, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1157.36s)]
*  because two reasons, it's impossible to overstate how involved Kevin Porter is in the future of the [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1163.2s)]
*  box right now. They were really, really relying on him. And I think they actually need him to [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1169.92s)]
*  be at Indiana. And that is such a wild card for so many different reasons. And he also needs the [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1175.28s)]
*  ball and, you know, to integrate Dame back into that. And there's Porter. That's one thing. The [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1180.1599999999999s)]
*  other thing is something you mentioned about Dame Robb, the, the fact that he, you know, he has [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1184.8s)]
*  played basketball in three weeks. This was always kind of a bad matchup for him because the Pacers [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1191.04s)]
*  love to pressure 94 feet and they love to just bug people and make them work to bring it up. And [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1196.72s)]
*  it's like, Oh, you're going to have Yana spring the bop or we're going to, we're going to guard him [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1202.1599999999999s)]
*  almost the whole court. And I think they're going to try to put miles on Dame. And I think you're [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1205.84s)]
*  asking a lot for him to just be like, Hey, I know you haven't played in a month. I know you're on [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1210.8s)]
*  this blood, blood thinner medication. Oh, by the way, we're going to be pressuring you this whole [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1214.96s)]
*  game and attacking you on defense. It's a lot. It would be like heroic if they won the series [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1219.44s)]
*  Kazim. So the safe pick is, is Indy here. And that's why the line is what it is. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1224.48s)]
*  Yes. The heroic language that reminds me of in, in Shams's report about Dame coming back, amazing [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1229.36s)]
*  colon. It was very like the language of the blood thinner thing, which is amazing, is very impressive. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1234.6399999999999s)]
*  I have no idea how he's medically clear to play. The framing of it from Shams with all due respect [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1238.96s)]
*  was a little bit like Trump's annual physical to me. That was the kind of vibe I was getting about [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1245.52s)]
*  like everything's great. Right. Narratives coming out of this one, CR. If Milwaukee loses, we're just [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1250.4s)]
*  on the clock now for Yana's trade stuff. That's it. Is that maybe that should be another godaddy.com [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1261.52s)]
*  purchase for you. Has Yana's asked out yet.com. Yeah. Yeah. But like, you know, listening to you [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1267.36s)]
*  over the last couple of days, you and Zach on, on Zach's pot, like it is sort of starting to get a [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1272.8s)]
*  little difficult to imagine these massive star trades unless it's your problem from my problem. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1277.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. So I do wonder, let's just say like, do, do you have a Phoenix Milwaukee like crisis swap? Is [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1283.4399999999998s)]
*  there, is there something in there that you could do? I don't know, but these guys are also, we're [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1292.6399999999999s)]
*  going to leverage, like use their leverage and control their destination to some extent. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1296.56s)]
*  So I'm trying to, it's hard to go into the trade machine and be like, oh yeah, well, obviously you [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1300.72s)]
*  just do this for Yana's. I know that there's the rumors about him wanting to go to New York and [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1304.24s)]
*  stuff like that, or even the broader New York, like it doesn't matter the borough. But I, I think we'll [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1308.48s)]
*  learn a lot from this playoff series. CR, don't step on my podcast in 15 days when I go through [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1315.44s)]
*  all the possible teams. Please. No, I, I, my money would be on Brooklyn or the Knicks because [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1320.72s)]
*  you talk about how hard it is to match the salaries. There's a town's Yana's like very easy [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1327.52s)]
*  flip you can do. Sadly, the Knicks have nothing else to throw in the trade, but you know, he's [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1333.52s)]
*  probably going to pick the trade, but I would bet on Brooklyn if I had to, because I think [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1338.0s)]
*  Brooklyn's sitting there with a lot of assets and some other moves they can, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1342.64s)]
*  pieces they can put together. Well, I just don't want to read another Kevin Durant. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1347.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, I don't want to read another Kevin Durant. He's, let's just put them on the Timberwolves [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1351.44s)]
*  next year, unless somebody can figure out the part where the sons are going to be like, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1355.3600000000001s)]
*  cool sign and trade for Randall sign us up. That's not, oh, and you have no picks. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1359.0400000000002s)]
*  That sounds great too. So we'll just get Julius Randall and Rob Dillingham for KD. Great. Um, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1364.0800000000002s)]
*  let's, let's talk to my favorite, favorite series. Nuggets Clippers, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1371.3600000000001s)]
*  a line that has moved dramatically. The Clippers are now favored minus one 18 favorites. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1380.88s)]
*  Denver and five is plus six 20 Clippers and five is plus six 80. I think it's going longer than five. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1388.48s)]
*  Denver is six plus five 70. That would mean they want to, they, uh, one in LA Clippers and six is [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1395.2s)]
*  plus three 50. And then if you think it's going seven, which would be in Denver plus four 10 for [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1401.6s)]
*  Denver plus five 70 for LA C and that none of us are allowed to talk about the Kauai has been heard [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1406.8s)]
*  every year in the playoffs and you have to factor that in. We all know, um, Rob feels like a long, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1414.08s)]
*  yes, awesome, incredible Spurs Clippers, 2015 ish series to me. And I, I, as I've said a million [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1420.64s)]
*  times, I think the Clippers are the second best team in the West. I think they're a real threat [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1431.04s)]
*  and I think if Yoke Edge can beat them, this would be a way up there with anything he's done [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1435.92s)]
*  basketball wise. I mean, that's kind of why I don't want to over index on that Clippers warriors game [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1440.4s)]
*  too much because the Clippers just became one of the toughest matchups for basically every team in [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1444.72s)]
*  the Western Conference field over a matter of like five weeks. Uh, they're a really tough Yoke [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1448.8s)]
*  Edge matchup. Like Zoo plays him pretty well. I think gives them a chance to play it honestly, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1454.6399999999999s)]
*  if they want to try to do that. And I suspect they will. This feels like a temperature check [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1458.6399999999999s)]
*  series to me on how you feel about Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. Do you have like long term, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1462.96s)]
*  long term, long term in particular, but even in within this series, like we know Denver's depth [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1469.12s)]
*  is an issue. We know that they're not like once they go beyond their seventh guy, even sometimes [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1473.28s)]
*  their sixth guy, to be honest with you, uh, things can get dicey, but if Jamal Murray isn't [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1477.36s)]
*  fully healthy and he's kind of inching his way back and more or less playoff Jamal Murray, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1481.84s)]
*  they're going to have problems. And if Michael Porter Jr. Has those games where he's a little [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1486.3999999999999s)]
*  spotty and the shot isn't hitting and all of a sudden he has 11 points in a mostly ineffectual [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1489.76s)]
*  game, that's a huge problem for Denver against this Clippers team that all of a sudden just has [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1494.08s)]
*  all of the pieces to put it together. You didn't talk about their bench. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1498.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm trying to talk around it. I'm trying to be nice. Well, it's going to be the top five guys [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1502.6399999999999s)]
*  on the nuggets are going to have to play 38 to 41 minutes a game. And I think Yocage is going to [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1507.36s)]
*  have to be in the low forties for them to like every second he's out of the game is going to be [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1512.56s)]
*  a disaster for them. What do you see narrative got Chris Ryan? Uh, I'm very interested to see [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1518.08s)]
*  Adelman's first playoffs against Tai Lu. It's probably the best team I have ever seen switch [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1523.28s)]
*  coaches this late, uh, into a season. And does that give them a spark? Does that give them any [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1529.04s)]
*  tactical wrinkles and how much can Lou think, think on his feet and negate that? Because he's [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1535.28s)]
*  probably one of the best in the league along with spulcher it doing stuff like that. The Joker [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1540.24s)]
*  talk towards the end of the season of like, what did he say? Like a cage beast is the most dangerous [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1545.6s)]
*  animal or whatever. Like I'm like, let me watch this in slow motion, dude. I just want to like [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1551.28s)]
*  watch back cuts all day long. I'm so excited for that. But Adelman under the lights is like a really [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1556.48s)]
*  interesting question. And like whether he does something different than them, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1561.84s)]
*  them the Malone teams we've been seeing over the last couple of post-seasons. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1564.72s)]
*  What prestige TV character does Adam and look like to me? He looks like the embattled PR person in [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1568.8s)]
*  succession. Who's getting screamed at by Kendall. I have to give them a statement. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1574.0s)]
*  Kendall, we got to tell them something. And he's just getting berated. Um, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1579.1999999999998s)]
*  I, I, if Kawhi is healthy, I, I just think the Clippers are winning this series as great as [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1584.48s)]
*  Yoko J's. I think you can give him any stat line in the series and I'm not sure it matters. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1589.52s)]
*  They have so many people to throw at Murray. This is a nightmare series for Murray. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1594.48s)]
*  Just let's start there. And we're gonna see a lot of Chris Dunn and we're gonna see a lot of nuggets [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1599.36s)]
*  welcoming Chris Dunn to take, to shoot from wherever he wants. Go ahead. You can have that. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1604.6399999999999s)]
*  But then he comes out, let's go, Hey, have you met Derek Jones Jr. yet? And I assume [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1609.68s)]
*  Batum's playing, Hey, have you met, have you met Nick Batum? Cause now you're going to have him for [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1616.0s)]
*  four minutes. And I just think it's going to be really hard for them to get on track. They're [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1620.24s)]
*  going to use all the Westbrook minutes against them. And, uh, and then Zubot's like, here's [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1624.08s)]
*  another thing. Yoko doesn't want to get in foul trouble in these games. And if he's going to [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1630.32s)]
*  guard Zubot's the Quippers are really good when they throw it to him teams over, always overreact. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1634.08s)]
*  They always send a second guy. And if they try to guard him straight up with, with Joker, he's [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1640.24s)]
*  going to, he's going to try to put some, some heat on them. They're also a really good offensive [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1645.36s)]
*  rebounding team. Yoko is the only guy who rebounds in this team. Nobody else gets a rebound. It's [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1650.32s)]
*  basically just him. Aaron Gordon erasure, but I'm just saying, like if they need a big rebound, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1655.4399999999998s)]
*  he's usually the one getting it. So now he's got to keep up zoo. And then, then there's a separate [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1661.12s)]
*  Kawhi piece. Can I get a temperature check on big game James under the hot lights? And this is now [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1666.08s)]
*  you're now you're going case for Denver. Best player in the series. We've seen this James Harden [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1672.96s)]
*  play before we have and Kawhi Leonard, just when you think it's going great. It's like the dun dun. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1678.56s)]
*  It's like it presumed innocent when they go, what was that dumb episode? One extra, one extra [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1685.1200000000001s)]
*  twist heart attack next week. Is he going to wake up? Oh, he's fine. It was just, yeah, it was, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1690.0s)]
*  he's okay. Uh, but Kawhi is the dun dun cliffhanger. Yeah. Just waiting to happen. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1695.92s)]
*  With Harden too, honestly, like Harden did not have great games against the nuggets this year, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1702.0s)]
*  but Kawhi didn't play in any of them. I believe so having quiet on the floor dramatically changes [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1706.0800000000002s)]
*  every matchup changes the defensive priorities. And in particular, I like to tie this into what [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1711.68s)]
*  you're saying, Bill, about yogic and foul trouble. It's not just like battling zoo on the block. It's [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1716.3200000000002s)]
*  not just fighting him, fending him off for rebounds. It's you're going to be in a ton of pick and roll [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1721.04s)]
*  all night because James Harden is going to have the ball that is going to be his primary use. Like [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1725.6000000000001s)]
*  you're going to have to hang in that and not get too handsy along the way. And every foul for [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1730.0s)]
*  yogic could mean a lot in the same way that every foul for zoo could too. Well, and Kendall Roy's PR [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1734.32s)]
*  guy, who I think seemed like he did a decent job in those last couple of games, but he's going [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1738.8s)]
*  against, I think one of the best four or five coaching staffs in the league and it's a staff [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1743.92s)]
*  that is really committed to defense and disciplined on what they want to do. And it's just really [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1748.32s)]
*  smart. Everyone's on the same page. They'll bench dudes that, you know, don't look great. They'll [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1755.28s)]
*  take them out. We didn't mention the Ben Simmons piece of this, Chris. Yeah. Some of my faves. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1759.44s)]
*  I don't know what your relationship is with the other BS at this point, but I'm going to get [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1765.2s)]
*  estranged. I have estranged might be the answer. We're in a real wish and well zone. Oh, you're [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1769.92s)]
*  the sarcastic wish and well. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'm excited for Ben. I'm excited for, uh, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1776.72s)]
*  which excited, what, what part are you excited about Ben when they go to zone and he doesn't [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1783.6000000000001s)]
*  know what to do if they do hack a Ben, if he takes a shot, what are you excited about? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1788.56s)]
*  Ben getting hack a Ben shooting in front of the wall in Inglewood, like shooting in front of the, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1793.84s)]
*  the crowd wall. I'm excited for that. No, no. I, my guess would be he gets phased out of [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1799.2s)]
*  this series as it goes along because I think there's too many unplayable things about him. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1806.0s)]
*  The other thing with, with all the rest, Zubots always plays big minutes anyway. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1810.32s)]
*  And it's gotten to the point with him where if he's, if he's, uh, you know, if he's out of the [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1814.56s)]
*  lineup, you really feel it. But they get away with playing but to myth of five sometimes, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1820.9599999999998s)]
*  especially like the non-yoke itch minutes are such a wild card in terms of what kinds of [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1826.0s)]
*  fake centers you can throw out there. I don't see a reason why that has to be. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1830.72s)]
*  One other thing guys, I got to mention this. They really have a home court advantage. Now the [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1833.9199999999998s)]
*  Quippers, there's real energy in that arena. Denver's not going to have a lot of fans there, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1838.3999999999999s)]
*  but it's, it's not swinging games. We're not, it's never going to be the eighties again, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1843.28s)]
*  where you could just put five loud people behind the bench and just have them break people. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1847.92s)]
*  But they were the only five people there. Yeah. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1852.24s)]
*  Right. Now it's, you know, there, there's just a nice energy to it. So for talking narratives. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1854.56s)]
*  Oh, go. Oh, I wanted to ask you a question, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1859.6s)]
*  whether you saw any parallels between the Denver situation and the Milwaukee situation, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1861.36s)]
*  not the joker would ever ask out, but like how different could this nuggets team look [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1864.8799999999999s)]
*  next year if this is a first round exit? [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1869.36s)]
*  I think you're looking at Porter in that case, right, Rob? I think that would be the first piece. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1871.04s)]
*  Cause I think Murray could be on the table too. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1877.04s)]
*  That would surprise me. Different financial commitment for sure. But [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1880.6399999999999s)]
*  I think, I think if the nuggets lose and granted, this is a series they well could lose like a four [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1884.56s)]
*  or five in which both are quality Western conference teams. It's, it's not like a disgrace to lose to [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1889.2s)]
*  the Clippers, but clearly this is a team operating with incredible urgency that sees some pretty [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1894.8799999999999s)]
*  dramatic changes in its future. Why not trade Murray or Porter as a part of that? If you think [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1899.84s)]
*  the outcome is disappointing, if you think those guys can't take you anywhere, then you gotta start [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1905.6s)]
*  yes or somewhere with the actual roster. Yeah. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1909.4399999999998s)]
*  If you can't get through this series that that should tell you gotta do something here. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1911.6799999999998s)]
*  Well, cause when they fired Booth and Malone, you could read that as white flag. We're getting [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1916.9599999999998s)]
*  ready for next season. I have my eye on another GM who might become available sooner is in the mix. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1923.28s)]
*  Whoever, you know, and coach and the same thing for coach. And then I think they kind of had a [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1929.6000000000001s)]
*  little bit of a dead cat bounce where they're like, no, we're not dead yet. We're fine. You know, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1934.72s)]
*  and like we're, we're, we're still, we're still frisky and it's still joke. It's so it's kind of [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1939.8400000000001s)]
*  weird. It's like I, on one hand I'm like, are you guys playing out the string or is this like, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1945.1200000000001s)]
*  I see. I don't think they were doing that at all. I think this was bad for a while. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1948.96s)]
*  And I think they wanted to do it a couple of different times and just, they would just win [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1953.8400000000001s)]
*  a game right when they were about to do it. And, and I just think they stared at it and stared at [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1957.36s)]
*  it. And at some point we're like, this is actually going to sink our season if we don't do something. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1961.6s)]
*  Everything's coming up. Arsenal just beat Real Madrid and then the champions league. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1967.12s)]
*  So for narratives for the Denver side, it'll be like, well, Yocage, I thought you'd think [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1973.9199999999998s)]
*  he's the MVP and he couldn't even get out around one. Like I promise you, if they lose to the [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1978.4799999999998s)]
*  Quippers, Yocage will not, there will be no shit on his, on his feet. It won't, it will not be him. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1983.04s)]
*  They will, the Quippers will win despite Yocage. He's one of the best playoff performers in modern [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1989.12s)]
*  NBA, if not overall NBA history. And he also just had one of the best offensive seasons in the [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1993.92s)]
*  history of the league. I think there's the Murray Porter question from the Nuggets side, then who's [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=1998.8799999999999s)]
*  going to come in, all that stuff. And the Quipper side, if they don't win, then it's a James Harden. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2004.48s)]
*  He fooled us again. If Kawhi that can't play seven games in a row or six games in a row, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2011.28s)]
*  he fooled us again. I think those would be the two things that came out of it. Let's take a, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2016.8s)]
*  let's take a break. Wanted to mention one other series to you and then we'll, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2022.8s)]

*  really proud of us. On ESPN, they would have just led with that and we could have done a goat [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2135.7599999999998s)]

*  We led with Steph instead. We're much nobler, so much better. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2146.24s)]
*  We did the independent spirits award version of the same segment. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2150.16s)]
*  Aubrey Plaza was hosting this podcast. Adam Scott came in. Do you give the two [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2153.44s)]
*  wolves a chance in this series, Rob? Absolutely. I think there's a real possibility, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2160.88s)]
*  and I'm not willing to stake all of these claims at once, but there's a real possibility that all [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2165.68s)]
*  three of these are upsets, that every non-OKC series in the West is an upset. I'm not just [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2169.52s)]
*  zooming past the wolves at all. I think the Lakers understandably, given just the collective [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2175.28s)]
*  brain power between Luca and LeBron and the way that they really rip you apart over the course of [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2179.6800000000003s)]
*  seven games, deserves a ton of respect and a ton of deference as we're parsing out what's going to [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2185.28s)]
*  happen in this series. Ant is still pretty unguardable and you can pressure him and you [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2189.52s)]
*  can trap him and you can try to make him do difficult things, but this is a pretty capable, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2194.0800000000004s)]
*  pretty deep team. They also require you to bet heavily on Julius Randall being good in the [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2198.4s)]
*  playoffs. They require you to really believe in Rudy Gobert's ability to hang in this matchup. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2203.36s)]
*  I'm probably a little more bullish on that than most, but I just like the wolves. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2208.48s)]
*  Hold on. Wait a second. Why are you bullish on that? [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2211.52s)]
*  I don't think he's a train wreck. I think most of the time that Rudy Gobert gets [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2214.2400000000002s)]
*  dragged across the coals is mostly misplaced frustration at perimeter people who can't guard [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2217.84s)]
*  anybody or matchups that happen for three minutes of a game. But overall, he may not be always [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2223.2000000000003s)]
*  playing up to a defensive player that your standards, and frankly, he hasn't been that guy [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2228.96s)]
*  this year or last year really at all. He's kind of come down a level, but he's a good NBA player [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2232.8s)]
*  and he's a good player who has some leverage in a series like this. I think he will make an impact [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2237.44s)]
*  on it. Do you think it's an advantage, Rob, that Finch has introduced this idea that there's no [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2241.76s)]
*  sacred cows on this team early in the season where he's like, I might run this five out for the end [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2248.2400000000002s)]
*  or I might run this five out. And it's like, just because of your rep, just because of the name on [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2253.52s)]
*  the back of the jersey doesn't mean you're out here because you do quote unquote deserve it. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2257.1200000000003s)]
*  It's who I think is the best matchup at the end of games. If he's been doing that all season, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2262.4s)]
*  maybe Gobert is more emotionally prepared for eventualities where he's not on the floor because [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2268.48s)]
*  the Lakers are throwing something at the Wolves that he's not suited for. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2273.76s)]
*  Yeah. I think you hope that that's the case. And from a coaching perspective, you're right. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2278.96s)]
*  You're doing kind of everything you can to prime your players for that possibility. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2283.12s)]
*  Bottom line, your team has Anthony Edwards, Jane McDaniels, Rudy Gobert, Julius Randall. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2287.6s)]
*  These are highly emotional players, if we're all being honest about the way that they operate and [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2293.2799999999997s)]
*  conduct themselves. They've had fights in huddles. They've punched things and gotten injured. This is [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2297.52s)]
*  the core of your team and you're going to ride and die with some of that emotion. And there's [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2302.64s)]
*  inevitably going to be a fallout during the really, really tough moments. But maybe you can get away [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2305.92s)]
*  with that for a series. Maybe you can get away with that for a couple of games at a time. I think you [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2310.64s)]
*  just have to kind of ride the right wave with it. I had a Minnesota fan try to zag with Gobert. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2314.4s)]
*  And I appreciated it. I won't name who it was, but they were like, you know, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2320.88s)]
*  everybody's talking about playing Gobert off the court. What about Gobert's high lobs? Who's [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2324.96s)]
*  contesting those in the Lakers? I was like, oh, I kind of like that one. He might play Jackson Hayes [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2329.04s)]
*  off the court. Who are the rim protectors on the Lakers? I was like, well, they don't really have [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2334.08s)]
*  some. And then the other point was that you can actually hide Gobert in this series a little bit [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2338.64s)]
*  more than people realize. Like if Jackson Hayes is out there, he just stays with him. And if they're [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2345.8399999999997s)]
*  going to set picks where Jackson Hayes is doing setting the pick, good luck to you. And then when [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2350.0s)]
*  Ruiz is out there, he probably shades closer to Ruiz or Phinney Smith and does the thing that [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2354.3199999999997s)]
*  the Celtics do with Porzingis where he's near the corner, but he can jump back in. And I don't know, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2360.48s)]
*  they were just a little more bullish on it than I thought. There's a best player in the series [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2366.48s)]
*  question with this series that's really fun. Where you're like, well, obviously, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2371.04s)]
*  Luke or LeBron. It's like, I don't know how obvious it is. Like what if Edwards is just incredible? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2374.64s)]
*  Edwards certainly thinks he's the best player in the series. There's some, you know, LeBron's 40 [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2380.0s)]
*  years old. I feel like if you're going to always talk about, well, what if Kawhi gets hurt? I still [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2386.88s)]
*  think we have to at least mention, well, what if a 40 year old guy playing really physical, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2391.44s)]
*  awesome playoff games every two, three days? Like, are we counting on that for three rounds? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2396.32s)]
*  I think that has to be mentioned. And then the targeting Reeves on defense, I think. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2400.56s)]
*  The smarter teams have done it. The Lakers know it's coming. How much of that are they going to [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2405.6s)]
*  do it? I think it's an awesome series. If you had to pick, who are you picking, Rob? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2410.96s)]
*  I would pick the Lakers, but I think it's going to be long. Like I'm very tempted to pick like [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2414.2400000000002s)]
*  a Lakers and seven. CR, do you think Minnesota, you think they get 30% of the calls this series? [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2417.76s)]
*  28%? Where would you put it? Yeah. What's the circuit breaker? What's the lowest amount of [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2424.2400000000002s)]
*  calls they could get for the NBA breaks? I think, I think 30 is a nice number. I'm, I'm, I'm going [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2429.28s)]
*  with the Wolves. Go with the Wolves. Yeah. Hell yeah. Yeah. It's an awesome series. I'll tell you [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2435.6000000000004s)]
*  this. The Fandel line of Minnesota being a plus one 56 underdog and the Lakers being almost two to [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2444.0s)]
*  one seems off to me because Minnesota has enough talent to hang with this. It, to me, this feels [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2449.6s)]
*  like a Lakers and seven. You've been watching Lucas so closely over the last couple of weeks, Bill, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2455.36s)]
*  like, do you feel like he's got his head screwed on right for this? For the postseason? I liked what [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2460.8s)]
*  I saw from him last week, but I absolutely think one of Minnesota's game plans is going to be to [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2465.84s)]
*  try to agitate him and annoy her and hope that he gets mad, hope that he gets technicals, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2470.48s)]
*  hope that he gets into mano a mano stuff. I think, I, I just think he's shown some real [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2476.16s)]
*  immaturity on the court. Like he, all the same stuff he's been doing the first seven years of [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2482.16s)]
*  his career, he still does. He still talks to people in the front row, all that shit. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2487.6s)]
*  And I think Minnesota has a bunch of guys who love that, you know? And the other thing [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2491.92s)]
*  of Minnesota is it's definitely an irrational confidence team, right? They're not going to be, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2496.08s)]
*  nobody's going to be scared. They're not going to be, oh my God, we're playing in LA. Like they're, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2500.3199999999997s)]
*  they don't give a shit. They're not going to care that celebrities are around the, uh, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2504.96s)]
*  around the front. Um, yeah, this will be a good one. I forgot to mention with the rocket series [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2509.2s)]
*  and maybe with the Pistons Knicks, which is the last one I want to talk about quickly. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2515.92s)]
*  I don't think kids should be allowed in the front row for either of those series. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2519.52s)]
*  Is a great seat. I think it has to be 12, 12 and up. You must be like a Disneyland ride. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2522.56s)]
*  Yeah. If you're nine and under, you don't get to sit Knicks Pistons. I almost think that's like an [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2529.52s)]
*  NC 17 movie. You have to be 18 and older to sit in the front row. Yeah. Child services should be [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2534.88s)]
*  called if you've got like a six year old kid to Knicks Pistons and that kid gets trampled [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2539.12s)]
*  by Ron Holland during like a massive bra. I don't feel sorry for you. I don't feel sorry that your [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2545.2s)]
*  kid broke his wrist when he's six years old. You should not be in the front row for that series. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2551.52s)]
*  Counterpoint to this. That'll build character. Oh, there we go. And we're, we're, we're facing [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2556.08s)]
*  down a time in this country where people are going to maybe have to go back to the factories [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2562.32s)]
*  and what better way to prepare you than by witnessing a massive bra. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2566.32s)]
*  If you're over 70 years old, stay out of the first row. I'm just warning you now. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2570.24s)]
*  This is the thing. I don't know that there's an age at which you are safe from an Isaiah Stewart [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2574.4s)]
*  elbow. You know, like if it comes down to that, it really doesn't matter if you're a child. It [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2578.4s)]
*  doesn't matter if you're elderly. Like these guys are going to spill over and I respect the hell out [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2582.08s)]
*  of it. Yeah. Cause I don't think you could rule out Lakers Wolves either for some sort of, some [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2585.92s)]
*  sort of feistiness, but Rockets Warriors clearly shits going down in that series. And the Rockets [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2590.8s)]
*  are going to hit Curry. They're going to hold him 50 feet from the basket on every screen. They're [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2597.44s)]
*  going to knock him down when he goes to the hoop. It's, it's, it's just going to be on. Definitely [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2602.64s)]
*  yanking that guy's thumb. I mean, it is, it's going to be like, Oh no. Of course. Pistons, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2607.2s)]
*  Knicks, any chance Rob? It's a, it's a real climb. I think there's, there's places where the Pistons [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2613.04s)]
*  are going to have definite advantages. Like that's a matchup that really suits Cade. I think he's [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2619.3599999999997s)]
*  going to play great. I think overall the orchestration is going to be there, but keeping [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2623.12s)]
*  up with the Knicks and kind of the sheer firepower of what they're capable of with all of their guys [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2627.12s)]
*  out there is, is brutal. And I think even more brutal now, like they've had a weird season. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2631.68s)]
*  They've been up and down. They haven't all been together. Like they've played a lot together, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2636.4s)]
*  but in terms of the chemistry of that core five hasn't been as scintillating as I might have hoped [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2640.0s)]
*  coming into the season. But then you get stretches where Brunson's out and OG and [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2644.64s)]
*  Anoby transforms into this totally different guy. Maybe there's a huge payoff for that, right? Maybe [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2649.2000000000003s)]
*  there's a payoff for those minutes where, you know, Townes is in foul trouble. Brunson has to [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2654.1600000000003s)]
*  leave the game for a bit, or is just kind of being locked up in a certain matchup. Maybe Ron Holland [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2658.2400000000002s)]
*  or Asar Thompson's all up in his jersey for long stretches. And now it's the OG and Anoby show. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2662.56s)]
*  And I think that's something that the Pistons just don't have counters for, is that sort of [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2667.1200000000003s)]
*  layered offensive threat. Great regular season story, CR. I think this is probably where the [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2671.36s)]
*  train gets off and maybe they win one. I think Knicks in four at plus 520 or Knicks in five at [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2678.2400000000002s)]
*  plus 270. Those are probably two of my favorite bets. The one question I have with the Knicks, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2684.7200000000003s)]
*  Ken Tibbs figure out a way to, like, could Brunson end up with a minutes per game in this [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2688.96s)]
*  series of like 48.2? Like if there was like an overtime. Yeah. Are all five guys going to be in [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2694.32s)]
*  the 40s every game? Because there's like two days off between games. Yeah. Brunson has to do [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2701.6s)]
*  halftime entertainment. Does he have to do the red band? Yeah, he has to go out there and spin [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2706.08s)]
*  plates. I just want to say I was always a big Kate Cunningham fan and I was really worried that [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2711.36s)]
*  his career was going to kind of get basically torpedoed by the institutional malaise of the [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2718.16s)]
*  Pistons. So to see this turnaround is really cool. I hope that everybody, because it's the Knicks, [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2724.56s)]
*  it's New York, there's going to be a ton of people watching this series just inevitably, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2730.72s)]
*  that it's a great platform and he goes off no matter what happens. I think the Pistons [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2734.48s)]
*  definitely get one at home and it's a feel good story. And I just, I think it's a cool platform [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2738.72s)]
*  to introduce a new start of the league. Yeah. Rob, are you watching institutional malaise on [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2743.84s)]
*  Paramount? You know, I thought it was a real slog mid-season. It just, it kind of lost me. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2749.28s)]
*  I thought it was good to see Karlo Jugino like trying again with one of the Wilson brothers. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2754.32s)]
*  She's a lawyer. He's just trying to make it work with this institution. But Nicole Kidman's three [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2759.76s)]
*  episode arc, I thought that was pretty good. We should create a video show for the Ringer [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2763.36s)]
*  Dash TV YouTube thing where we just list four shows and three of them are real and one is made [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2768.48s)]
*  up. And then the viewers have to guess which one we made up. Cause I think it would be near impossible [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2774.16s)]
*  at this point. And Apple will have some shows where I'm just like, wow. Yeah. What is that? [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2779.36s)]
*  That was greenlit? There was a show that I heard about the other day called State of the Union [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2787.28s)]
*  with Chris O'Dowd and Rosamund Pike. And it's just about their marriage and Nick Hornby wrote it. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2791.92s)]
*  And I was like, this feels like a poster in Seth Rogen's office in the studio. Yes. Right. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2797.12s)]
*  Like the show that they- Yeah. It's almost like made it even more noticeable. Yeah. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2805.12s)]
*  Rob, are you a 1923 guy? I'm not. Should I be? Oh, wow. Am I missing out? What do you think you are? [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2810.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it's not my favorite Sheridan, but it definitely ended with some fireworks. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2818.2400000000002s)]
*  I prefer my Sheridan modern, if I'm being honest with you. I prefer it with, you know, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2824.16s)]
*  guns a blazing, but in a more modern setting, maybe a drug runner is involved, maybe not. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2828.64s)]
*  I have season tickets now for Sheridan. That's where I've landed. Sure. I really like 1923, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2834.3199999999997s)]
*  but it's one of the all time couple shows for my wife and I. My wife loves it. I have no idea why. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2840.3199999999997s)]
*  And she loves shows set in the 1800s and 1900s cause she feels like she really would have been [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2846.64s)]
*  an impactful person back then. What does an impactful person back then look like? [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2851.2s)]
*  She would have absolutely been able to defend the ranch with guns and would have been able [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2856.72s)]
*  to survive in the cold. She would have hit that train, the lady waiting for the train who was [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2861.52s)]
*  freezing to death. She's like, I would have made it. I would have been able to make it until the [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2866.64s)]
*  train showed up. Yeah. I would have died in the first episode. The median show for a couple is [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2870.08s)]
*  an interesting conversation. Like what show ticks three boxes each? I think- Oh, I think Presumed [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2874.8799999999997s)]
*  Innocent is a 10 out of 10 on that scale. Friends and neighbors right now for my wife and I. 100%. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2880.32s)]
*  Great one. Taking equal boxes. Yeah. Just ham, hamming it up. Yeah. He's having a ham old time. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2885.52s)]
*  Okay. Playing games really quick. I picked Miami against Chicago and I think they're also going to [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2893.36s)]
*  beat Atlanta and that line is only minus one. There's no case for the Hawks, is there, Rob? [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2899.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, there's a case in that other than what you may have been led to believe, by the way, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2903.84s)]
*  he just shellacked the pulse. This team can't really score in most games. And so I don't put [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2909.2000000000003s)]
*  it past them on any night to have like a 15 point quarter followed by a 13 point quarter. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2915.12s)]
*  Who do you think Cleveland would rather play? Probably Atlanta, right? I don't think they care. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2920.0s)]
*  I think they're probably, I mean, look, yeah, if given the choice, one of them is maybe a little [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2923.92s)]
*  less physically taxing than the other, but I don't think the Cavs are having a problem with either [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2927.6800000000003s)]
*  of those teams. You guys enjoying the play-in experience? I think they could dump the nine, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2930.88s)]
*  10 pretty easily and we'd be good. I think we could go seven, eight and then loser plays eight, [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2935.2s)]
*  nine, or we go eight, nine first. Yeah. They play the seven, some version of that. I just, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2942.3999999999996s)]
*  although I guess Sacramento still in, but it's almost like they need the college football [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2949.7599999999998s)]
*  committee from the mid eighties to kind of step in and just be like, now we've decided Sacramento [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2955.6s)]
*  is not a nine, 10 team. SAC fired their GM while they're still in? No, no, no. Like they would be in. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2960.8s)]
*  Oh, they would be in. I see what you're saying. Yeah. No, it's just, you know, you see those games. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2966.6400000000003s)]
*  There was one good game out of four. I think they're probably hoping there's two good games [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2972.48s)]
*  out of four. So yeah, it's pretty tough. I think year to year it's just impossible to know. And so [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2976.88s)]
*  they keep the option open for the most possible good games and some junk is going to filter in. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2981.44s)]
*  Like we're just going to have to sit through it. I think. Yeah. Um, CR, I know about three weeks [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2986.08s)]
*  ago, I heard through the grapevine, you and your, uh, financial team bought some Nico Harrison stock [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2991.92s)]
*  the lowest possible level. You're like, I want to bet on this guy. A lot of connections, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=2999.2799999999997s)]
*  did some great stuff in the shoe industry. Um, made some good trades, got pulled the [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3003.68s)]
*  maps to the finals last year. The stock's never been lower. I'm going to invest. And then Dallas [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3009.2799999999997s)]
*  looks awesome last night in the playing game. How are you feeling about your holdings? [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3014.64s)]
*  I'm the Charlie Munger of buying into front offices. Uh, I, I find it incredibly funny [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3018.7999999999997s)]
*  with all due respect to our former farmer colleague, Jason Gallagher, who's really going [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3025.2799999999997s)]
*  through it on social media about the, the Dallas situation. Yeah. It was just kind of like, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3029.92s)]
*  of course they're going to get into the playoffs and we're going to keep having to talk about this. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3035.6s)]
*  Um, I, I still think obviously it is historically bad trade, but it's, it's good. Yeah. I don't [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3039.36s)]
*  know. Nico Harrison said they were a championship level team for two and a half quarters. Like what [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3047.1200000000003s)]
*  more compelling evidence do you need? Yeah. Well, my question is if they did, if they do, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3050.88s)]
*  there's six and a half point underdogs in Memphis. And I, to me, that game's a toss up [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3057.2000000000003s)]
*  because I could just see Davis going nuts in that game. Um, if they did get in the okay, see thing [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3060.96s)]
*  one eight and then Davis goes nuts in the first game and it just, it's the most fun, random [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3067.36s)]
*  scenario. None of us would have expected like, Oh my God, Dallas is up two one. And Nico's like, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3073.04s)]
*  fuck all of you guys. I told you if we had Kyrie, we'd be winning this thing. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3078.48s)]
*  All the fans are wearing Joker masks and kind of like, uh, how am I supposed to feel? [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3082.7200000000003s)]
*  Rob, who do you think? Okay. See, I know they don't care either, but who would they rather play? [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3090.64s)]
*  I think they'd rather play Dallas. I think they'd rather play the team that basically doesn't have [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3094.88s)]
*  functional point guards, uh, that's starting Najee Marshall out of necessity. That's running [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3099.12s)]
*  Brandon Williams out there who's played relatively well, but there's like, there's a reason why when [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3103.2000000000003s)]
*  you play against anyone who's not the Kings and you're the Mavs, you struggle to get the ball [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3108.8s)]
*  anywhere it needs to go in the half court. They just don't have enough, not just spacing, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3112.8s)]
*  but the floor balance is kind of busted. They don't have enough playmaking in general right now. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3116.4s)]
*  I think that would have been the case even if Kyrie was healthy, to be honest with you, but [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3120.4s)]
*  it's especially true now. Lou Dordt's going to be like, I don't know who to guard. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3123.52s)]
*  Who do you want me to shut down? All of these guys are mediocre. Um, I want Dallas to keep winning [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3130.16s)]
*  because I think it would be hilarious, but yeah, this worked out unbelievably well for OKC and this [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3136.24s)]
*  is why you get the one seed and this is what I did. All right, before we go, I wanted to do, uh, [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3141.12s)]
*  I want to do my awards that I handed in on Tuesday. Not expecting, uh, I thought I had a little more [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3145.68s)]
*  time. I thought so too, but they asked for it on Tuesday. I think they didn't want the play in game. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3152.0s)]
*  So I'm just going to, I'm going to tell you what I did and you guys, I don't think I, [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3157.84s)]
*  neither of you guys know anything I did, right? No. Okay. I can guess based on some of your more [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3163.04s)]
*  recent podcast appearances. Oh, coach of the year, Bickerstaff three, Kenny Atkinson two. Whoa. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3168.16s)]
*  Mark Dagnall number one. Okay. Dagnall's been great. Who'd you have Rob? I did Atkinson one, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3179.84s)]
*  uh, Imu Doka two, Bickerstaff three, but Dagnall's been great. Ty Lue has been great. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3188.08s)]
*  I think Dagnall in particular balancing all the injuries that OKC had this season, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3192.96s)]
*  maintaining an elite high effort, high intensity defense over the entire course of the, of the run [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3198.0s)]
*  and helping their young players get better. That's just not something that a lot of coaches can do [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3203.2000000000003s)]
*  all at once. So he deserves a ton of credit. I was always impressed watching them, how well [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3207.2s)]
*  prepared they were, how hard they played and how they could basically sustain any injury. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3212.08s)]
*  And it was somehow okay. Uh, but the way the young players have grown on that team [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3218.3199999999997s)]
*  and it's got to the point where the trade deadline, it's like, I don't know. Aaron Wiggins is good. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3223.52s)]
*  Why would they, why do they need like a swing man? Why do they need Deandre Hunter? Like they have [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3227.4399999999996s)]
*  Aaron Wiggins. Uh, I just thought he did a great job and I think sometimes we default toward, [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3232.24s)]
*  it's gotta be this, you know, like a Bickerstaff or like a JJ the Lakers only improved by three. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3238.16s)]
*  It's almost most improved team because coach of the year kind of thing. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3243.2799999999997s)]
*  And I always felt like that was stupid. So anyway, I have that clutch player of the year, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3246.72s)]
*  Jason Tatum, number three, look up the stats. Sure. No. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3253.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3257.28s)]
*  Jalen Brunson. He's still only 19 years old, Chris. Uh, Jalen Brunson too. I couldn't believe how easy [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3258.32s)]
*  this was for me because I actually watched basketball. Yocage is the number one clutch [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3265.6s)]
*  player of the year. Does anyone fucking watch the nuggets? He does everything at the end of games [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3269.84s)]
*  for them, everything possible. How is he not clutch player of the year? Because this award [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3274.32s)]
*  is kind of bogus. That's a ridiculous word. They should get rid of it. It's reliant on how you parse [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3280.48s)]
*  12 shots. Like that's what the clutch player of the year is. We talked about other possible things [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3285.76s)]
*  that could, Rossella and I, that could go in for this award. Cause I hate the Kia clutch player of [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3291.92s)]
*  the year and I think it's stupid, but it could be like the, an award like the Kia. I'd really given [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3296.1600000000003s)]
*  up on you, but you kind of won me back over player of the year. Like I really think they should have [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3302.4s)]
*  something like that. Or I really thought you sucked and it turns out you don't. How do you think Kia [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3307.44s)]
*  would feel about that? Yeah. Well, yeah. Does that fit on a poster for them? Yeah. Sixth man of the year, [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3312.32s)]
*  Ty Jerome third, Peyton Pritchard second and Malik Beasley first. And I can't believe Pritchard [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3319.52s)]
*  was favored for this award all year. I just, what Beasley did all year, clearly the sixth man to me. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3325.6800000000003s)]
*  He didn't start really ever. He scored 16 a game. Kurt Goldsberry did a thing on my pod about how [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3331.52s)]
*  he's basically Klay Thompson for them this year. And I just thought it was a no brainer. Who'd you [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3338.64s)]
*  have for that rep? I had Pritchard. I think Pritchard does a lot of what Beasley does at a more or less [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3344.48s)]
*  similar level, not quite the three point volume. What Beasley is doing is pretty, pretty exceptional [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3350.08s)]
*  in that way, but a great three point shooter himself plus holds his own defensively. Plus drives [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3354.7999999999997s)]
*  offense off the dribble. I just think he's more versatile than Beasley at the end of the day. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3360.7999999999997s)]
*  CR, my thinking was if Pritchard disappeared for 25 games, it would suck, but the Celtics would [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3365.36s)]
*  have been fine. If Beasley disappeared, I think the Pistons would have been in major, major, [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3371.68s)]
*  major trouble because they actually ran real offense for him throughout the game. Also, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3376.16s)]
*  if you'd pick Pritchard, most people would have thrown their phones into a river by now. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3380.08s)]
*  Now look, man, I really care about these awards. I try to do the right thing, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3384.2400000000002s)]
*  even if it's at the expense of Pritch, please. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3388.32s)]
*  Please tell me that's not a thing. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3391.12s)]
*  Ah, that's t-shirt in Boston. Yeah. You can look for it. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3394.16s)]
*  Tastefully done, I'm sure. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3396.88s)]
*  I didn't see that over there. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3398.3199999999997s)]
*  Pritch Beasley is the hottest selling t-shirt in Boston. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3399.52s)]
*  Not a lot of Pritch, please shirts at the Coolidge. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3401.7599999999998s)]
*  I could get you one, CR. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3403.8399999999997s)]
*  Thanks, please. I'm a medium. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3404.88s)]
*  Rookie of the year. I went Castle one, Risa Shade two, ED three. I don't... [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3406.7999999999997s)]
*  Castle did enough, I feel like. Yeah, he was out there. Any arguments, CR? [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3412.4s)]
*  No, I mean, the Castle thing is just so exciting to imagine him with a healthy Wemby, Fox, full [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3418.0s)]
*  off-season, and then maybe an addition that they make in the off-season. It's really cool. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3424.56s)]
*  He's a perfect winning basketball player on that team. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3429.04s)]
*  I'll skip the rookie for second team. Most improved. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3433.6s)]
*  I did Kamara on Portland number three. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3438.32s)]
*  Really? [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3441.12s)]
*  I thought he was stunning. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3442.32s)]
*  I mean, he's been great, but he's kind of always been great at those things, though. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3444.48s)]
*  I get... Yeah, I really took this one seriously and looked at everybody's... [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3448.16s)]
*  Because I wanted to do Reeves and I looked at last year's Reeves versus this year and it's like, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3452.32s)]
*  was he really improved? He was good last year. Same thing for Cade. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3456.16s)]
*  Kamara became, I think, a guy that the other team was like, fuck. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3459.6s)]
*  That is true. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3463.52s)]
*  They have this guy. Oh man, this is going to be a hard night for me. So I had him three. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3464.4s)]
*  I had Christian Brown too, just getting thrown in the KCP thing. And then I thought Daniels [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3467.84s)]
*  was the clear number one. Who'd you have number one, Rob? [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3472.56s)]
*  I had Zou actually, number one. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3475.2s)]
*  Oh, I looked at him. I just felt like he was good last year and then went up a level, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3477.12s)]
*  but he's coming up later. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3482.08s)]
*  He was good, but I wouldn't have put him anywhere close to all defense last year, for example. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3483.2799999999997s)]
*  I thought he was really solid, but now he's all defense. Now he's putting up massive numbers. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3488.24s)]
*  Now he's still one of the most impactful rebounders in the league, but has taken [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3491.7599999999998s)]
*  an even bigger jump in terms of what that means to a team. I just think he's been incredible. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3495.2799999999997s)]
*  I wanted to put Quinton Grimes, number one for CR because he almost ruined CR's draft pick. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3500.08s)]
*  Oh my God, dude. Every night it was like, I was home in Philly watching a run of games that they [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3504.56s)]
*  had and he would honestly be going nuclear and you'd be like, all right, Quinton, roll an ankle. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3510.72s)]
*  You've done enough. You hit your over or whatever the hell is going on. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3518.16s)]
*  Anything? [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3521.68s)]
*  Defensive player of the year. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3524.16s)]
*  Number three, Draymond Green. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3526.88s)]
*  Okay. I'm feeling better. I'm worried. I'm worried where you're going, but I have hope. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3528.96s)]
*  Number two, Evan Mobley. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3533.8399999999997s)]
*  Oh, fuck. We couldn't get Evan Mobley number one. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3535.68s)]
*  Number one, Lou Dort. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3539.6s)]
*  Should have known. Lou Dort's great. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3542.96s)]
*  I looked at it every which way and I thought I was going, I thought it was really hard. And by the [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3543.8399999999997s)]
*  way, there's no Wemby this year. So this was like an Oscars year where you just take out Titanic out [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3549.04s)]
*  of 1997 and then try to figure out what best picture is. I just thought Dort was the best [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3554.32s)]
*  guy I saw in person this year. And I think he wrecked the most games that I saw as good as [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3560.2400000000002s)]
*  Mobley as Mobley like very looked like facsimile KG a lot of the times and can guard all these [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3567.36s)]
*  different things. I thought what Dort did to some of the best players in the league was unbelievable. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3572.8s)]
*  And I saw it in person a couple of times, hard and wanted no part of him. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3577.44s)]
*  No one does. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3582.4s)]
*  No, it's just like, he's just like this. He's like Revis on the jets. Just like, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3583.36s)]
*  all right, I'm going to take that guy. You guys worry about what you're going to do. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3589.0400000000004s)]
*  This guy's not doing anything today. And I just thought he was awesome. I voted for smart a couple [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3592.2400000000002s)]
*  years ago, which became a controversial pick after the pen. And it's a lot of the same stuff. Like, [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3596.96s)]
*  I just think perimeter guys who can make sure the other best guy in the team doesn't hit 30 in the [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3601.84s)]
*  game, which he had a two and a half month stretch where nobody scored 30 on him. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3608.4s)]
*  So I had him. So Rob, you had Mobley? I had Mobley. Yeah. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3612.96s)]
*  Where did you have Amen? [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3616.8s)]
*  That was a team, right? All defense, second team. Yeah, that I had him second team and I'm already [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3619.84s)]
*  regretting it, but I'll tell you what I did for the. So I had first team, all defense. I had [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3625.04s)]
*  Mobley, Green, Dort, Dyson, Daniels. I felt like had to be the poke check shit he was doing. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3629.36s)]
*  Nobody's done that in 40 years. I've never, and the one thing I didn't love about him was the big [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3635.92s)]
*  physical guys. I felt like I could overpower them a little bit, but everything else was there. And [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3641.04s)]
*  then I put, I put Zubot's first team. Yeah, why not? Yeah. I thought their whole defense is anchored [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3644.96s)]
*  toward funneling people to him, the rebounding, which I think should matter at least a little [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3651.6800000000003s)]
*  bit in all defense, protecting the boards. And, and I like to have my teams look like a semblance [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3655.84s)]
*  of a team. I know these are all fake teams, but they're extremely fake. They're extremely stupid [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3662.56s)]
*  and fake, but I like that. I want them to look like a team. So then second team, Kamara, Ananobe, [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3668.56s)]
*  Amen Thompson, Jaylen Williams, and I had Giannis over Go Bear. I just felt like we skip over Giannis [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3674.56s)]
*  every year with all defense for some reason. Then you watch these games and he's all over the place. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3681.44s)]
*  So JJJ not in either then? Neither. Damn, none. I think he's in the group that could have like [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3685.2s)]
*  a first team argument. I think, you know, it's, it's on that borderline where you're either going [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3692.08s)]
*  to go on then Jaren Jackson, Zoo, someone in that category, but I think he's, I think he's got to be [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3695.7599999999998s)]
*  there. I think he's got to be their second team. Sorry, go ahead. Stay in the fucking court. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3701.68s)]
*  I've watched too many games or he does the dumbest foul. He did it in the playing game. He does [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3708.72s)]
*  dumbest fouls at the worst time. And I think that's a huge part of this. Zubot stays on the court. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3712.88s)]
*  That is true. Zubot says like 2.1 fouls a game and Jackson will be, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3717.12s)]
*  he'll have any big game and watch in the playing game. I'm sure it'll be the same thing. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3720.8s)]
*  He's always lingering around foul trouble. Foul on dudes, 20 feet from the basket. What do you have, [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3724.8s)]
*  CR? I was just going to say in honor of your Kia, I thought you sucked, but you actually impressed me [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3730.0s)]
*  this year award or changing that title. I think we could do the Kia. I like watching you play defense [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3735.04s)]
*  more than I like watching most guys play offense team. Now we're talking. I like watching Ahman [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3742.0s)]
*  play defense more than I like watching like 80% of guys play basketball. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3749.52s)]
*  he's weird a word to have athlete of the year in the NBA, but for me he's athlete of the year. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3755.52s)]
*  That's the over and over again when people see Houston in person, they're like, Jesus, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3762.24s)]
*  it's really jarring. What happened to this guy? Okay. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3766.56s)]
*  Oh, NBA first team, Shay, Yoko, Jatum, Giannis, Mitchell. You knew those were the five. Second [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3771.6s)]
*  team Edwards, Curry, Mobley, Towns, LeBron James. There's some cases against LeBron because of the [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3777.36s)]
*  net rating, Rob. Like he had a net minus 1.3 net rating on a team that won 50 games. Does that, [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3789.6s)]
*  do you care about that stuff when you look at boats? I think you have to flag it and kind of [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3794.96s)]
*  kick the tires on it, but ultimately circle back to the fact that this is LeBron James and you can, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3799.28s)]
*  you can see so much of the impact he has on the game. He's not a subtle player. Like he has the [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3804.4s)]
*  ball a lot. He makes incredible plays that no one else can make. I think it's worth looking at, [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3808.56s)]
*  but the Lakers rotation has been so funky all year. I think there's just a lot of noise in it, [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3813.52s)]
*  to be honest with you. Yeah. And see, I was like, it was just a goofy season. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3816.96s)]
*  Davis gets hurt. They make a trade mid season and he was, you know, the only constant. So you're [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3822.0s)]
*  good with LeBron second team? Yeah. And I think that you should almost give him credit for the, [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3827.2799999999997s)]
*  the adaptability that he's had. Definitely. Like to be, some nights he has to be the man. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3832.64s)]
*  Some nights he's like playing setup guy for Luca. He's weathered all these different storms and he's [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3837.52s)]
*  actually been like pretty healthy for a 40 year old. And when he's been on the court, he's looked [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3842.8s)]
*  awesome. Every time I want to heap praise on him, he does stuff like saying how he was in the bottom [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3847.04s)]
*  half of the league with free throws over the last, whatever that thing he said on McAfee was easily [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3851.84s)]
*  debunked. Or then Rich Paul goes in and talks about how the three guys in Miami weren't actually a big [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3856.72s)]
*  three. If you look at it, it's like, yeah, they were. Basher was like a 24 and 10 guy in his own [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3862.56s)]
*  team. It was a big three dude. The constant trying to push this goat agenda with LeBron. It's, it's, [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3866.8s)]
*  they're making it worse, not better. I'll just say that. Okay. NBA 13, Cade Cunningham and Brunson, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3873.76s)]
*  no surprise. The last three spots were pretty divisive all over the place. And a lot of people [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3882.0s)]
*  had Hal Burton and, and, uh, Jaren Jackson here. Neither of them made my list. Come on. Why? Jalen [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3888.88s)]
*  Williams. Okay. See sure. Yeah. Zoo bots. Okay. I put them on. I like that because I, I just look, [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3896.72s)]
*  the NBA does this thing where they're, they've just like, there's too much controversy with these, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3905.52s)]
*  with the NBA teams, just pick 15 best players. And it's like, I don't want to do that. You're [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3910.3999999999996s)]
*  throwing away 80 years of history by doing that. I still think I have to have a big man on every [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3916.0s)]
*  team. And if, if there's no big man, then sure, I'll have four guards. But if there's somebody [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3921.68s)]
*  who deserves to be on it, I'm just picking them over having four guards. I thought zoo bots, [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3926.0s)]
*  I made the case for him Sunday. I thought he was amazing and incredibly important. And, um, [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3930.4s)]
*  it was a good litmus test of, are you watching basketball or not this season? [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3935.6s)]
*  So that last spot came down to James Harden or Tyrese Hal Burton for me. And I can't believe it. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3938.96s)]
*  I took James Harden. Incredible. Can I ask you a question? I have two Clippers on my third team. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3944.88s)]
*  Do you think it's just funny to cost Steve Ballmer a lot of money? Cause these guys probably will [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3950.16s)]
*  do that. Like bonuses. I didn't even, I didn't know about that. Um, I just thought Harden, [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3955.7599999999998s)]
*  I watched, I really liked the Pacers, but there are some Pacers games where he just wasn't, [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3961.6s)]
*  didn't have to be that important. First couple months of the season, wasn't great. Last three, [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3966.56s)]
*  four months, he was way, way better. Really good. Definitely. Harden does everything for the [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3971.04s)]
*  Clippers. Even when Kawhi's out there, everything's still running through him. And he was really [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3975.52s)]
*  durable. He played like 78, 79 games. And, uh, I just thought he was really, really good. I had a [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3979.36s)]
*  lot of, I couldn't leave them off. So Rob, what are your take two Clippers? That's a lot of Clippers, [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3986.08s)]
*  even for a great Clippers season, especially at Hal Burton's expense, who will, it will surprise [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3991.6800000000003s)]
*  no one given my Pacers advocacy, uh, that I have Hal Burton. I actually have him on my second team. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=3996.7200000000003s)]
*  Wow. He is the style of play for a 50 win team. Yeah. Like that's, that's a pretty compelling [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4002.48s)]
*  case. He doesn't have a straightforward one-on-one game and that makes him kind of a funky player, [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4009.12s)]
*  but he has a comprehensive winning effect on everything that's happening around him. And [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4014.72s)]
*  Harden has some of that too. I want to be fair, like Harden handling and shouldering as much as [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4018.8s)]
*  he did is what lets you play Chris Dunn as much as you do. It's what lets you play Derek Jones Jr. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4023.92s)]
*  as much as you do. It's what lets you get away with all these other guys slotting into their roles. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4028.48s)]
*  And so the usage kind of efficiency trade-offs of that are not always going to look great for [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4032.48s)]
*  Harden, but the impact is there and it's substantial. But him and Zou over Hal Burton, [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4036.48s)]
*  I think the only way to do it is to do what you did, which is construct an entirely new set of [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4043.2s)]
*  rules by which you need to put a center on the team to make it look like an actual basketball team. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4047.76s)]
*  Yeah. And if it was going to go, you know, Hey, do whatever, then I probably would have done [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4051.6s)]
*  Hal Burton and Harden, but I really, I genuinely think Zoubotz deserves it. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4056.4s)]
*  Those are the rules are do whatever, but they're not his rules. That's true. Look, [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4060.96s)]
*  a man's got to have a code. Those weren't the rules in 1973. Those weren't the rules in 1997. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4065.6s)]
*  I'm trying to move America forward. You know, we're trying to. Bill's keeping the positions of all [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4072.32s)]
*  NBA and we're going to start smoking inside a restaurant. We'll start messing around with [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4077.6s)]
*  the constitution. All of a sudden Trump's in there for multiple terms. What could go wrong? [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4080.88s)]
*  Um, I felt really bad about Hal Burton. I had basically 16 guys for 15 spots. Jackson wasn't [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4086.56s)]
*  going to make it for me, but Hal Burton, um, so that's it. I'll probably maybe regret it. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4091.44s)]
*  All right. MVP last one. I put Mitchell five. I test drove the Edwards case and I test drove [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4096.16s)]
*  the Curry case. Did you do similar test drives Rob? Uh, for Curry more than Edwards. I think [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4104.4s)]
*  Ant for me is like maybe, maybe a slight cut below these guys. Tatum four. He was three for me most [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4108.96s)]
*  of the year, but I thought Yannis, whatever happened to him the last month was just out of [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4115.36s)]
*  control and he's just had to be three. I mean, especially when Dame goes out and it just didn't [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4119.28s)]
*  matter for them. So Mitchell Tatum, Yannis, and then I battled back and forth when Yokech and Shay [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4123.28s)]
*  and I changed my mind a hundred times. And I really don't think there's a wrong answer [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4129.44s)]
*  because Shay had one of the best seasons by a guard probably in the last 40 years. When you're [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4134.88s)]
*  talking about his offensive production, the consistency, how he did against teams head to [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4142.24s)]
*  head, what he meant to a pretty young but incredibly deep OKC team and the fact that they won 68 games. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4146.88s)]
*  Like I, I just thought he was an incredible candidate and probably would have taken easily [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4154.719999999999s)]
*  80% of the seasons. And I think he's going to win this year. Anyway, I voted for Yokech. Um, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4160.719999999999s)]
*  I thought it was the best offensive season I've seen since Jordan. Like for what somebody did [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4167.36s)]
*  game after game, quarter after quarter, all the shit that he did for that team. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4176.5599999999995s)]
*  Not only was he first of all, to be top three in points, rebounds and assists is it's bonkers. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4182.0s)]
*  I just can't believe, but not trying to pad stats, not doing the shit Westbrook did in 2017 where [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4188.639999999999s)]
*  can you box out so I can get this foul shot rebound and all that stuff. His usage rates, [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4195.44s)]
*  not that high. So if you're going to compare it to Luca last year, like Luca had the ball all the [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4199.919999999999s)]
*  time last year, Yokech kind of has the ball to necessity, but he wants the ball to keep moving [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4204.32s)]
*  almost like a hockey player. Um, I thought the stuff he did day to day, week to week, [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4208.96s)]
*  I I've never seen anything like it. And I w I was leaning there, leaning there. And then that 60, [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4214.5599999999995s)]
*  10 game, I just, I was like, this is, we're, we may never see anything like this again. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4220.08s)]
*  And I just had to pick them. So that's where I landed. I felt like just the fact that he'd won [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4228.24s)]
*  before would be the only reason I get it. Shay with the wins. I mean, there's great cases for [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4232.8s)]
*  Shay. I didn't like making a pick and I'll probably regret it a week from now, but I just feel like [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4237.12s)]
*  I'm never going to see a season like that again. He got 50 games. They were in a three-way tie for [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4241.68s)]
*  the third spot in the West, which was really competitive. The coach GM situation was a [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4246.48s)]
*  catastrophe. Murray didn't show up for the first two months of the season. They had no bench. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4251.04s)]
*  The advanced metrics for when he was on the court, when he was off the court was the biggest [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4256.5599999999995s)]
*  disparity in the history of the league. And it's just like, at some point, what are we doing? [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4260.799999999999s)]
*  So I took them. What are your, what's your takes here? Well, I want to ask you whether or not you [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4265.36s)]
*  think you might regret it in two months if Oklahoma city loses like two games in the playoffs. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4269.44s)]
*  Yeah, if they go 16 and two. And because I know it's a regular season award, but like, how will it [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4276.08s)]
*  sit if Shay is leading this historically good Oklahoma city team to their first title and he [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4281.04s)]
*  is like, it's me. Like I am him, you know, like you guys are worried about Luca and LeBron. I feel [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4288.48s)]
*  stupid, right? But, but, but it's a regular season award. That's the thing. And, and the thing is [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4293.919999999999s)]
*  Shay was incredible. I almost feel like it's not, it's not even like a, like a slap on him. He had, [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4299.52s)]
*  he had like a better season than any Kobe Bryant season. He had as good of a season as any season [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4306.400000000001s)]
*  Jordan ever had statistically when you look at the wins and all the other stuff. But I just, [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4312.0s)]
*  the Yokelich thing I thought was like a fucking unicorn season. Rob, what's your take? [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4317.280000000001s)]
*  I also voted Yokelich. I think Shay did, as you said, every single thing you need to do to win MVP. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4322.080000000001s)]
*  But sometimes you play at the same time as Nicola Yokelich. And I mean, this is where every voter is [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4328.72s)]
*  so different for me. If you are definitively the best player in the world and Yokelich is [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4333.360000000001s)]
*  having a season representative of being the best player in the world, I kind of start there and [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4338.400000000001s)]
*  you have to have the burden of proof to overcome it. And I think Shay got as close as I can imagine [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4343.360000000001s)]
*  a player possibly getting with the season that Yokelich had, like that is an incredibly compelling [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4348.0s)]
*  case. What the Thunder overall, a 68 win team, how dominant their defense was and his role in that, [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4352.08s)]
*  especially juxtaposed with Yokelich who has not been good defensively all season. But the way that [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4358.32s)]
*  Yokelich carries that team is totally unique. And overall his production, I think is just something [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4363.12s)]
*  that is really, really hard to talk your way around around or out of. And so I don't feel great about [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4367.92s)]
*  it, but I also don't think I'm ever going to be at the point where I'm losing sleep over voting for [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4374.32s)]
*  Yokelich for MVP. As long as he's playing like this, I'm going to be at peace with that. Even if it [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4378.639999999999s)]
*  means someone who also very well could have, and I think will be MVP was not number one on my ballot. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4383.5199999999995s)]
*  It feels like Yokelich has moved into the Jordan Lebron zone where he's MVP every year. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4388.719999999999s)]
*  And it's really up to the voters to be like, I'm bored or something has happened that feels like [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4393.44s)]
*  lightning in a bottle. You could tell me that next season Shay's not in the top three for NBA voting, [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4398.799999999999s)]
*  MVP voting. And I wouldn't be shocked, right? But I would be if Yokelich wasn't. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4405.12s)]
*  Well, like Lebron was in the zone from 09 to 13. He won four or five. And then that Miami season, [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4409.84s)]
*  the first one was the one he didn't win. But it was just like when he was on that level that he was at, [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4416.16s)]
*  nobody was taking the MVP from him as long as his team was winning enough games. And then [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4421.599999999999s)]
*  he went to Cleveland. I think the one Lebron season you could probably make the case after 13 [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4426.0s)]
*  was that last Cleveland season when he played 82. His stats really good. But if you go back and [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4431.12s)]
*  look like Harden, Harden's team won 65 games and his stats were basically dead even with Lebron. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4436.4s)]
*  He was a better pick. Well, the one quirk in that, though, was that Lebron was the best player in the [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4441.44s)]
*  league and did have that acclaim and Derek Rose won. And this look, Shay is complicated. This is [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4445.599999999999s)]
*  not that Shay is absolutely worthy and not just like a narratively driven winner. Like he has [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4452.16s)]
*  every literally everything you would want on the resume. And I think going to get head to head [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4457.599999999999s)]
*  against other good teams like he did it. He was an incredible. But I kept coming back like I did. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4461.84s)]
*  You did the ringer 100, right? Yeah. So I had OKC. I had them. I had Shay too. 17, 18, 62, 65, 79 and 96. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4466.88s)]
*  I had them with seven of the best 96 guys in Denver. I had one 41, 60 and 78. And I'm not even [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4477.6s)]
*  sure how good I feel about the 78, which is Porter. I haven't, that might've been even a little bit too [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4485.52s)]
*  high. And then you think like, no, I'm just like, I don't, I don't know. I don't know how much I like [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4491.76s)]
*  Porter. And then you throw in the bench, which is like every 30 seconds he wasn't in the game. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4496.72s)]
*  You felt like Denver was going to fall apart. I thought it was historic season. I feel terrible. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4503.4400000000005s)]
*  And I, I that, that I didn't vote for Shay because Shay did every single thing you ever could have [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4508.400000000001s)]
*  asked. I just think Yokoj's position is more important if you're going to look at it to be [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4513.76s)]
*  like a point center that is also the best rebounder. He did everything, but he not only [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4518.48s)]
*  made the meals for his team, but he like spoon fed them teammate by teammate. I've never seen [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4523.599999999999s)]
*  anything like it. And when he was out, they were eating gruel. Like they were eating. Yeah. They [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4528.959999999999s)]
*  moved to prison food. So we'll see. Yokoj could lose in five games in round one and it could be a [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4533.759999999999s)]
*  2007 dirt situation. But Bill, you said you had seven thunder players on your top 100 ballot. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4539.919999999999s)]
*  Is Aaron Wiggins one of those players? No, but Kason Wallace was. Oh, I love Kason Wallace. Yeah. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4545.68s)]
*  Okay. Now we're talking. Yeah. Cause I just feel like if Kason Wallace was on another team, [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4550.400000000001s)]
*  that's a 35 minute a game guy for 25 other teams in the league. He's like a luxury for them. Maybe [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4555.360000000001s)]
*  their third or fourth best defender, which I think is a real state in terms of what the fuck they are. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4563.68s)]
*  If you're going to ding shape or anything, I don't even know if it's a ding. That team is so, [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4568.72s)]
*  they were missing like heart and steam was out for a while. Chet missed two thirds of the season. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4573.599999999999s)]
*  Like I get it. But when you just like, like fundamentally that team is built so perfectly [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4577.84s)]
*  for them where they can lose any two guys for a game and it's still okay. They can guard [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4582.96s)]
*  everybody in every conceivable way. And Shae just really has to worry about, [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4588.16s)]
*  I just got a score for us in crunch time. This is my job. And he was awesome at it. Yep. But man, [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4593.2s)]
*  that Yoke-age season. One of the things about the Yoke-age case too, that I've seen going around, [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4600.320000000001s)]
*  like I get that the Thunder ran away with the West and they deserve credit for that. And she [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4604.56s)]
*  deserves credit for that. When was a 50 win season not good enough to win MVP? [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4609.4400000000005s)]
*  Never. I mean, to be, you want to be in the top four seeds. I think if the Denver had fallen to [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4615.280000000001s)]
*  like a seven seed, I think it gets a little dicer. I know everybody was split by a game, but still, [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4620.320000000001s)]
*  you know, the West was the West had what eight, eight of the best 11 teams in the league basically [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4625.2s)]
*  in Indiana and most of the good players in the league. So, all right, CR. I thought you'd, [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4633.2s)]
*  I thought CR would be more upset. CR, who'd you have? Shae or Yoke-age? You didn't tell us. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4639.28s)]
*  I have Shae, but it was only just because I, I kind of have a weird feeling that like [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4643.12s)]
*  Oklahoma could just like run away with this. This might not be a very close postseason. I think [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4649.599999999999s)]
*  they're so far away, the best team I've watched this year. And we haven't had one of those in a [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4654.96s)]
*  while where it's just like, Whoa, this train just like left the station. So I think that in honor of [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4660.48s)]
*  that, there's nothing against Yoke-age. Yoke-age played the one of the best basketball games I've [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4666.0s)]
*  ever seen in my life was that 60 point game. But I just feel like it was Shae's year. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4670.32s)]
*  I think OKC gets to the finals unless I think the Clippers are the only team that has a chance [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4676.08s)]
*  against them. I think they beat everybody else. I think they're just going to win. I think, [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4681.12s)]
*  I think this is their year. It certainly feels like it, especially if Jalen Brown isn't a 100% [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4684.24s)]
*  Jalen Brown and they play Boston in a finals where they have home court. And it's an 80% Jalen Brown [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4689.599999999999s)]
*  and first them versus Cleveland. I would just take them 10 out of 10 times. Anyway, Mahoney, CR, [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4697.44s)]

*  that we know what's happened in the next two days, but we don't know what's happened. For all I know, [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4806.88s)]
*  Joss scored 56 tonight. Tonight was the greatest day of basketball we ever had. Joss [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4811.92s)]
*  rescued his reputation tonight and pushed the Warriors to the thunder. And what I'm trying [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4816.56s)]
*  to do here is sound smart as something like that happens. Joss retired the grenade celebration [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4821.68s)]
*  and had a 70 point game. So I want to dive into your life, which I'm fascinated by. You're in LA, [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4826.16s)]
*  but you're doing get up. And you told, what time did you get up? Did you get up? I get up at like [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4833.76s)]
*  3 41 a.m. when I'm here. When I'm doing get up. Not every day. What's your normal time zone? [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4840.0s)]
*  Central time zone. Okay, so you're two hours, but three hours behind ET. I love doing get up. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4845.44s)]
*  It's such a fun show to do. I'm not just saying that, I swear. I love working with Green Bird. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4854.24s)]

*  you know, so whatever. But it is hard to, like tonight, it's going to be a struggle to stay up [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4866.879999999999s)]
*  for this. Like I'll be struggling in the fourth quarter. So you, you wake up [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4872.24s)]
*  quick shower just to wake up. Are you getting coffee? Like what's your move? I don't drink coffee. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4878.48s)]
*  I don't, I don't drink coffee. So that's a problem. Okay. I get up. Do you have to put like self [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4882.4s)]
*  makeup? No. Well, it's a good question. See, this year in the business. So I do put on self makeup. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4887.599999999999s)]
*  The makeup artists come about 6 a.m. as they're starting your show, starting around then. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4894.639999999999s)]
*  Um, but I put on some powder at like 4 45. Yeah. Yeah. That was, I remember my friend, [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4899.12s)]
*  Rob Stone, who works for a, does a bunch of stuff for Fox. I've known forever. They, ESPN let us do [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4906.4s)]
*  a college basketball game once at Pepperdine. Amazing. And it was like in the mid 2000s and [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4911.759999999999s)]
*  we get there and we're about to go on. He pulls out this thing and he's doing this and I'm like, [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4918.5599999999995s)]
*  what are you doing? And he's like, I'm powdering up. Do you want some? I'm like, no. And he's like, [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4922.719999999999s)]
*  well, you're going to regret it. And then he was right. Well, like the thing is like too much [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4926.96s)]
*  information. Like after I take a shower, I get like a red face. So I've got to, I got to do it. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4931.2s)]
*  I got to put on the powder. So I've got like a little compact with me and you put your little [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4935.12s)]
*  thing, your little head. And can you, are you on the delay? Cause that's always one of the hard [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4938.88s)]
*  things in those. No. So like I'm here in LA. We have a studio. I go into the studio. Oh, you go in. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4944.32s)]
*  Yeah. I walk. I mean, it's short distance from the hotel to the thing. Okay. I get it. But [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4950.08s)]
*  during this, the playoffs, I'll be doing it for my hotel room a lot. I choose hotel rooms. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4956.08s)]
*  I choose hotels in the playoffs based on when I can do a good morning TV setup. Like I know this [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4961.5199999999995s)]
*  is going to sound strange, but there was a hotel in Dallas last year that I picked because I did [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4967.2s)]
*  it in the Western conference finals. And I came back to the finals that I knew they had high chairs [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4972.799999999999s)]
*  in the lobby. I swiped, I came, I went to the bartender and said, Hey, can I borrow one of these [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4978.16s)]
*  chairs? Cause you know, you got to sit on a high chair. He didn't know where it was. Okay. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4982.24s)]
*  And I dragged it into the, like a bar chair into the elevator. I took it upstairs. They probably [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4987.12s)]
*  thought you were stealing it. Because you need to sit on a high chair. Yeah. You know, it doesn't [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4994.48s)]
*  look good when you're scrunched up. So you don't have that in the hotel room. So I, and I did it [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=4997.5199999999995s)]
*  in Minneapolis too. Like I, I like borrowed chairs and take them to my room. Like when I'm on the [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5003.28s)]
*  road in the playoffs doing get up and first take in the morning, like sometimes I'm at the arenas [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5008.48s)]
*  where they have setups, but on nights on days when I don't and I'm in a hotel, that's what I do. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5012.0s)]
*  But when I'm in LA, we have a studio. Well, and then you do, you attempt the craziest thing, [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5016.08s)]
*  which I have never done and will never do is doing actual content on the court after games. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5020.799999999999s)]
*  When people can interrupt you, Zach told me you could tell the story though. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5026.959999999999s)]
*  Somebody interrupted you and came in and had some amazing story and then it wasn't recording. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5031.839999999999s)]
*  Do you know where I am? So what was that story? So the Dan Hurley thing had just gone down. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5036.24s)]
*  He came out here to Lakers and got a new contract. It was after one of the games in Boston. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5041.76s)]
*  Had to have been like game two. Okay. And Zach and I are on the court and Gino is, Gino walks past, [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5048.16s)]
*  because you know, you're doing on the court, just live, like we're constantly grabbing people who [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5056.16s)]
*  are walking by. Gino walks by, says hello to us, we're recording. Okay. And he had just signed a [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5059.52s)]
*  new contract. And I made this joke. I was like, Hey, congrats on your new contract. I was a little [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5067.6s)]
*  worried they might not retain you. Right. Make a joke. He goes, yeah, I should have, somebody, [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5072.56s)]
*  there was a job open. Oh, it was a Cleveland job. He goes, yeah, I should have pretended like I was [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5078.160000000001s)]
*  going to go to the Cavs. I could have got more money. Like only half joking. I mean, maybe he [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5081.76s)]
*  was fully joking. I don't know, but it was like an amazing, it was an amazing moment. Like, oh my [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5089.36s)]
*  God, I think he just took like a soft shot at Dan Hurley or maybe a hard shot. I don't know. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5095.599999999999s)]
*  And then like two minutes later, Cedric Maxwell walks by and he's always good for talking shit [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5102.5599999999995s)]
*  about the Lakers. And you know, I think Boston got up too well and I prompted him to talk some [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5110.48s)]
*  trash, which he did, which is always great. Like this is now like multiple finals in a [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5117.04s)]
*  row where I've gotten max to do this. It's almost like a trope. He knows they all know Zach and I [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5122.72s)]
*  are sitting there with microphones. They all know what's going on. And so he makes like some sort [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5127.28s)]
*  of passing comment, making fun of the Lakers or James Worthy. And he keeps on walking and he [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5131.12s)]
*  walks because you know, there's, there's wires on the ground. He walks through the wires and he pulls [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5136.48s)]
*  it and the recorder goes flying onto the court, explodes open things. When you lose everything. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5144.24s)]
*  We lost everything. Oh my God. So that's like my worst nightmare. Yeah. I mean, and you know, [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5150.4s)]
*  Zach, like Zach doesn't do the second take. He was ready to like, he was ready to walk. He's like, [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5155.76s)]
*  we're just not going to do it tonight. I go, no Zach. So we have game two of the finals. We need [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5162.8s)]
*  to do it. So yeah, that happened. It's been really fun for me to watch your, your, your, I don't know, [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5167.2s)]
*  I don't want to say rise, but like whatever the journey has been where you're now. Thank you for [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5173.76s)]
*  letting me have the Larry Bird cup. I did. I wasn't sure I should take it. Watching the rise. We talked [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5178.56s)]
*  about, or the journey we talked. You came on after the, the Utah thing. Yeah. The finger point, [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5184.88s)]
*  which is still going. Get up is still milking that as a gimmick for you. And then milked everywhere [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5192.56s)]
*  across the country where I go. But then last year you did the Luca thing during the finals, [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5198.320000000001s)]
*  which I immediately took seriously. Cause I've known you for a long time and I don't think you [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5202.08s)]
*  do stuff like that lightly. Right. And it felt like there was real thought put into it for a [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5206.5599999999995s)]
*  bunch of different reasons. And you were just like, fuck it. I'm doing this right now. I have [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5212.0s)]
*  all this different Intel I'm getting. I was at the same game you were. And I thought Luca really [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5217.44s)]
*  screwed the game up and just was acting like a brat that game. I'm pro Luca by the way. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5222.8s)]
*  But he was bratty and he really hurt them that game. And then you just said, fuck it and went [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5227.5199999999995s)]
*  for it. I was angry because the finals were over. He, you know, he found out of this game [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5231.52s)]
*  and the finals were over. And I thought it could have been a good series. Yeah. And the reason [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5237.360000000001s)]
*  that I was having that visceral reaction was because I'd seen him do it before it was an [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5243.040000000001s)]
*  international play two other times in his career. He got disqualified from essentially an elimination. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5246.4800000000005s)]
*  It wasn't an elimination game, which that was an elimination game. It happened when he was on the [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5252.56s)]
*  Slovenian national team. One time he fouled out because he got a technical foul, which in international [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5256.96s)]
*  competition counts as a personal foul. Right. And he fouled out on a technical like in the European, [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5265.52s)]
*  the Euro cup, the Euro basket, they call it. They were their defending champs. One of the great [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5271.44s)]
*  moments of his career, by the way, was winning Euro basket with Slovenia. Slovenia, it's laughable [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5275.28s)]
*  that they could win. Not laughable. It's impressive. I would say impossible. They won [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5282.32s)]
*  the European championship, like in the late teens. And then when they had their, they were defending [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5286.799999999999s)]
*  their title, he got ejected from the game. They got eliminated. It was ridiculous. And then in the, [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5291.04s)]
*  in the world cup in Philippines in 23, so a year earlier, he got thrown out of the quarterfinals. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5296.5599999999995s)]
*  Now they probably would have lost the game, but like in the middle of the game, [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5305.5199999999995s)]
*  he was angry at the officials and he went over to half court. This is in Manila, Philippines. I know [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5310.32s)]
*  nobody watched it. It was in the middle of the night and he is cursing out the secretary general [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5315.679999999999s)]
*  of FIBA. Like the free throws are going on. He comes down and curses out the secretary general [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5323.2s)]
*  in Spanish. I know because I was talking to people who were sitting next to secretary general. Yeah. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5330.24s)]
*  Who knows what he was saying, but can you imagine like in a game, like, cause you know where Adam [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5335.36s)]
*  Silver sits, secretary general was sitting kind of in the same spot, like midway up the deck. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5339.5199999999995s)]
*  Can you imagine like going over and cursing out Adam Silver because [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5344.24s)]
*  Scott Foster had just called a foul. Like it's, it's, it's ridiculous. And by the way, the idea [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5347.84s)]
*  that they would not want Luca Doncic and Slovenia advancing, that's it's a preposterous conspiracy. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5352.48s)]
*  And then a few minutes later, he got a second technical and got thrown out of the game. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5360.08s)]
*  I'm like, Luca, what are you doing? The only chance Slovenia has is if you're great, [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5364.400000000001s)]
*  how are you getting thrown out of these elimination games? So I didn't, I was, that was at least the [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5369.120000000001s)]
*  third time that I know of, and I don't know his whole career, that he had allowed himself to be [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5375.200000000001s)]
*  basically getting disqualified because the sixth foul was a preposterous foul. It was a ridiculous [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5380.080000000001s)]
*  foul and his behavior, the whole game was ridiculous. And so I was angry that I'd seen him for the third [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5385.68s)]
*  time, the second time in person in less than a year disqualified from an elimination game [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5391.6s)]
*  where he totally undercut his team. For, for just petulance. Yes. And I was, [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5397.4400000000005s)]
*  I was criticizing him obviously, but I was, the reason I was angry was because he's so much [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5405.92s)]
*  better than that. Yeah. And that's what I was saying. I was like, that's not winning. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5410.64s)]
*  You know, winning is what the Celtics are doing. This is what you're doing is losing. This is a [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5415.92s)]
*  losing mentality. And so, um, well, obviously the Mavericks agreed with you. Well, the people in [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5420.48s)]
*  Dallas did not agree with me because it was not the most fun next two days. I was going to say, [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5427.599999999999s)]
*  yeah, it's cause I don't remember if I saw you after that, but we were there for an off day. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5432.16s)]
*  And then came back and played great in game four. Yeah. Like play defense, like was focused and [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5437.759999999999s)]
*  people were like, Oh, he proved you wrong. And I was like, no, you're down three, one in the series. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5444.08s)]
*  It was upsetting because he could have played that way the whole time. And you know, what's funny [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5449.6s)]
*  about this, I will say, I don't remember what they, there's one day off in between games three and [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5455.12s)]
*  game four. It's the only time there's one day off in the finals. And so there was one day off in [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5460.56s)]
*  between. And then there was the whole pregame for game four. I was in the arena for many hours, [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5464.8s)]
*  the next two days and all kinds of Mavericks people were there. Front office people, coaching [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5470.56s)]
*  staff, executives, what have you. Nobody said anything. Nobody said, like nobody defended him. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5476.56s)]
*  Well, I don't, I mean, I'm not saying it was in there. I'm not saying they had to, [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5484.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm just saying like I was prepared to get blown back. And Jason Kidd said some stuff [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5487.84s)]
*  in the press conference. Like he was like defending Luca, which he should, [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5497.68s)]
*  but like, no, I was available. Like, if it's like, trust me, I get, when I say something that [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5501.84s)]
*  pisses people off, not every day, but you know, people will reach out to me. Like you were wrong [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5507.12s)]
*  about this. Well, especially at the finals, you're going to run into them the next day. So there's a [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5511.6s)]
*  heightened level of something. I mean, I did, at the time, I didn't think like, I wasn't like [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5516.32s)]
*  noticing, boy, no one's saying anything to me. I was like, well, they're down three, oh, and the [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5520.56s)]
*  series is over. They're not really in the. Well, I said, I said on one of the pods I did this week [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5523.84s)]
*  about Minnesota Lakers. I can't remember. I said it, my pod that I went on Zach's. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5530.0s)]
*  I really feel like Minnesota has a game plan in that series should be to mess with Luca and try [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5534.96s)]
*  to get him. I've watched him. I've watched it happen multiple times already in this Laker season. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5541.04s)]
*  He, for some reason, and I kind of, I gotta be honest, I kind of like it because it's almost [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5547.04s)]
*  like he almost seems Italian to me, even though it's Slovenian, but he just takes everything [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5551.68s)]
*  personally. If somebody talks shit to him, he can't believe it. And he'll just keep it going [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5555.84s)]
*  for five minutes. He'll talk to people in the first two rows. He'll get mad at a ref and keep [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5560.96s)]
*  going with the ref for 10 minutes. And then the thing that really bugs him, which is so funny, [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5566.8s)]
*  I think he's the only guy in the league that does this. If there's a foul on him, like somebody [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5572.16s)]
*  files him and the guy who found him is then turned into the ref and complaining about the thing. And [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5577.68s)]
*  Luca thinks it was a foul. He actually gets like offended and he'll get involved in the argument [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5582.48s)]
*  and he'll start and he'll just go back and forth. But he just said he plays with such a chip on his [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5589.04s)]
*  shoulder. I feel like you could use it against him. You look at Minnesota, they have Edwards, [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5593.5199999999995s)]
*  they have McDaniels, they have Alexander Walker, like Randall. They have some guys who can, [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5597.839999999999s)]
*  I think, mess with them. Well, I will say this. I've been talking to the guys who covered the [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5602.719999999999s)]
*  Mavericks. He's had ongoing feuds with individual fans for years. Like sometimes, no, no, [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5606.24s)]
*  on the road. Like there's, you know, cause he got into it with the guy in Oklahoma city two weeks ago. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5614.88s)]
*  Apparently that's not the first time those guys have gotten into it. Or if not, it was somebody [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5619.92s)]
*  nearby. Like he goes, I mean, like, actually I don't have a problem with him getting into it with [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5623.679999999999s)]
*  fans. I would rather him go back and forth with a fan or the opposing player as opposed to getting [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5628.96s)]
*  back in it with the refs. Cause he gets back and forth with the refs, he hurts his team. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5634.16s)]
*  Well, and they just get so fed up with them after a while too. Right. Well, that play, like he was [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5638.16s)]
*  incorrectly ejected from that game in Oklahoma city. Nobody would question that he was, obviously he [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5643.68s)]
*  was talking to the fan. But the ref, he played with JT Orr, had hurt, there was not even contact on [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5648.639999999999s)]
*  that play. He scored on the interior. There was no contact. There was nothing for him to really [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5654.639999999999s)]
*  complain about. But the ref has heard him for years. And he's used to, did you see what he did? [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5658.72s)]
*  He like wound up and gave him a baseball umpire. Get out of here. This is what happens with, with [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5663.76s)]
*  Draymond too. Like the refs, like they are so tired of hearing it that they, they- [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5669.280000000001s)]
*  There's one other guy that's, if you were doing the first team all NBA for this, [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5676.240000000001s)]
*  the sneaky guy in this team is Tatum. This is a running thing with him all year. He just, [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5680.64s)]
*  and you know, obviously I'm a Celtics fan. So I'm, I see his side on it. Cause I do feel like he gets, [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5686.400000000001s)]
*  doesn't get the benefit of the calls all the time, but now so that he does this wave thing. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5693.4400000000005s)]
*  Certain things trigger refs. And one of them is the dismissive wave. They just fucking hate it. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5699.6s)]
*  They really don't like it. And he gets whistled on that over and over again, or they hold it [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5704.96s)]
*  against them. And it's weird. Cause I think he's probably the quietest, most unassuming superstar [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5708.8s)]
*  we have. He's a really good guy. Yeah. And this is like his one thing. Like he just gets really [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5714.16s)]
*  pissed about it. I've had the opportunity to spend a lot of time with him at Team USA. Yeah. I spent [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5719.68s)]
*  three weeks covering him in China in 19. I spent, um, we weren't as close in the 2021. I might say [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5724.72s)]
*  we weren't as close. I'm talking about we couldn't get as close in Tokyo, but still he was, by the [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5731.2s)]
*  way, it was awesome with the Tokyo team. I kind of feel like people didn't watch that fine, that [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5736.8s)]
*  Olympics. It was just off and everything. I don't, I don't, I didn't, nobody ever talks about that [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5741.12s)]
*  Olympics. Durant was absolutely freaking great. I honestly can't even remember what happened, [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5745.36s)]
*  but I don't remember anything. I don't remember 2020, 2021. Tatum was arguably their second best [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5750.8s)]
*  player. Well, it felt like Tatum was going to have this arc where he was going to be one of the best [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5756.0s)]
*  American, cause he was just such a perfect Olympic guy. He still can't, he still can't. Like he's got [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5760.4s)]
*  plenty of time. We're going to be here in LA in three years, four years, whatever. Well, they, [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5765.28s)]
*  I mean, he's the number one guy they need for, just because of what he does specifically. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5769.44s)]
*  He is a perfect international player. And, um, he was that in that Olympics, they were in big [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5775.2s)]
*  trouble against Australia in the semifinals. Um, Australia had been building toward that game for [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5782.24s)]
*  a decade. Um, you know, their guys, you know, Patty Mills and Joe Ingalls and, um, who am I forgetting? [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5788.719999999999s)]
*  I mean, the golden generation of, they won the bronze. They ended up getting their first ever [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5798.32s)]
*  medal. This was their sports movie and this was the ending of the sports movie. They're ahead by 12 or 14 in the third quarter, [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5803.36s)]
*  which international basketball is like 25 because the games are shorter. And Popovich goes to a [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5809.2s)]
*  triangle and two, which they had practiced like, for like barely part of one practice. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5816.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5823.599999999999s)]
*  Australia like staggers for like three possessions. They've never seen the Americans do this before. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5824.8s)]
*  Durant hits like three threes, Tatey misses shot. I can't remember who else, but Durant [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5830.24s)]
*  turned it because Durant was untouchable. You know, Durant was coming off the Achilles [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5834.48s)]
*  and played because he loves team USA so much. It was such a wholesome moment. Um, they come back and beat [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5839.92s)]
*  Australia. It's a great comeback. Nobody ever remembers it. If they had lost, people remember [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5846.8s)]
*  forever. And then they play a really competitive game with France in the title game. Um, where Tatum, [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5851.44s)]
*  I think played really well. Like, um, drew holiday was huge, uh, defending in the semi-finals and [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5857.12s)]
*  finals. That's when all the coaches really fell in love with them. Yes. One of the things I like about you is [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5863.04s)]
*  you love international basketball and taking big giant takeaways from them even more than I do. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5868.639999999999s)]
*  Well, they just, I really value it. I think it's such an interesting kind of laboratory to put all [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5875.28s)]
*  of these great players in and see how they're going to respond. Like the fact that Jokic, [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5881.12s)]
*  you know, almost beat team USA by himself and, and it was sitting there for him and, you know, [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5885.599999999999s)]
*  it even had the most amazing game, but the fact was his team thought he was the best guy in the [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5892.88s)]
*  court and he gave them the chance and then they missed some shots. The Serbians are fascinating [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5897.28s)]
*  the way they play. Bogie Bogdanovic is like when you, the same way with Patty Mills, [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5902.64s)]
*  if you watch Patty Mills, he's now he's past his prime, but yeah, Patty Mills, if you squinted, [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5909.84s)]
*  you thought he was Steve Nash, the way he plays for the team Australia in 2019 in China, which [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5916.0s)]
*  was the world cup in China, they ended up finishing out the medals there, but he played a couple of [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5921.68s)]
*  games where you're like, why isn't this guy a hall of fame? Well, remember the Spain team in the [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5926.32s)]
*  2000s or like Juan Carlos Navarro? Why isn't this guy? La Bamba. Why isn't this guy a 13 mile NBA? [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5930.88s)]
*  Spain won in 2019. The Americans had a terrible team. Tatum was on that team. He was leading them [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5936.5599999999995s)]
*  tweener team. He sprained his ankle. Yeah. And I gave him against Turkey that they win in overtime. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5942.4s)]
*  And again, like I'm in Shanghai on a Saturday night. It's the middle of the night in America. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5948.08s)]
*  No one cares. And Ersan Ilyasova is kicking our ass, right? And Tatum is saving the day. They end [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5953.599999999999s)]
*  up going to overtime and Tatum sprains his ankle in overtime and he's, he's cooked the rest of the [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5961.679999999999s)]
*  way. And we ended up in seventh, seventh. But anyway, in that game, Ricky Rubio, so Nia, you gotta [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5966.0s)]
*  remember the Ricky Rubio story. Yeah. Rubio was boy wonder for Spain. Age 17 playing against the [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5975.04s)]
*  U S and O eight. Exactly. Comes to Beijing. They've made documentaries about this game. Rubio is trash. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5983.44s)]
*  He was trash in the game. It was miserable in this arena. Now we are now 11 years later. Rubio has [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5990.08s)]
*  gone through his career. He's had a middling career. He's had his moments. 2019. He is playing [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=5994.88s)]
*  in the same arena. They are playing against Argentina in the final. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6001.68s)]
*  Luis Scola turns the clock back, somehow gets Argentinians to the final. Rubio is amazing. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6006.4800000000005s)]
*  Dancing on air. Marc Gasol has just won the title with Toronto. A few months later, he wins the gold [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6013.28s)]
*  medal. You know, this is this, you know, the Spain, the Spanish get this world championship. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6018.24s)]
*  They're celebrating. Rubio is amazing. Rubio is named, is named an MVP. His mother has just died [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6024.24s)]
*  like a breast cancer a few months before. He comes over. We, we televised the game at ESPN. Again, [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6033.679999999999s)]
*  no one had watched this because why are you watching in the middle of, or, you know, maybe it's, [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6039.599999999999s)]
*  you know, it was, it was a 2 a.m. whatever. And Rubio is having the greatest moment of his career. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6044.4800000000005s)]
*  He's won the MVP for Spain in the arena. And I asked him, I do the postgame interview because [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6051.6s)]
*  I'm doing the sideline interview. He, Rubio does like seven interviews, like, because he's, you [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6057.36s)]
*  know, all the world feeds. He does, you know, France and whatever. And I asked him about his [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6062.64s)]
*  mother and he starts crying. No one ever saw this. It's the greatest. I'll never do, I don't do [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6067.92s)]
*  sideline interviews, but I will never, I could do a hundred of them and never do a better interview. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6072.64s)]
*  Rubio is in tears having this amazing moment and the average NBA fan, you could even be a Rubio fan [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6076.08s)]
*  and you don't know about this moment where he wins. And, you know, subsequently, like basically he [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6082.96s)]
*  quits basketball because of, you know, mental health stuff. So I still feel like if you redo, [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6088.96s)]
*  that's a, that's a classic, let's redo the career and try another, try another outcome, which just [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6095.200000000001s)]
*  hit the reset button on the video game and bring them into the NBA in 2009. He got drafted instead [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6101.76s)]
*  of Steph Curry. And then he didn't come over right away and he tore his ACL. He ended up on the dumbest team ever. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6106.08s)]
*  Kobe fell into his leg. It was just, everything went wrong for four years. I still feel like [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6110.24s)]
*  there was a lot more there. So he has this moment. So that's what I get in international basketball. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6114.88s)]
*  You have these moments. Bogie Bogdanovich is in a feud with his coach. The, the, the, this guy, if you, [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6117.68s)]
*  if you saw, what's the Netflix series, they had him on there. Yeah, quarter gold, yeah. Pesach. He's this [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6124.24s)]
*  old, hard, mean SOB. And he and Bogdanovich got into it during the 2023 World Cup. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6131.12s)]
*  Jokic didn't play. I don't know why Jokic didn't play. I can speculate as to why Jokic didn't play. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6140.96s)]
*  Whatever. Jokic doesn't play. And it's really hard to qualify for the Olympics. It's really hard [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6147.12s)]
*  because you got to go through all this qualifying, you know, and the Serbians, [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6154.24s)]
*  I'm like, well, Jokic doesn't play and Serbia ain't qualifying because you got to be, you got to be [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6158.64s)]
*  the top two European finishers at the World Cup to qualify. I'm like, they ain't qualifying. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6161.68s)]
*  Well, Bogdanovich, after getting benched by this coach, has this incredible run in the knockout [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6167.76s)]
*  rounds, carries Serbia to the championship. And yeah, they lose, but they qualify for the Olympics. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6173.360000000001s)]
*  And I'm going again, like, nobody cares about this, but I'm sitting there going, well, this is a bad [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6179.12s)]
*  break for the United States. Serbia disqualified for the Olympics. Right. And I'm like, [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6184.240000000001s)]
*  now Jokic will see them in Paris. And I was worried. By the way, he really cares. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6188.64s)]
*  I was worried about the, about team USA losing to Serbia in August of 23, when the Serbians qualified. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6193.68s)]
*  And then they set up the schedule so that Serbia got three looks at the U.S. They played them in Dubai [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6201.76s)]
*  for an exhibition game, which again, nobody cares, but they got a look at them. Then they [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6210.320000000001s)]
*  played them in the pool play and they got them in the knockout rounds and Pesic and Jokic and all [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6213.84s)]
*  those dudes played it to set up the United States to go after them. They didn't care what the score [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6219.84s)]
*  was in the pool play game. They set them, they set it up to go at, they were thinking about it for [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6226.8s)]
*  months. The draw that got Serbia into the USA's pool was like in February. They started thinking [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6231.6s)]
*  February about that night in August when they could get them in the semi-finals. They didn't [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6238.4s)]
*  know it would be the semi-final, but they knew they would see them. And they set the whole thing [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6243.759999999999s)]
*  up and they took money, extra money to go to Abu Dhabi and play. I'm telling you, all building up [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6247.2s)]
*  to that moment. And the average fan, USA fan doesn't care. I don't blame them. I'm just telling [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6252.96s)]
*  you all that drama is going into it. And Steve Kerr and Sean Ford, like the general manager of [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6258.16s)]
*  USA basketball, like they're thinking about it for months. Like as Steve Kerr is coaching [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6265.28s)]
*  the Warriors last year, he's like, I know, I got to worry about Serbia. And Jeff Van Gundy is like [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6269.6s)]
*  consulting with the Celtics. Jeff Van Gundy is he's on the USA staff. He's thinking about Serbia, [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6276.16s)]
*  Serbia, Serbia, Serbia. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6282.88s)]
*  Well then you have to have France at home, which is the other one. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6284.08s)]
*  Of course, which the French were actually in the middle of imploding and then they [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6286.64s)]
*  rallied back. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6290.08s)]
*  It's weird because I actually think they really could use Tatum in those games. And I understand [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6291.2s)]
*  why he didn't play. And, you know, I think in a weird way. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6295.6s)]
*  You are in the minority because. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6299.6s)]
*  No, I, I really get it. I just think they won the title and he was worn out and he had a kid and he [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6301.5199999999995s)]
*  missed a couple of practices and his shot was off. And also Steve doesn't give a shit. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6307.92s)]
*  Here's the thing. I keep saying this. People don't listen to me. It's fine. I don't care. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6314.64s)]
*  International basketball is so vastly different. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6321.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6324.72s)]
*  The difference between 40 and 48 minutes. I cannot underline how big of a difference it is. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6325.12s)]
*  It is so different. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6331.84s)]
*  Especially the flow of the game is in person. That's the weirdest thing to get used to. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6333.12s)]
*  And also the five files. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6336.88s)]
*  Things won't stop. Yeah. Right. You get all of a sudden somebody has four files. There's 15 [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6338.08s)]
*  minutes left in the game. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6342.48s)]
*  Right. And so everything is the NBA man mindset is if you get down 15, it doesn't matter. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6343.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. You can always come back. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6352.0s)]
*  You can't play that. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6353.44s)]
*  Well, you also can't chase calls. And in this, in that international version, you can't [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6354.08s)]
*  lurch into somebody and you can't get bailed out left and right. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6359.68s)]
*  It's the inverse of the NBA. So here's the thing in the NBA, like there's this inherent bias that [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6362.72s)]
*  everybody wants the Lakers and the Celtics to do well. And whether or not that's true or not. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6367.44s)]
*  It's definitely the Lakers part. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6371.68s)]
*  Of course. Nothing ever goes in Celtics way. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6373.92s)]
*  You're right. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6375.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. We haven't gotten one break. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6376.0s)]
*  In the international game, they want the U S to lose. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6377.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6382.96s)]
*  Like when the U S loses, the FIBA officials are over there giving each other high fives under the [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6383.599999999999s)]
*  table. They want the U S to lose because they want it to be more of a global game. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6388.16s)]
*  Well, would you change the, I I've said this every four years, I would, [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6393.12s)]
*  I would put a cap on the age of the guys we have. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6397.36s)]
*  So you have to be in your twenties or your teens and that's it. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6401.04s)]
*  So here's my recommendation. And I know that people are probably turning off the pod because [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6405.12s)]
*  we're talking about international basketball. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6408.5599999999995s)]
*  Now this is great stuff. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6410.32s)]
*  So the next world cup is in 2027. I will give you all the money in my wallet if you tell me, [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6411.68s)]
*  because you obviously need it. All the money in my wallet. If you can tell me [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6416.5599999999995s)]
*  where the world cup is being played in 2027, I'd give you seven guesses. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6421.68s)]
*  You're not going to take that and be boring, but you have any idea where the world cup is being [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6425.92s)]
*  played. Isn't it somewhere weird? Like Saudi Arabia. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6429.36s)]
*  You're close. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6432.5599999999995s)]
*  Where is it? [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6433.28s)]
*  Saudi Arabia probably the next one. It's in Doha. It's in Qatar. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6434.08s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6438.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6438.88s)]
*  Are you going? [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6439.28s)]
*  I don't want to. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6440.24s)]
*  It'll be in August. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6442.88s)]
*  You're on a plane for a day and a half, right? [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6443.44s)]
*  I've gone to Abu Dhabi the last two summers with Team USA and absolutely loved it. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6445.5199999999995s)]
*  And I know that it's, [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6450.48s)]
*  You're a big Abu Dhabi guy. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6452.0s)]
*  I love Abu Dhabi. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6453.2s)]
*  And you know, the NBA is getting closer to there. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6456.16s)]
*  Um, and, um, his excellency Muhammad Amu Barak is the head of, um, the chairman. I call him the [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6459.52s)]
*  chairman of the department of culture and tourism. He is possible podcast for you podcast partner. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6467.76s)]
*  I would love to have him on a podcast. He'd be great on a podcast. He knows the [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6476.0s)]
*  way North and his excellence. The new podcast you'd get along with. Well, he hates the Celtics, [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6479.04s)]
*  but he went to school at Northeastern and he told me this. He told me this great story. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6483.76s)]
*  He's his, by the way, his brother is Caldoon Al Mubarak who runs the city football group, [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6489.04s)]
*  Man City runs Man City. That's his brother. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6494.64s)]
*  His brother is a couple of years older than him. He was going to school in Boston. I'm not sure if [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6497.84s)]
*  it's a Northeastern or something else. He comes to visit his brother. He's 16 years old. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6500.8s)]
*  They go to a Celtics game. This is like the ruling, the ruling family of Abu Dhabi. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6504.88s)]
*  They go to a Celtics game. Um, and he's a big Laker fan because why wouldn't he be because, [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6510.16s)]
*  you know, he lives in Abu Dhabi. Why wouldn't he be a Laker fan? [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6514.96s)]
*  So they go to the Laker in 2010 finals. He's going to a finals game, Lakers, [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6517.84s)]
*  Celtics. He's wearing a Laker jersey. He doesn't know, he doesn't know any better. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6525.360000000001s)]
*  Okay. He doesn't understand. Oh, he's in Boston with the Lakers. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6529.6s)]
*  He's going to a finals game in Boston. Okay. And he comes up and he and his brother sit down [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6533.04s)]
*  and right next to him are these, these, this husband and wife in their seventies. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6539.28s)]
*  And they've got like these, you know, the husband's wearing like this old Larry Bird jersey. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6544.08s)]
*  This probably has since 82 and the wife is all dressed up and they're all dressed out and they're [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6547.68s)]
*  all ready. And, um, he goes down and says, Oh, Hey, how are you? He sounds, he thinks it's charming. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6551.76s)]
*  And the woman looks over at him and flips them off. It's like, welcome to Boston. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6556.8s)]
*  So he goes to school in Boston. Anyway, he knows the NBA extremely well. He would love to be heavily [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6562.0s)]
*  invested in the NBA. Um, I've spent quite a bit of time with him. I, I like him a lot. I know that [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6568.32s)]
*  there's challenges when you're doing business in the middle East or whatever. I don't pretend to [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6575.759999999999s)]
*  know. I'm not trying to cast aspersions. The global windy. I see even more impressive than [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6580.799999999999s)]
*  some of my connections. I had like, for, for example, he would make comments. He was talking [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6585.92s)]
*  about a certain Lakers player. I don't want to put his business out there. He was talking about a [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6592.0s)]
*  certain Lakers player who's no longer on the team. And he says the reason his teammates don't like [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6595.28s)]
*  him is because he doesn't play defense. That's why they don't like him. This is the kind of [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6599.599999999999s)]
*  commentary he's giving. He watches it games in the morning when he's like on the treadmill, [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6602.48s)]
*  he's watching Laker games. Like when I first met him, he was traditionally dressed, but then he, [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6607.84s)]
*  you know, sits down, he was wearing Jordy. So he's super into it. Um, last year when the U S went to [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6614.8s)]
*  Abu Dhabi to play, um, he came and addressed the team on the first day of practice and he very [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6622.64s)]
*  begrudgingly congratulated, uh, Tatum drew holiday and, um, who was the third Celtic, uh, Derek White. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6628.96s)]
*  It's like, congratulations on the new ownership group. I'm going to guess, you know, if they [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6636.64s)]
*  allowed him to buy it, he would have bought it, but they don't allow the sovereign wealth funds to [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6641.92s)]
*  were you, did you think it would get to 6 billion? No. Also the team's not sold yet. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6647.76s)]
*  Don't start with that. No, that's ridiculous. No, I did not think they would get to 6 billion. And [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6653.92s)]
*  with Bruce Bach all the way through said, I'm going to get my price. I'm going to get my deal, [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6660.16s)]
*  which is enables him to stay as I'm going to get Adam Sobers price. That's what it was. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6664.240000000001s)]
*  Well, his price, the number was six. They got more than six. Well, when you throw in like that [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6669.360000000001s)]
*  little bully tax you have for the other owners, it's six one plus it actually that that part goes [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6674.64s)]
*  into the sevens from what I understand. And you know, the deal's not official or whatever, [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6680.56s)]
*  but from what I understand, you know, they're buying 51% this year at six and they're buying [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6686.240000000001s)]
*  the other 49% at like seven. Yeah. And so the price is actually a little bit, [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6691.68s)]
*  it's higher than they're being in their side. Yeah. Boston Celtics, not a lot of, [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6696.240000000001s)]
*  not a lot of franchises and pro sports like that, but yeah, it's nuts. They have no, [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6701.28s)]
*  they don't own their own arena. Now they have an incredible power spot in that arena because if [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6704.88s)]
*  they decide to start building their own, the place they're in now is screwed. So I don't, [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6711.599999999999s)]
*  they'll be fine. Well, I would just say this about the Celtics. I think Sportico reported this. I [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6716.32s)]
*  haven't heard this, but Sportico is good at their business. I think they probably got it because [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6722.48s)]
*  the Celtics financials got out there because they had to give, they had to show them to people. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6728.08s)]
*  They had bidders. The Celtics made $450 million last year. That was their revenue. Just great. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6732.8s)]
*  Probably, I don't have the whole league, but definitely top five, maybe top three. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6739.12s)]
*  Well, especially when she go four rounds in the playoffs, that is a whole other level. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6743.36s)]
*  It was probably, it was, I feel comfortable saying was the largest [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6747.5199999999995s)]
*  revenue season in the history of the Celtics franchise. Yeah. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6752.64s)]
*  Their payroll next year is $450 million. If it's the exact same roster. I don't think any. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6755.92s)]
*  Yeah. Fine. I'm just saying though that like, [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6761.52s)]
*  why did the Groosebach family want to sell now? Because they know that their payrolls, [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6765.36s)]
*  they're equal to their revenue. That's- So I don't believe that. I actually, [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6770.64s)]
*  I'm going to push back. I don't think that's why. I think the dad was old and I don't think [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6774.72s)]
*  he's 90 and I think they have four kids. Hey, listen, I don't know. I'm not in their family. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6780.08s)]
*  I don't know. He hadn't been to a game since 2010. I think he's like, let's sell this thing. We won [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6785.12s)]
*  the title. Let's go. And that, that, I really think it was that simple. Do I think Wick want to sell [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6789.44s)]
*  it? No. Well, he's not selling it. He gets to run it for three more years. He gets to run it for up [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6794.64s)]
*  to three more years. Okay. That this new owner at whenever he feels like, okay, I've, I've, [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6800.0s)]
*  I'm feeling good on all my business side. I'm ready to take over. I am not claiming to have [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6807.84s)]
*  inside information, but you, but you think that the fact that they are going to spend is on as [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6811.52s)]
*  much money on payrolls they take in next year. In other words, they're facing hundreds of millions [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6817.6s)]
*  of dollars in losses. You think that had nothing to do with it? I don't. Okay. I don't. I really, [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6823.68s)]
*  I think this was a, I really think this was a family thing. And I think there was a lot going [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6829.12s)]
*  on that had nothing to do with the fortunes that that guy, Irv, the 90 year old, the legend, [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6833.36s)]
*  yeah, he's made a kajillion dollars. Like he's, you think he cares that they don't know his [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6839.44s)]
*  finances. I know he's met, you've got a lot more now. The thing is, I don't think this would be the [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6843.599999999999s)]
*  same roster, which is why the Celtics, this little run is so interesting. Not only trying to go back [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6848.88s)]
*  to back, but odds are this won't be the same nucleus. And whether if you win again, [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6853.28s)]
*  does that mean you keep the roster together or you, you can start? It's the age old thing, [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6859.6s)]
*  right? Like Dallas didn't do it. Right. In 11, we've seen teams say like, yeah, we took that. Like [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6864.08s)]
*  we've seen teams like the Pistons in the late eighties where they left more unprotected. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6871.360000000001s)]
*  I personally do not think the expensive guys will all be together next year, but I don't know. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6876.8s)]
*  I don't either. It just seems like it would make more sense for them if you're paying, [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6882.240000000001s)]
*  let's say holiday or poor Zynga, you're paying those guys 34 million, but with all the other [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6886.16s)]
*  things that come into play, those guys now are worth a hundred million dollars and you could [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6890.639999999999s)]
*  reset that way and you lose one guy and you're weaker in one spot, but you've still have Tatum [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6896.24s)]
*  and Brown. Right. Well, I would hold onto Tatum and Brown as long as possible. Yeah. Cause everybody [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6900.5599999999995s)]
*  always thinks Jaylen's the one that they would trade. But as you know, and this is why with the [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6906.16s)]
*  Durant stuff, I just, I'm doing a lot of yeah, butting with the Durant stuff. Like, well, they're [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6910.8s)]
*  going to trade Durant. It's like, okay, cool. He makes $55 million a year and everybody is handcuffed [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6915.44s)]
*  by this tax in some way. It's not that it's not easy like it was. It's not easy to just get somebody [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6922.08s)]
*  that's making 55 to 60. I agree. A Durant trade is going to be complicated because if I don't know [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6928.4s)]
*  what Kevin wants and I would never, I've learned my lesson not to guess what Kevin wants. If he [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6934.879999999999s)]
*  wants to go to a contender, that contender is going to have a high payroll. Probably, [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6940.96s)]
*  you know, that those trades are hard. The sons are in the second apron. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6945.52s)]
*  Well, also if you're trading him to a team that's over an apron, then once we start getting into the, [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6949.2s)]
*  I can only take one guy back and it's, it's really stupid. So I would just like, I wrote a story [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6955.44s)]
*  about the sons published this week. I mentioned in there with the help of Bobby Marks, Devin Booker [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6962.24s)]
*  is eligible for a two-year extension this year for 150 million. I'm going to say that again. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6968.56s)]
*  He's eligible for an extension for two years and 150. That's 75 million a year. Wow. Nobody's even [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6977.92s)]
*  at 65 yet, right? Because it's three years from now. Oh my God. Okay. So we're projecting the cap [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6985.280000000001s)]
*  out there, but the cap is going to be- By the way, not on my own MBA team, Devin Booker. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6992.4800000000005s)]
*  We didn't have a good year, but forget about that. My point is, is that the max contracts [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=6995.84s)]
*  are headed towards 75 million a year, not in 2035. I'm talking about if Devin gets the max this [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7001.68s)]
*  summer, which quite frankly, I don't know how they're going to get away with not paying him. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7008.88s)]
*  Because if you don't pay him, then what sort of message are you sending? [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7012.8s)]
*  Well, you could call Daryl Morey and ask how that worked out. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7016.64s)]
*  Well, that's true. Devin's 28 though. He's not 34. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7019.2s)]
*  I don't know where this goes because I think I've talked to a bunch of people about it [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7023.68s)]
*  on both sides and just the owners in general, they're always going to be smarter and they're [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7029.92s)]
*  always going to get whatever they want to get done, actually get done. And they're trying to [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7035.360000000001s)]
*  put in all these protections basically against themselves. They're basically childproofing [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7039.280000000001s)]
*  all of the electrical outlets around their house because they don't want to have their kids stick [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7044.16s)]
*  their finger in. They have like eight owners who will just say, oh, what's this? And they get [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7051.44s)]
*  electrocuted. And that's all they care about. And I don't think the players, I just don't think they [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7056.0s)]
*  saw it their side. I don't think saw it correctly. And they didn't see how hard this was going to be [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7063.04s)]
*  with keeping teams together, keeping players in cities. And eventually I think there's going to [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7067.759999999999s)]
*  be a backlash with the salaries. We're going to move toward a little bit more like the Hollywood [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7072.96s)]
*  system where you have your two guys on the poster and then everybody else is way down there. And I [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7077.68s)]
*  don't think the union realizes that. I think the Clippers are ahead of the, the Clippers were [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7082.240000000001s)]
*  targeted. Perfect. The Clippers figured this out first. Number one, when they negotiate with Kawhi, [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7086.64s)]
*  he didn't get the max. He got close to the max. This was, in my view, this is going to be the new [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7092.0s)]
*  normal. The idea that these guys mid-career, oh, it's time for a contract extension. You want the [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7096.0s)]
*  max? Here you go. They're going to get extended, but they're not going to get, they're not just [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7100.8s)]
*  going to be assumption. You're not going to, how many max, how many guys right now are making the [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7105.36s)]
*  max contract? Now I'm not talking about their max because this is a thing the agents play and [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7109.28s)]
*  we help them with it in the media. I'm not looking to, but like a player's max is the most he can get [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7114.24s)]
*  versus the actual max. How many guys right now in the league are making the quote unquote max? [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7119.759999999999s)]
*  There's dozens. Three years from now, I think there's going to be a third of that. So you think [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7124.0s)]
*  it's going to be like more of a Jalen Brunson type of situation? I think in a situation with Jalen [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7128.96s)]
*  Brunson, you're going to, there's teams are going to, I think he's still signed for less than he [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7133.44s)]
*  could have got. The teams are going to, they're going to, they're going to give them, they're [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7138.08s)]
*  going to get hundreds of millions, but they're not going to all of us just get the max. Like [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7141.599999999999s)]
*  you're not going to get, okay, mid-career all-star player. You're not getting 35%. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7145.5199999999995s)]
*  So you don't think we'll see Bradley Beale getting a no trade clause and 50 million again? [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7150.4s)]
*  That would be a good thing is to put in a little canister for the future. When is the next no trade [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7154.719999999999s)]
*  clause? Well, I know the Bron will get it when he opts out and re-ups this year with the Lakers, [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7159.84s)]
*  but when is the next new no trade clause coming? You think LeBron will get a no trade? Yeah, [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7164.72s)]
*  I think he will. Again? Yeah. Why would he, why would he, why would he, he would just opt in if [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7169.92s)]
*  he, he has to get it. This LeBron thing is, I, I just don't understand. Like I, I voted from second [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7174.96s)]
*  team on NBA. So did I. So did I. He entered the league. I had been, I had been working for ESPN [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7181.92s)]
*  I think for a year. I had, I did have a dog at that point. I think I was married, no kids. Like [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7188.64s)]
*  this is, I, I, I just don't get it. Bill, I had a flip phone. He had a flip phone. Like it was [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7198.320000000001s)]
*  laughable. The iPhone was, when he came in the league, we were four years away from Twitter. We [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7204.160000000001s)]
*  were three, four years away from the iPhone. Like, I just. Like the Hummer was a car that mattered. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7209.12s)]
*  Yes. When he came into the league, I remember my first trade deadline covering the Cavs. This is [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7217.6s)]
*  how trade deadline day went. I went to practice to shoot around or it was practice. I did my post [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7224.08s)]
*  practice interview. I went to lunch. I was at lunch, eating sandwich. My cell phone rings. Hello, [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7230.320000000001s)]
*  Jim Paxson, the General Manager of Cavs. Hey, hey, I just want to let you know we traded for [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7238.320000000001s)]
*  Flip Murray. Oh really? What'd you trade for him? 2004 second round pick. Okay. Why'd you trade [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7243.04s)]
*  for him? Why is it going to help us with scoring off the bench? Okay. All right. I'll see you tomorrow. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7248.72s)]
*  Keep eating my lunch. You know, two hours later went home. Then I wrote my story that published [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7252.56s)]
*  in the newspaper in the morning. None of this minute by minute trying to find out like who was [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7257.76s)]
*  getting traded. Like, Oh my God, the General Manager called and was like, Hey, we made a trade. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7263.92s)]
*  Oh really? You know, like that's how you found out about trades. When the Cavs traded for Shaquille [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7269.68s)]
*  O'Neal and that was not in 2000. That was not 1997. That was like actually like that was in [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7275.280000000001s)]
*  the Twitter era. That was like 2009, 2010, 2009. Danny Ferry just called me up. He's like, yeah, [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7280.96s)]
*  we traded for Shaquille O'Neal. Oh, okay. What'd you give? Like Ben Wallace in the first round. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7288.4800000000005s)]
*  That's how it happened. You weren't like waiting, you know, on top of it, you know, [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7294.32s)]
*  it was basically the ticker on ESPN. Yes. It was breaking a lot of stuff. Even the website wasn't [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7301.04s)]
*  really, um, I was writing for it at that point. It wasn't really set up to be like, Oh, this happened. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7306.5599999999995s)]
*  Boom. Let's go. And in 2009 Twitter was around, but people weren't paying attention as a newsfeed. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7312.639999999999s)]
*  No. So like, you know, like that was like, there was two years, everybody just went on Twitter to [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7317.92s)]
*  like make jokes. Yes. That was LeBron. That was LeBron. That was, I was happening in LeBron's [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7323.76s)]
*  career. Like that's how it was, was, and now look at, you know, it's pretty nuts. I even think like [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7328.88s)]
*  how different things were just from you go to the year that the year that Twitter took off on nine [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7335.04s)]
*  and there were all these stages with Twitter, right? Like the decision was the stage. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7342.24s)]
*  Um, the, the Blake Griffin being the first kind of guy who, when he dunked, [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7346.8s)]
*  maybe you could see some grainy video of it on Twitter. Yes. And he became the first like [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7353.04s)]
*  social media dunk guy. Then the Deandre Jordan thing was another great one where that was in real [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7357.68s)]
*  time. We're following through Twitter, how that's going. So it's had these my first big Twitter thing [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7363.12s)]
*  was, um, the LeBron free agent meetings, because nowadays the free agent meetings, like [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7369.28s)]
*  first off, like by July 1st, we're all done. Nobody goes on free agent meeting tours anymore. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7377.04s)]
*  Secondly, they do it all in secret, you know, it's people's houses and stuff. Or three, [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7381.2s)]
*  four months before free agency starts. Or a year. Yeah. Or, Oh, I didn't realize you were [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7387.599999999999s)]
*  going to be at this dinner. Yeah. Yeah. Um, the owner of the team that has calf space. Right. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7392.08s)]
*  Have you met him? This is Bob. Listen, I saw Joel Embiid and Paul George on the countdown [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7398.32s)]
*  set during the finals last year. Right. That was an amazing moment. It was an amazing moment. And, [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7404.24s)]
*  you know, Joel gave him the side eye. I mean, like, it's a little bit manufactured. Obviously [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7409.679999999999s)]
*  Joel and Paul George had communicated before that meeting. Like they said, all these dudes know each [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7414.24s)]
*  other. Of course. Well, anyway, the day of the free agent meetings, like was three days, you know, [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7418.96s)]
*  they were having them at this office building in Cleveland and the teams were just walking into [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7424.32s)]
*  the lobby and I was just sitting in the lobby. I was just tweeting it. Um, Jim Dolan just came in. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7430.4s)]
*  Pat Riley is waiting outside the elevator. Uh, I remember the Clippers got there. The heat ran [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7437.36s)]
*  really late and there was no place for the Clippers to wait. And Neil O'Shea and Andy [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7442.0s)]
*  Rosa are just standing there in the hallway and just walking back and forth waiting for Pat Riley [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7446.32s)]
*  and Eric Spolster and Mickey Harrison to finish. And I was just live tweeting it. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7453.599999999999s)]
*  I was just live tweeting it. Like I was like, well, the, uh, Michael Procroft just left, [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7457.599999999999s)]
*  but Jay Z is staying back. He must be having a special meeting with LeBron. I was just tweeting [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7461.599999999999s)]
*  what I saw. And like nowadays you'd never get that, but like, I think I had 14,000 Twitter [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7466.48s)]
*  followers at the beginning of that. And three days later I had like 32,000, which blew my mind. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7472.48s)]
*  Wow. But that was like an actual event where like, I was just like, just, [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7479.04s)]
*  nobody was saying, it wasn't like Mickey Harrison was saying, yep, we got it done. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7483.5199999999995s)]
*  I was just tweeting when I was sitting there watching. I was just standing in the elevator [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7487.759999999999s)]
*  lobby. I was sitting in the elevator lobby watching. And then every time you think we're [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7490.5599999999995s)]
*  post Twitter, then something like the look at thing happens. Yeah. And then it's, there you go. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7494.32s)]
*  When did you find out? Did you find out? I had no idea it was coming. I did not know. Most of the [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7501.92s)]
*  time, you know, when stuff's coming like we do, like, you know, you can't always, sometimes you [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7507.6s)]
*  know, something's going to happen and you're just waiting, you know, in our case, it's almost always [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7512.96s)]
*  Shams. Shams knows it. He's got the story written. He's got the tweet and the drafts and he's waiting. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7517.76s)]
*  That happened this week with, with Mike Buddenholzer. I'm sure there was a David Griffin [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7523.52s)]
*  typed out tweet there too. I don't know that for sure. No, I'm just saying. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7530.240000000001s)]
*  Without pulling the curtain back too much, Shams had the Mike Buddenholzer story written before he [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7534.24s)]
*  was actually fired. Yeah. Because Shams is on top of it. I mean, he could have written in February. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7539.2s)]
*  Well, that's a different, that was a different thing. But the look at thing came out of absolutely [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7543.2s)]
*  nowhere. So what is your honest take for how many people knew before the trade came out? [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7548.56s)]
*  I know you and I are on different sides of this. I think it was a small number. It's bigger than [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7555.92s)]
*  the purported number, like whatever they said, but you know, I think it was a small number. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7560.72s)]
*  I think it was bigger. I know you do. And I think about an hour and a half before [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7566.16s)]
*  when Utah found out who was in the trade, then it's out. And I think it's out at that point. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7572.240000000001s)]
*  And I'm actually, and my theory was that even if they were telling other people, they thought [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7579.52s)]
*  Luca was about to get traded, who would have ever believed that in a million years? And it was like, [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7584.240000000001s)]
*  you might as well have said a UFO just landed on my roof. Right. There's no way to even [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7588.4s)]
*  conceivably think that was possible. So the only thing is, the only thing I'll say is, [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7594.48s)]
*  I wondered if Anthony Davis was wearing thin in LA because he had done that interview where he's [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7600.639999999999s)]
*  like, get me a center. I don't want him to be 100% once. Okay. So when I saw that, like a lot of [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7607.44s)]
*  people, I actually listened, there were two Lakers podcasts that I listened to after. Oh, look at you. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7611.599999999999s)]
*  Where the people, cause the Lakers had had a game that night, I think in New York. Yeah. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7617.84s)]
*  LeBron was awesome in the game, which I thought looking back is also really interesting. He was [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7622.4800000000005s)]
*  very energized in the two games leading up to, I don't want to like give this away because it's not [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7627.04s)]
*  my story to tell. So I'll just tell half of it. One of my ESPN, so the Lakers were in New York. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7632.08s)]
*  Yeah. And one of my ESPN colleagues ran into JJ Reddick in New York that day. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7639.360000000001s)]
*  And they knew JJ and obviously, Hey JJ, what's up? He's like, Hey, I, I gotta go, I gotta go on a [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7647.04s)]
*  walk. I gotta, I gotta clear, I gotta clear my head about something. Like he like excused himself [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7653.5199999999995s)]
*  and kept going. And so JJ knew and like went out for like a walk. That's one of the, but you know, [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7658.16s)]
*  the person obviously didn't know, you know, but JJ, if people think JJ and Jason Kidd didn't know [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7664.72s)]
*  a couple of days before that trade, there's, I just, there's no way. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7671.52s)]
*  I don't believe it. Whether it was days or hours. Yes. The coaches knew before [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7675.76s)]
*  Shams tweeted it. Yes, of course. Yeah. And like you read the people honestly think like LeBron and [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7679.04s)]
*  Rich didn't know that that trade was coming. And that Davis was just like, yeah, I've just weighed [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7684.56s)]
*  by no trade. I just found out about this trade a minute ago. Get the fuck out of here. You've been [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7688.72s)]
*  talking about the trade kicker. Yes. That is suspicious. Suspicious. Like I don't, I don't, [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7692.320000000001s)]
*  he loved being in LA. He loved being the Lakers and the whole thing. And he's just, [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7699.04s)]
*  all right, fine. Cool. I'm going to, you know, not only am I okay with the trade, [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7702.64s)]
*  but I give up money. What's your standard for knowing in advance? Cause like according to [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7707.28s)]
*  Polenka, they negotiated for a month. I think, I think they knew, I would say, I don't know for sure, [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7710.8s)]
*  but I'm excited for when it all finally comes out. And I'm sure there's going to be a now, [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7717.36s)]
*  as Brian Curtis would say, a now they tell us. Yeah. I can't wait for the now they tell us. Cause [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7721.12s)]
*  I think the circle is wider. I think they knew, I think Rich and LeBron knew, but it wasn't too [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7725.52s)]
*  far open for like, I believe them. Well, Rich definitely knew because he had to, you know, [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7732.0s)]
*  the trade couldn't have happened if AD didn't waive the trade kicker. It would have been way [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7738.080000000001s)]
*  more complicated. The trade could have happened, but I agree. That's a flaw in my thinking. I agree. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7742.56s)]
*  And I asked Rich about that. That's the red herring of this whole thing. I asked, do you think they [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7748.320000000001s)]
*  really would have traded LeBron's guy, Anthony Davis to another team and just not tell LeBron? [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7752.96s)]
*  What you are saying, we really think they're not doing that. What you are saying makes sense, but [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7760.56s)]
*  they were focused on keeping this quiet. Yeah. I think they did keep it quiet, but at some point, [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7766.08s)]
*  is your standard that they knew one hour early or that they knew three days early? Because I think [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7772.08s)]
*  they knew maybe one hour early. Is that advanced notice? If I had to bet on a scenario, [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7776.96s)]
*  I would bet that probably two, three, four days earlier. I don't believe that. I know. No, [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7784.32s)]
*  I could be wrong. The trade wasn't done. Okay. But I think it probably got to the point where they [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7788.96s)]
*  were like, I got to bring you in on this. I think we actually have a chance to do this. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7793.44s)]
*  And that's when you expand it to the coaches. I just, I know how the league works and so do [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7799.76s)]
*  you. You don't just hide ship from your best players. Nobody does that. And that's why the [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7804.56s)]
*  rant thing was so crazy that they were shopping him around and not talking to him and Rich Climbing [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7810.4800000000005s)]
*  about it. But that is what they were trying to do it. The reason that got out, I'll tell you, I mean, [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7815.52s)]
*  like- Who's the other teams? Well, that's the thing that the Suns can't execute. They're so [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7820.56s)]
*  hamstrung with their thing. They can't execute. There was a, there was a, I won't go into, there [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7824.72s)]
*  was a third team involved and the third team was negotiating with the Warriors on it. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7829.84s)]
*  Well, this has been reported, right? Was it in Miami? Yeah. So Miami is negotiating with the [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7835.84s)]
*  Warriors on Jimmy Butler. They're trading, they're trading proposals. And then all of a sudden the [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7839.76s)]
*  Warriors change a proposal and the Heat noticed that one of the assets being offered was owned by [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7846.56s)]
*  the Suns. Now I'm not saying that Miami leaked it because Miami doesn't leak anything, but the talks [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7852.4800000000005s)]
*  with other teams, that's how it got out. But that's why it's so hard to do three, four teams. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7859.44s)]
*  Of course. Every team has the six people in the front office and one person who knows how much [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7864.96s)]
*  you can trust that one person out of the six. Of course. Which is one of the reasons why the Heat [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7870.5599999999995s)]
*  are so good because the Heat speak with one voice. Like it's Andy Ellsberg. You deal with the Heat, [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7875.04s)]
*  you deal with the Andy Ellsberg. Obviously at some point, especially this type of trade, maybe Mickey [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7879.919999999999s)]
*  Harrison or Pat Riley. But when you negotiate with the Heat, you negotiate with one person. You [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7884.4s)]
*  negotiate with other teams sometimes it's three or four. But they were trying to keep it quiet [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7888.48s)]
*  because when you don't keep it quiet is when things fall apart. And that's what happened there. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7893.44s)]
*  Yeah. I think they kept it quiet. I really do. And maybe when now they tell us I look like a fool, [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7897.04s)]
*  but in this case- I don't think you look like a fool because I think they've all stuck to their [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7904.24s)]
*  story. But I just, I think Kid New and I think Reddick New and I think they knew for a while. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7907.44s)]
*  Well, I love listening to these two, there were two, maybe there's even more. The Lakers had a [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7910.4s)]
*  game that night in New York. They won Laker fan pods are or analysis pods, whatever you want to [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7914.96s)]
*  call them are recording after the game. They're looking over the Knicks and I loved it. I listened [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7920.0s)]
*  to them learn it live. Oh, interesting. I mean, I was listening live. I was listening back to it. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7926.96s)]
*  Somebody sent it to me and said, listen to these guys because it's hilarious when you know, you [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7932.64s)]
*  have the knowledge and you're listening to them and you can watch them. Like they're like, well, [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7937.76s)]
*  Shams got hacked. You know, right. And they're like, that kind of, that kind of crazy. Wouldn't [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7944.16s)]
*  it like, all right. And that third quarter tonight, they did a real good job in the pick and roll. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7949.28s)]
*  ESPN just tweeted it. Like it's, it's almost like a movie and they're like, oh my God, like it's, [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7953.28s)]
*  you know, and I love that. It was like one of my favorite, like I use, I love it when, when you see, [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7957.92s)]
*  I remember when this became a thing on SportsCenter when they, when like last decade, [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7965.5199999999995s)]
*  when people would videotape themselves watching the end of sporting events. Like I remember the, [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7970.4s)]
*  That's starting to like the world cup was a big one. One of the world cups. The one I remember was, [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7976.4s)]
*  you remember the, the Alabama Auburn game where they returned the field goal. The short field [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7980.4s)]
*  goal was too short and he returned it 108 yards. One of the great things I ever saw on SportsCenter [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7985.679999999999s)]
*  was the Auburn and Alabama fans, the Alabama fans thinking they're about to win it and they're [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7990.5599999999995s)]
*  horrified and the Auburn fans thinking they're about to lose it. And there was like all this [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7995.599999999999s)]
*  stuff. And then like seeing like the Cavs fans in 2016 watching the end of, a lot of people [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=7999.28s)]
*  videotaped themselves watching the end of game seven. Amazing. I just, I have great memories of [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8005.5199999999995s)]
*  that. This was what that was like. You could watch it. So anyway, the shock of it was one of the [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8010.32s)]
*  reasons why it was such an amazing story. Um, well, and it was a shock that everybody could [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8015.2s)]
*  feel whether you covered the league, talked about the league, wrote about the league, liked the league, [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8020.48s)]
*  were dating or married to somebody who was involved in basketball. Everyone had the same sort of, [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8025.4400000000005s)]
*  you remember where you were when it happened. It's such a rare thing for sports. Like [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8030.96s)]
*  even the decision, I don't remember where I was when that happened because you knew it was coming. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8035.12s)]
*  You know, I remember watching it. I don't remember where I watched it. This, I was [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8039.68s)]
*  watching a movie with my wife and I remember where we were. I believed it in the real time, [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8043.76s)]
*  because I didn't know it was coming. Yeah. Was that I thought I was in the back of my head. I [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8048.88s)]
*  was like, I wonder if AD is, is greasing the skids on, you know, on his time in LA. Like I, [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8052.96s)]
*  like it was not something I thought was going to happen at this point. I don't think that thing [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8057.84s)]
*  went over well when he was complaining about stuff. I know it's tough to complain when you're either [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8061.12s)]
*  guy, when they gave up like 10 assets to put the two together. That's where, that's where I start [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8067.52s)]
*  having issues. Like I think the issue might've been that he was talking to Shams about it and not [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8073.52s)]
*  talking to Planka and Jimmy about it. I think that's where the issue may have been. Like what [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8078.08s)]
*  he was asking for was not unreasonable. Yeah. The venue which he asked for it, I think. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8083.84s)]
*  But I don't think that they were like, let's get rid of AD. I think that. No, look, this is a once [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8088.88s)]
*  in a lifetime situation. And as Brissolo and I talked about on Sunday, to do that without Reeves [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8094.32s)]
*  is the craziest part of the whole thing. Well, to me, like, I just don't understand how Reeves isn't [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8099.92s)]
*  in the deal. I'll never understand that for the rest of my life. This is what Bob, so like, you [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8104.48s)]
*  know, when you were doing countdown, you would talk with Magic and you would, I was never there, [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8108.08s)]
*  but you would describe these amazing conversations with Magic during the games. Yeah. Yeah. You know, [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8114.32s)]
*  I've gotten to do countdown about a dozen times this year. I've gotten to do about half those with [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8119.04s)]
*  Bob Myers. It's, I- Because you're hanging out for six hours. Yes. And you know, I covered all these [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8122.24s)]
*  Warriors Cavs series and just the way Bob and I, the way Bob talks about the league, like, [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8130.56s)]
*  I'll bet he gets a job offer every day. Like, the way he views the league, like, and the part of it [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8137.200000000001s)]
*  is because he's so successful and comfortable and he doesn't have to worry about, like, you know, [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8142.4800000000005s)]
*  part of it is the space he's in. Listening to Bob talk about the league privately, you can see why [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8148.56s)]
*  every owner would want to hire him. Right. Because the way, and what he does on TV, [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8157.6s)]
*  I think is great. I don't think actually he gets, of course, I'm biased. He's my teammate. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8162.160000000001s)]
*  The way he, the way he talks about the league, like the way he talked last week about, I can't [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8166.400000000001s)]
*  remember, it was some front office challenge, like, oh, it was a Michael Malone firing. Like, [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8173.04s)]
*  he talked about that whole thing. Like, what he was saying was like literally worth hundreds of [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8178.400000000001s)]
*  thousands of dollars in consulting money. Like if he had consulted with the team. But anyway, [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8185.52s)]
*  he feels the same way I do. I feel good that I'm on the same side as him, which is he can get to a [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8190.240000000001s)]
*  spot where he sees why they traded Luca. He doesn't agree with it, and nor do I, but he can see why, [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8195.6s)]
*  he can see how the Mavericks got to it. They didn't want to pay him the 300 million, whatever. They [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8203.12s)]
*  have more information about Luca than anybody. He can even get himself to the spot where they said, [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8206.960000000001s)]
*  we want Anthony Davis. That's going to be our guy. And so can I, I can get to a spot. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8211.92s)]
*  Again, I wouldn't do it, but I can even, I can see how I can, if I put myself- [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8216.960000000001s)]
*  Him as the centerpiece of a Luca trade. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8221.36s)]
*  I can see how Anthony Davis is a guy they wanted. Like this is what we're going to do. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8223.04s)]
*  And even those two steps are big steps. A lot of people, and I think about every Dallas fan, [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8227.68s)]
*  couldn't make the two steps that I just made, but I've been around the league. I can see it. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8232.16s)]
*  I can't square. The return is what I can't. I can't square. That's where I, that's where I stop. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8236.08s)]
*  I stop right there because here's the thing. Reeves makes, Reeves has one of the best value [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8243.68s)]
*  contracts in the league. And he's gotten better every year. I just voted for him for most [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8248.88s)]
*  improved. I had a real problem for most improved. Oh, it came so close. I had to look the most [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8252.72s)]
*  improved- What did you do for your three? Reeves. Reeves won? Reeves won. Oh man. Zuba, [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8257.12s)]
*  I think I had Zubach. No, I had Denny Avia. I looked at him, but his numbers were basically [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8265.76s)]
*  the same. House left him last year in Washington. He was a great trade. One of the reasons why Joe [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8272.4s)]
*  Cronin got extended in Portland was because of that was how good of a trade that was. I did, [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8276.800000000001s)]
*  I did Daniels. I mean, I thought Daniels was a no brainer. Totally. I'm a big, [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8280.72s)]
*  he plays internationally. I did Brown on Denver. And I totally acceptable. And I did Kamara, [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8284.880000000001s)]
*  who I couldn't believe wasn't in the discussion for any of this stuff. Like who the fuck knew [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8292.56s)]
*  who that guy was a year ago? I put Kamara on my all defensive team. Yeah. All of those are good. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8296.72s)]
*  I'm not going to try to, it's a, it's a bleep show. No, I looked at the Reeves thing. I, he was, [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8301.68s)]
*  I had four guys I liked. And the only thing with Reeves was I liked them last year. I didn't, [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8306.96s)]
*  like, how much did he improve? He was really good last year. Look again, [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8310.64s)]
*  Team USA, I fell in love with him in the summer of 23. I wasn't, he was already a no, it's like- [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8314.8s)]
*  Why didn't you tell San Antonio? He could have saved all of us. A lot of issues here. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8320.96s)]
*  So I was, because Steve Kerr is such a wonderful guy. Yeah. Steve Kerr let the media for that [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8325.679999999998s)]
*  summer in 23. We were sort of embedded with the team. Me and Joe Vardin of the athletic, [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8332.4s)]
*  we were the only people really traveling with them. We went on the team bus when they went to [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8337.359999999999s)]
*  the grand mosque. We flew on the team plane. Tim Reynolds from the AP was also there. Those three [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8342.88s)]
*  of us. And I was riding the bus with the players, I think to the airport or somewhere. And the [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8350.4s)]
*  players were questioning Austin about the contract. He'd already signed it, right? Yeah. Yeah. Because [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8357.359999999999s)]
*  you know, he's like, he's like, he's like, well, you know, I mean, this is off the record. I [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8364.32s)]
*  shouldn't say what he said, but they were- No, I know this story because he was an undrafted [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8369.279999999999s)]
*  free agent. Yeah. Well, he wanted to make sure- And nobody really came after him. And- The Spurs [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8372.56s)]
*  really seriously looked at it. The Lakers were given a gift when the Spurs didn't offer him an [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8376.72s)]
*  offer sheet. They were given a gift and they were able to get him on a deal. Now what Austin got [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8380.72s)]
*  was he got a player option after a year three, because the Lakers were not incentivized to [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8386.56s)]
*  give that to him. There was no offer. Well, and they knew that there was no, the Spurs, what I [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8391.76s)]
*  heard, the Spurs just kind of farted around with it for a few days. And he started to panic that he [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8396.24s)]
*  wasn't going to get any offer. And I think the Lakers strong-armed him. And- I mean, Polinka being [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8401.119999999999s)]
*  a former agent, I think in situations like that really helps him. I will say that he got the player [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8405.04s)]
*  option. So after next year, he can opt out. And if he didn't get that and he was under this contract [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8411.36s)]
*  for two more years, so like it was a victory for him and his agent that, you know, because when [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8417.76s)]
*  you're a restricted free agent, you're screwed. You usually don't get the PO. So he got the player [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8422.640000000001s)]
*  option without a good, if he got an offer sheet, but he didn't get an offer sheet. Now he's in the [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8426.320000000002s)]
*  best situation. And he guaranteed himself tens of millions of dollars. And so his set for life, [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8429.6s)]
*  his family is taken care of and he's got a player option after year three. He did okay, but the [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8436.24s)]
*  players on the team were like talking to him about it. Like, yeah, man, because he was great for [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8440.880000000001s)]
*  team USA. I realized nobody watched it. I understand that. And defensively he was taken advantage of [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8445.6s)]
*  late in the rounds. The teams targeted him. But at least he gives a shit. There's guys who get [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8451.04s)]
*  taken advantage of, but at least they fight and he'll at least fight, you know, we're going to see [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8455.52s)]
*  it in the playoffs. Everybody's going to target him for free rounds. There's no way you were part [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8460.16s)]
*  of team USA. I actually almost didn't vote for him for most improved because in my mind he had [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8464.560000000001s)]
*  already improved. That's why I didn't vote for Cade. Well, because I was like, Cade was the number [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8469.76s)]
*  one pick. He's supposed to be this good. You can't give a guy on a max contract, most improved, [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8473.84s)]
*  no offense to Cade. Cade was on my all-in-the-18. But so yes, so the, if Austin Reeves was making [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8479.2s)]
*  $37 million, okay, the Mavericks could look at you and say, well, look, we can't have Kyrie [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8491.12s)]
*  and AD and Austin Reeves all making, you know, $40 million because we can't do that. If that was the [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8497.36s)]
*  case, I would get it. Like, okay, you can't do the trade. He's making like $14 million and next year [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8504.96s)]
*  he's making like $15 million. Like it's the one of the top five value contracts, well, top 10 value [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8511.279999999999s)]
*  contracts in the league. That's why it's an excuse. And he's one of the best 45 guys in the league [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8516.56s)]
*  right now. That's 45, 50, wherever you want to put him. So at least if it's a two for one, you can talk yourself into it. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8521.279999999999s)]
*  Yes. So that's my, like in my mind, they should have gotten Reeves and the other first round pick [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8526.8s)]
*  and the pick swap. They should have gotten all of it. And I know what's been said. What's been said [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8532.88s)]
*  is that when Jeannie Buss heard about this, she said, we're not trading. And I'm sure Rob Plinka [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8537.359999999999s)]
*  didn't want to trade me either. I'm not saying Rob wanted it. Eventually, we're going to lose [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8542.64s)]
*  Luca unless we don't do this. They're trading. The excuse that comes out is that no, Jeannie Buss said [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8547.439999999999s)]
*  Austin Reeves is not being traded. And I'm like, okay, then hang up the phone. We're [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8554.88s)]
*  trading you, Luca Donchus. You give us what we want. Like, fine, I'll shop them. Right. Like, [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8560.32s)]
*  so I, let me see what I can get for him then. So I just, I disagree with the trade because as critical [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8565.44s)]
*  as I've been of Luca, I recognize he's a top 10 player, top five player, top three, whatever you [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8572.08s)]
*  want to say. Like you dream of having a player like that. He's an imperfect player, but I can close my [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8576.56s)]
*  eyes and I can see him holding the Larry O'Brien trophy in one hand and holding the Bill Russell [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8582.4s)]
*  trophy in the other. I see it. I can see it multiple times. I would not trade a player like [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8586.64s)]
*  that. Sounds like a nightmare. At least not age 25. Wearing a liquor uniform. That's terrible. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8591.359999999999s)]
*  You should feel that way. And so I'm saying- We were almost done with this Lakers team. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8596.96s)]
*  I mean, they were, this was it. They were last legs. One of the great lines, I went, you remember [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8602.72s)]
*  when, when they had the press conference and Plinka was wearing that leather jacket. Yeah. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8608.72s)]
*  At the press conference. Yeah. I was texting with a high ranking executive from their team [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8613.52s)]
*  and he was watching at the same time. I go, Hey, what do you think of this Plinka jacket? [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8619.2s)]
*  You know, cause it was not, it was not normal press conference wear. No, he looked like a John [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8623.2s)]
*  Wick villain or something. And he goes, after that trade, he wears Speedo. And it was just like, [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8627.12s)]
*  right. It was like, yeah, like, unbelievable. Well, I think it was the, honestly, the greatest [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8635.6s)]
*  thing that ever could happen to Luke and Dodge. It's like we talk about, well, cause not only do [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8641.6s)]
*  you go to a bigger market, you're going to be a bigger star and a team that has, you know, big [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8646.800000000001s)]
*  resources, you get to play on a team that has a chance to win the title right now, but also like [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8651.76s)]
*  they lit a fire under him. And sometimes people need that in life. You know, that's what I think [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8656.0s)]
*  his, I mean, his agent, Bill Duffy is one of the great agents of the last 40 years. He's a hall of [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8661.68s)]
*  fame. I don't know if he's actually in the hall. I don't know if they put agents in the hall. He [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8667.52s)]
*  was more ripped shit than anybody. But what I think would build up, he basically, you know, [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8670.16s)]
*  I shouldn't maybe share everything, but no Bill's thing was they traded you the Lakers. So like, [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8674.24s)]
*  you know, Luca is apps as you can see from the tears, it's like they traded you the Lakers. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8680.64s)]
*  Right. So let's, let's take a step back and evaluate, you know, that you were traded to the [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8686.32s)]
*  Lakers. And I think Luca is coming around on that. We'll find out this summer because he's [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8692.16s)]
*  got to sign the extension. We'll find out in the playoffs how he does and how everything fits in. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8698.56s)]
*  And we're going to find out how the LeBron Luca together, you know, which I think, I think LeBron's [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8703.039999999999s)]
*  handled great so far as it can be a little different in a game four when you're down to one in a series [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8708.64s)]
*  and who gets the bomb. I'm, I can't wait for all that stuff. But isn't this, isn't this like great [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8712.96s)]
*  for LeBron? Like it's great for the league. It's great for us. It's great for LeBron. And LeBron's [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8718.32s)]
*  never been in a situation where he clearly wasn't the most talented guy in his own team. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8723.44s)]
*  Now he's age 40. If this was 2012 LeBron, it'd be a little different, but the only time I can remember [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8729.76s)]
*  even close was that first Miami season, which you covered because Wade was incredible that year. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8735.36s)]
*  LeBron was in his head space, was in a completely different place. And LeBron was, yeah, LeBron was [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8739.68s)]
*  a mess for a variety of reasons and Wade was awesome. That was probably the last great Wade [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8744.16s)]
*  season. Dwayne Wade was so great in that 2011 finals. One of the best that was that game three, [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8748.56s)]
*  he was the game they won. They won game three to go to one. He was awesome in that game. He was, [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8755.439999999999s)]
*  I feel like he's weirdly become underrated now because his prime wasn't kind of as long as it [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8761.52s)]
*  should have been. I've said this and it's kind of laughable, but League Pass wasn't as much of a [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8767.039999999999s)]
*  thing. We couldn't watch it on our phones. But in 2010, when I moved to Miami, obviously Dwayne Wade [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8772.24s)]
*  was already on his way to being a Hall of Famer. He had already been a finals MVP, but until I [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8779.039999999999s)]
*  watched him play 82 games or whatever, he played 75 games night in and night out covering the heat, [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8784.4s)]
*  I didn't appreciate how freaking good he was. Like 25 games into that season as you know, [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8790.72s)]
*  that was very dramatic. I remember thinking, my God, is he good? I know it's kind of weird to say, [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8797.199999999999s)]
*  but I had such an appreciation for how good he was. I remember writing this in 09 when he was [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8804.0s)]
*  stuck on a pretty bad Miami team and he kind of carried them, got them in playoffs. But [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8810.72s)]
*  I just felt like he was as good as Kobe for a couple years there. I have Kobe as one of the [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8815.359999999999s)]
*  10 best players of all time. I wouldn't say that lightly, but I think Wade's best was as good as [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8822.64s)]
*  Kobe's best. And I think you saw it in the 06 finals. If he really wanted to be great, [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8829.279999999999s)]
*  you could really build the right team around him and he could carry somebody to the top of the [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8835.039999999999s)]
*  mountain. Kobe did it way longer. And I think the problem for Wade is he had a six-year peak. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8839.92s)]
*  We got hurt. He got hurt a bunch of times, but his peak was basically from 06 to 11. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8846.0s)]
*  Kobe had the first peak and then had the second peak from like 08 to 2012 where he had almost a [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8851.68s)]
*  whole second career. For sure. And Wade was basically by the 2014 finals, wasn't an impact [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8860.32s)]
*  guy anymore. That's right. That's one of the reasons why LeBron left. I mean, there was a [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8866.32s)]
*  number of reasons why he left, but he was looking over at Dwayne and he was like, I don't, you know. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8870.4s)]
*  I wrote that when it happened. It was always like, he's going back to Cleveland. He's [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8875.92s)]
*  going to be, and I was like, he's dumping this Miami team because he knows, because he's [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8879.84s)]
*  fucking basketball genius. He's like, this is done. I've maximized all of my assets out of this team. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8885.6s)]
*  I'm out. One of my most vivid memories of my 22-year career in the NBA was the locker room [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8892.56s)]
*  after game five of the 2014 finals, the Spurs magical crushed him. Five four one. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8900.16s)]
*  Kawhi was great. The ball's moving. Danny Green doesn't miss for days. We're going to have to [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8909.52s)]
*  dinner that finals. In Miami. Yeah. I'm in the locker room in whatever they called this Spurs or [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8914.0s)]
*  AT&T center, whatever they called it. And baddie retires, which we weren't, which we weren't, um, [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8923.6s)]
*  surprised about. Ray Allen basically retires that one. We were caught. We were caught off guard. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8930.880000000001s)]
*  He was like, he felt like he had like three more years. I thought he had one more at least. Yeah. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8935.68s)]
*  And he was like, yeah, I think I might be done. And we were like, whoa, Bosch is like genuinely [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8939.12s)]
*  relieved. Like not upset. Like, like almost like I've unburdened myself. Haslem. First off, half the [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8945.84s)]
*  team, like half the team is about to retire. Like they don't all know it. Like, um, Richard Lewis [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8955.76s)]
*  doesn't know he's done, but he's done. But like a year later, half the team wasn't in the league. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8960.960000000001s)]
*  And, um, I'll never forget that it was like they were happy. It was over. It was such a finality, [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8967.04s)]
*  like it was almost like senior year. Like, okay guys, four years that were like six years. Exactly. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8973.92s)]
*  And so when you look like LeBron's looking around that room, you know, half the guys are about to [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8979.76s)]
*  retire. You know, Wade is like wheezing. Like they spent the whole year, Tim Grover, who was, you [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8984.800000000001s)]
*  know, Jordan's guy, Tim Grover spent the whole, the whole season in Miami working on Dwayne Wade [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8991.68s)]
*  to get him taped together, to get him to the playoffs. Now he ended up playing a couple more [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=8998.16s)]
*  years, obviously, but like they spent the whole year just trying to keep him together for the [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9004.16s)]
*  playoffs. LeBron is seeing all that. And he's just like, I thought he maybe would have come back for [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9008.16s)]
*  maybe one more year just to, just to see. I remember everyone got mad at me because on TV, [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9012.08s)]
*  Cleveland, the lottery, and, um, I think, which was, I think before the game. And it was in [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9016.560000000001s)]
*  Indianapolis. I, another vivid memory. And LeBron had a weird first half. And I think I said [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9024.0s)]
*  something at halftime, like that was a weird LeBron half. It's almost like it broke his brain that [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9028.72s)]
*  Cleveland was getting the first pick. And that's cause we were talking about that, that whole [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9034.0s)]
*  playoffs, whether he was going to go back there. It wasn't a good lottery. It was the Wiggins [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9037.92s)]
*  lottery. It wasn't like it was an asset to trade. And that was the Kevin Love stuff. It already [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9042.08s)]
*  started. So post game, uh, I can close my eyes and see the locker LeBron sits at. It was, you know, [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9047.76s)]
*  um, I still think about cows win the lottery. He's like, yeah, pretty amazing. Huh? Like it [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9056.64s)]
*  was a little back and forth. Yeah. After that game, like, um, cause they'd won two years in a row [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9062.48s)]
*  and like three out of four or something like that, cause they won the Kyrie, Kyrie, Anthony Bennett, [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9067.36s)]
*  Andrew Wiggins. I got mad on TV and then everyone got mad at me about that. I thought it was [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9072.0s)]
*  outrageous that they won three and four years. We need rules. How is this? Of course it's [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9076.24s)]
*  outrageous. That's allowed. Yes. Of course it's outrageous. Yes. They've done a better job with [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9081.039999999999s)]
*  it now. Like even, you know, Bob Carrington makes a crazy shot. So Utah's one and Washington's two, [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9085.6s)]
*  but they both have 14% odds and it's not as impactful as I think it would have been. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9092.24s)]
*  Having said that there were like eight teams tanking at the end of this year, something like [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9097.039999999999s)]
*  that. Well, the schedule is too long. It just is. This is what happens when you're playing [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9100.56s)]
*  for fucking ever. And you know, you get to mid March and eight teams just want the season to be [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9106.0s)]
*  over. That's true. That's one. Were you touched when, when LeBron took that shot at you and [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9111.28s)]
*  everybody rallied to your defense? It was like, it was a great online moment for you. It was. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9116.72s)]
*  People were very protective of you. I would prefer that it didn't happen. Yeah. But I kind of feel [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9121.92s)]
*  like everybody who knows what's going on knew, but everybody who didn't know will forget. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9127.12s)]
*  So like I, I actually felt like it might've, my concern was that it would damage me with players [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9138.400000000001s)]
*  because he's so influential with players. Yeah. That hasn't been the case so far. I've had more [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9145.12s)]
*  players come up and not that every, not that all of them are, but I've had more support from players [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9149.76s)]
*  current and former than I thought I would get from it. So it's a weird moment. I know to me, [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9155.68s)]
*  I read that as like, man, that's just, he said something and I bet he would take it back a day [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9160.800000000001s)]
*  later. I don't know. Cause I haven't talked to him. I actually haven't seen him since. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9165.6s)]
*  McAfee, I've done McAfee a dozen, I don't know, eight, seven, eight times. There's a McAfee would [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9172.0s)]
*  put up this photo of where he superimposed me as one of his high school teammates. Yeah. He always [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9179.68s)]
*  use that photo was funny. You know, McAfee show has all these tropes that is a trope. He's put that [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9185.44s)]
*  photo up a number of times. I don't know what LeBron was thinking, but I kind of think when he [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9190.560000000001s)]
*  saw that photo go up, he thought that was weird. Well, maybe he thinks I'm weird. Maybe, maybe he [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9196.480000000001s)]
*  does. Let's put it this way. There's probably 15 things LeBron could be angry at me about, like [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9202.32s)]
*  that I've said, or written over the years that he could legitimately be like, that was wrong. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9207.44s)]
*  That was unfair. You don't know what you're talking about. Like, and he could have hit me [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9211.6s)]
*  with any of those. I had been like, you're right. Shouldn't have done that. I was out of line. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9215.2s)]
*  But what he accused me of was not one of them. So, but I kind of, I almost kind of think he saw [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9221.84s)]
*  the photo and thought that was weird. And that's what he was reacting to as if I made the photo or [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9227.04s)]
*  something. Every year you go viral on America's behind you. I don't know. I don't know about that. [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9231.76s)]
*  You don't think so? I think people in media who knew were behind me. I don't know about America. [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9238.4s)]
*  I don't think it was bad for you. No, I don't. It was fine. I, like I said, and I'm not just saying [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9244.0s)]
*  this, like he doesn't know me anything. So it's fine. I don't, it was a great relationship for all [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9250.48s)]
*  sides. Yeah. Well, I don't know how he feels about it, but it was a great relationship for me. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9256.08s)]
*  I do think we are entering in this and we've hit all these different kind of checkpoints with [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9260.48s)]
*  basketball coverage and this whatever era we're in now where fan bases can be mobilized. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9266.24s)]
*  If somebody writes or says something that a player doesn't like that, that's a little hairy. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9272.8s)]
*  Well, I think it's okay for media to be held accountable. I couldn't agree more. We're [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9278.0s)]
*  supposed to be fair and accurate. Yeah, that's fine. But, you know, like [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9283.92s)]
*  it, I don't think there's an understanding of the job. You know, there's not, there's not, [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9289.12s)]
*  that's one thing that's kind of been lost. It's like, even you look at the award stuff, which, [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9297.28s)]
*  you know, Zach just dumped his ballot at it. Eventually he couldn't handle the swings, but [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9302.08s)]
*  I told him that I was annoyed about it and I am annoyed about it and he should get it back. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9307.92s)]
*  But like, you know, Yokojir SGA, it's a good battle. You talk to different people, [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9312.240000000002s)]
*  they're going to say different things. Nobody is going to do an MVP vote. Like I finally, [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9317.2s)]
*  I get to do my anti-OKC agenda. Right. I'm so, I'm so glad. Right. Like I voted for [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9323.12s)]
*  Dort for Defensive Player of the Year and Dagnall for Coach of the Year. I wish I had had the [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9330.320000000002s)]
*  guts to vote for Dort. I said I was, I was seriously thinking about it. I just didn't [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9335.6s)]
*  have the guts. But it's like what they say, like a golfer makes like an 18 footer and a guster. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9339.68s)]
*  Like the guts, the guts to read that. Here's the thing about immediate voting for awards [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9345.28s)]
*  were the best bad, bad, where the, of all the bad options were the best bad option. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9353.04s)]
*  So like, and this is not speculation. They let the fans into the all-star voting. Yeah. And the fans [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9357.92s)]
*  are like trying to vote Zaza Petulia and like, you know, with all due respect to Lamello Ball, [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9365.6s)]
*  he's a great player, but he had no business being a starter in the all-star game this year. He did [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9371.36s)]
*  not. Fans put him in. So the players and the media had to check on that. The players, [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9374.72s)]
*  first off, they vote for all-star and they don't, half of them don't take it seriously. You can see [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9382.72s)]
*  the votes and like, Bob Carrington's getting votes. Yeah. With all due respect to Bob. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9386.16s)]
*  The players' awards, you remember that lasted for like two or three years? That was a disaster. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9389.76s)]
*  Who could have predicted? I mean, it was a disaster when they did it in the 60s and they had people [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9395.039999999999s)]
*  voted for MVP. Some of the votes were, you know, Bill Russell being like fifth. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9399.12s)]
*  Okay. Of course. One of the most amazing awards every year is the executive of the year award. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9404.320000000002s)]
*  Voted by other executives. The other executives vote for it. It's like the pettiest [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9410.640000000001s)]
*  award. Like there's bias and pettiness and like, if you go back and historically look at some of [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9415.28s)]
*  these vote totals, you can't trust that that's the best. Only the NBA governor's meeting is more [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9423.6s)]
*  petty than the, uh, can you imagine? So the players don't trust the owners. The owners don't trust [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9428.16s)]
*  the players. The players can't be trusted to pick the other players. The fans can't be trusted at [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9433.44s)]
*  all. So is the media perfect? Hell no. But we're the best of the options. Well, and also you can't [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9437.119999999999s)]
*  fuck around with your ballot. You can't be like, I'm going to put Bronnie James third for rookie [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9444.4s)]
*  of the year because then it's going to be shown that you did that. I know. And my colleagues don't [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9449.92s)]
*  like that their votes are public. And so I don't care if my vote's public. I, I, I watch [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9454.8s)]
*  basketball year. I really care about the process. I've talked about it forever and I'm going to do [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9461.119999999999s)]
*  my ballot the way I want to do it. I have a whole process and I care. Okay. So hold us [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9466.56s)]
*  accountable. If people disagree with it, that's fine. I, but I do wonder though, if they should [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9470.72s)]
*  make it private and if they don't like certain ballots, just knock those people out for the [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9475.679999999998s)]
*  next year. Well, that is something that could happen. Hold us accountable. Here's why I say [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9482.32s)]
*  that. I worry about the group think for stuff because people are afraid, oh, if I do this and [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9487.76s)]
*  not enough people are with me, then people are going to say whatever. Right. And then if you're [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9493.68s)]
*  just like, ah, it's just safer for me to do this because I don't want to be noticed. That's not, [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9499.36s)]
*  then we're not voting anymore. I do think people do that. Yes. I definitely think that happens. And [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9503.119999999999s)]
*  I think especially with the teams that you have to cover, you know, like if you are right, [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9508.4s)]
*  you've Jaren Jackson, you leave them off 32 mile MBA and then you run into them. Okay. So hey dude, [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9514.16s)]
*  this is one thing that I do. And I did that this year, Evan Moby and Jaren Jackson were, [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9519.039999999999s)]
*  are both guys who, if they may call MBA, get the bonus. Moby is already in his contract. Jackson [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9523.279999999999s)]
*  is eligible for the super max doesn't have it, but he's eligible. So I have a rule that if you're [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9530.0s)]
*  close, I put you on. I did this with Jalen Brown, um, two years ago, Jalen Brown had earned it. He [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9534.32s)]
*  was set. He was on, he was second to Jalen Brown should have been on. He, he earned it. That's a [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9540.48s)]
*  bad example. Well, but Jaren Jackson's an interesting one because I got it. I put him on, I put Zubats [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9543.68s)]
*  over him. It's, and I'm not going to argue that with you. I'm just saying like, I have this rule [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9548.96s)]
*  that if it's close, I give it to him. I can't argue with it. And Evan Moby was on it too. Speaking [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9552.48s)]
*  of arguing, we went way too long and we have to watch him playing basketball again. We now missed [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9556.96s)]
*  the first quarter, but I had a great time. It was good catching up with you. I always love talking [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9560.48s)]
*  to you. Thanks for saying real quick. I don't know if it's still available on the web anywhere. [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9563.76s)]
*  You and I, when you did your book of basketball to what did you call it? Like when you did the podcast, [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9571.04s)]
*  the podcast on YouTube, it's on YouTube. We did the bronze, the shot, right? We did the game seven. [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9578.32s)]
*  Yeah. It's the most fun I've ever had doing a podcast. Oh, that's nice. And is probably [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9583.68s)]
*  the best pot, the best, some of the best content I've ever done. We did it. We did it at the studio, [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9593.76s)]
*  at the Rainier. Pre-COVID. Pre-COVID. I remember like coming across it like during COVID, like in, [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9599.6s)]
*  you know, in the darkest of times and listening to it. So if you are a LeBron fan or a Kyrie fan, [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9605.44s)]
*  just go find that. I mean, all of you did a whole bunch of them because now it's, you know, [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9612.800000000001s)]
*  half a decade old or longer, but like, I just want to say. Oh, I'm glad. Well, you were great on that [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9616.56s)]
*  one. That was a really fun one. I loved it. So, okay. All right. Great to see you. [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v975aLziFyI&t=9620.64s)]
