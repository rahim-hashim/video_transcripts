# Just How Bad is the 2024 NBA Draft? And What Should the Hawks Do? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmVNmKVE8lc)
*  All right.
*  The lottery was today.
*  I don't know why I was on a Sunday, but that was weird.
*  I thought the telecast was just all time bizarre.
*  We didn't even know that the number 13 team jumped.
*  I don't know if they said it.
*  Um, then it was just more chaos than the top four than I think we've had in a while.
*  And if there was ever a time to spend 10 minutes with people who know what they're
*  talking about, about the draft and what teams landed where that that would have
*  been the time to hear it, but we had to interview all the draft picks, but
*  for, for the first 15 minutes of the show that, which I don't know who wants that.
*  I can't name one person.
*  I just want to know who won the lottery.
*  Give me immediate expert thoughts from people.
*  What it means.
*  Atlanta.
*  I thought scoot looked great.
*  Scoot our guy.
*  I was happy for him.
*  Atlanta jumps into the top four and then the top one.
*  They had the second worst odds, 3%.
*  They got the first pick for the first time since 1975, David Thompson, who
*  ended up never playing there.
*  One of the weirder drafts because the eBay was involved.
*  Um, so we'll go on the ramifications of that, but then our, the rockets jumped
*  to three and then the spurs locked down for, so we go Hawks, wizards, rocket spurs.
*  Everybody knows this is listening.
*  This is by all accounts.
*  Um, one of the worst three drafts the last 25 years.
*  It's a draft.
*  Somebody who knows the draft said it would be a draft.
*  If you took a normal draft and you just chopped the top three guys out of it.
*  So the normal top three you would have were like the, Oh, that guy might be a
*  superstar, whoo, this guy look out for him.
*  He's got all the tools and he just took those three guys out and started the
*  draft at four where like Deandre Hunter gets picked or Alex Len, like those kind
*  of picks, that's what this draft is.
*  It just kind of starts there at four.
*  Um, what have you heard about the lottery?
*  And I mean, we could go into all the ramifications of like the Hawks getting
*  the first picture to blow it up for, but what does it even mean to get the first
*  pick?
*  So I texted after the lottery was settled.
*  I text like, I heard from eight teams that I texted a few more, but hey, it's
*  Mother's Day and you saying this is like starting at four.
*  That's the nicest thing that I've heard because my responses from front office
*  people today was far worse than that.
*  Like starting at six, starting at eight.
*  One team said, our analytics staff does like a projected value on like what this
*  player is coming in for the people that are in the conversation with your number
*  one.
*  Um, this team said that their team suggested it's like the seventh or eighth
*  pick owning the first pick this year in a normal draft.
*  Um, I asked another team, I said, what kind of player could you get in a trade
*  for the number one pick?
*  And he said, maybe the fourth or fifth starter on a decent team.
*  And so like that was a little hard.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  No one said Lou door in particular, but yes, that's a good, like Derek whites and
*  no.
*  Right.
*  So Atlanta says, Hey Boston, we'll give you the number one pick for Derek white
*  and Boston hangs up.
*  Right.
*  Hangs out.
*  Okay.
*  I had another guy say the Clippers are like Terrence man.
*  No way.
*  Hang up.
*  Seriously, Bill.
*  Like that's kind of the vibe that I got from all of these people.
*  Like I was asking, I was like, give me a good name, like give me somebody.
*  Give me a good name.
*  I had another guy say it's like starting to draft at 10th.
*  And I was like, all right, that's the worst thing that I had heard from today.
*  Um, here was a name.
*  It's like, would the Knicks do some, but see here's the, there's the Atlanta
*  problem.
*  Okay.
*  So just in a vacuum, what does this pick worth on the open market?
*  But then there's the Atlanta problem about what they're going to try to do.
*  But like, say the Knicks, like would you do Julius Reign?
*  Julius Randall.
*  But then it's like, okay, so what are we going to do?
*  Trade some foreign guy who's the number one overall pick the Tibbs so he can rot
*  the bench for a year by Jericho Sims.
*  Cause Tibbs hates them.
*  So I don't think.
*  So like the number one pick for Deandre Hunter and Mikhail, the number one pick
*  with Deandre Hunter for Mikhail Bridges is an immediate no from Brooklyn.
*  Like no way.
*  Yeah.
*  Cam Johnson.
*  Now, now maybe we can talk because then I asked somebody else, I was like, give
*  me comps on the top because I haven't done any work.
*  I've debated sitting this draft out.
*  I think you should set it out.
*  Maybe just get into, I'd make revolutionary war.
*  Maybe Nick make another run.
*  I have a lot.
*  So he was saying this is essentially like a Derek Lively or Tobias Harris being
*  the number one pick in the draft.
*  This is what we're talking about.
*  But that would make sense if you said cut the top 10 off.
*  Derek Lively was like the 11th pick.
*  And Harris was just outside of that.
*  Was Harris 18 actually?
*  He might've gone later.
*  Cause I remember being like, Hey, he's too good to go that late.
*  Was I right or wrong?
*  I don't know.
*  Well, Atlanta getting it.
*  It's too bad.
*  The draft's not good because it would have made them an intriguing blow it up team.
*  19.
*  The, uh, Harris was 19.
*  Did you know the number one pick has only been traded three times?
*  I do now.
*  1990, 1993, 2017.
*  I am leaning toward Atlanta being not a blow it up team, but a pick between
*  Murray and young and just take whoever they think is the best guy and try to be
*  decent because San Antonio has their pick next year.
*  So blowing it up, I don't know what that does for them because next year's
*  draft is, is awesome by all accounts.
*  And I don't know why you'd want to blow it up when you don't have your pick
*  unless one of those two guys was going to San Antonio and you can get your
*  pick back, then blow it up would make sense.
*  So I don't know.
*  I'm not to tell you, Tray's making 43, 45 and 47 next three years.
*  Murray's making 25, 27, 29, 31.
*  They got Capella 22.
*  They have a conglut at a first of four years, starting at 14 hunters at 21,
*  23, 24 next three years, bogged down in rich 17 and 16.
*  They also have Jalen Johnson, a couple of young guards.
*  And I love Jalen Johnson.
*  He's one of my favorite stories of this past year.
*  Like I'm going through some more, I text here, another team front office guy was
*  like, could you do a first to the heat for Jimmy Butler, but you have to give
*  Butler the extension and granted that means money going out too.
*  So I'm not going to get the trade machine.
*  So we have to like Hunter and Bogdanovich for Jimmy Butler.
*  You throw in the first pick.
*  But then you go, well, that's not the way Riley operates, right?
*  Like what if Brandon Ingram now is available?
*  It's like, so what are the Pelicans do?
*  Do you add another pick from the draft that nobody likes?
*  Like would Chicago do something?
*  And it's like, none of these guys are worth blowing it up.
*  So I think what ends up happening, this would just be my guess.
*  It's still probably cooler to go, what if we're all wrong?
*  And one of these guys is being really good and we guess right.
*  So why don't we just keep that first overall pick?
*  But the Hawks, I think the Hawks ended up making it so much different.
*  If it was Washington and they go, Hey dude, these pieces that are being
*  offered back to us, it doesn't even make any sense for us.
*  We're not any good.
*  We want to be bad next year anyway, for group of flag.
*  So what's the point?
*  We'll just take the guy and we're going to keep it because it's just cooler to
*  say, Hey, we took the number one guy in the draft this year and, and maybe we're
*  all wrong and we get surprised because we're surprised all the time in this
*  process, but for Atlanta, it's you're right.
*  I think they have to figure out the Trey Murray thing.
*  Well, he trained, he changed agents last week.
*  Kim and Murray were both clutch now Trey is CAA.
*  And it now it's really, it's really starting to come out in public that those
*  guys didn't like playing with each other.
*  So they got to pick one.
*  Well, no, they, people don't like playing with Trey.
*  I don't know how many times, how many years I'm going to keep saying this.
*  When they trade them, maybe finally people that have argued with me about this for
*  years, who have apparently zero information will basically, let me just put it this
*  way, I'm not going to be a Dick when the day comes, but understand I'll be smiling
*  and in solidarity, there's no Miami possibility for him.
*  Is there?
*  Oh, I think that's, that's a good guess that Miami just goes, Hey, you know, we
*  know how to do things.
*  We're better.
*  We're, you know, the whole Miami spiel to him.
*  You know, what's crazy is I'll never forget, um, you know, certain blind spots
*  that you can have sometimes as a man.
*  We were like, wait, is that something that happens?
*  Like, I don't know that that happens because I've only been a man.
*  And there was a headline.
*  Okay.
*  There was a headline, um, but Zach arts tight end.
*  Yeah.
*  The NFL is his wife is her name.
*  Is it Julie?
*  Really?
*  It's soccer.
*  Right.
*  Great soccer player.
*  And there was a headline that was like Zach Earth's wife describes whatever,
*  whatever, whatever.
*  And it was, once that headline came out, it was, it was fucking on.
*  It was like, she has a name.
*  She has a thing is she's accomplished enough that you would go.
*  She'd earned Julia status.
*  She earns Julia status, but the way it was being brought up, I was like, wait, is
*  there, is there something here that I've never noticed before?
*  Is this a misogynistic thing that happens with headlines?
*  And so I started paying attention to it was keeping logs.
*  And what I learned is it doesn't have anything to do with that.
*  Google doc, like a Microsoft word.
*  Yeah.
*  Just, well, actually long form.
*  I got this new tablet.
*  Okay.
*  So I promised there's a connection here.
*  Once I started tracking it, I was like, it actually has everything to do with
*  fame and what level of fame you're at or not.
*  And whoever made that shitty headline decided at that point that the NFL
*  player was the more recognizable name.
*  I remember when Meek Mill got into a fight with Nicki Minaj's fiance, it was
*  Meek Mill gets into altercation with Nicki Minaj's fiance, and it was just
*  that guy wasn't famous enough.
*  So he got left out and the other two people were mentioned.
*  Um, if you were to say, get arrested, it may say ESPN host arrested.
*  If you're not famous enough.
*  Um, the point that I'm making here is I saw a link today that said.
*  $250 million all star, not likely to go to Lakers based on news from today.
*  And I'm like, Trey young couldn't even get his name in a Lakers media piece.
*  That was the headline.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So I'm just telling you, it happens to everybody.
*  It's just a level of fame and Trey young is famous enough to have been in that
*  headline and Julia.
*  I mean, I think that's one of the things that I've noticed in the
*  Lakers is that the Lakers is certainly famous enough.
*  Others, not as famous.
*  I like how you brought that around.
*  And it's something I've been passionate about for awhile as well.
*  I've noticed on the AOL home screen 20 years ago, you'd be like, uh, NFL,
*  you know, running back found dead and it'd be like, oh my God, who was it?
*  And then it would be somebody you'd never heard of.
*  Yeah.
*  So I was like, you know, if you look at the Lakers star snaps at press and then
*  the Lakers star will be, you know, like Christian.
*  Hey, yeah.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Exactly.
*  Lakers star.
*  It'll be like former clipper.
*  They'll always be like a real estate thing.
*  Like former clipper star buys Palace Verde is a state and you're like, it's
*  like Bobby Simmons and you just go.
*  So there is, I'm glad you're as passionate about this.
*  No, I love it.
*  It took me awhile to get there, but I just.
*  I was trying to figure out a nets, Nick's hawks trade, lay them on me.
*  Cause I'm too dismissive when we have this, just a little heads up, and I will apologize to you.
*  When we do this exercise, I got to have a more open mind.
*  Well, cause we have so many trades.
*  Well, I guess that where I was landed was I had eight possible tray young teams, Miami,
*  the Clippers, New Orleans, the Spurs, who I think I've already said they're not interested.
*  The magic, the nets, Washington, and the Lakers and the Lakers would be stupid.
*  But if there's a net snakes, Hawks trade that where I'm really going with this mentally is.
*  How do we get McKell bridges to the Knicks?
*  Cause I don't think the nets will just trade him to the Knicks for picks.
*  Like they, you know, they have all their, they have their picks going to Houston and
*  they're going to want people back who are actually going to be competent.
*  So not just like, here's McKell bridges, give us picks back.
*  It needs to be some sort of three-way trade.
*  And is there a way tray young could go to Brooklyn and bridges could go to the Knicks
*  and then maybe Randall and picks goes to the Hawks or there's some sort of arrangement
*  where everybody's happy, which leads to the second question is,
*  are we even sure the Knicks want to trade Randall?
*  Do they look at what's happened in the playoffs and say to themselves,
*  man, if we'd had Randall, we could have made the finals.
*  And I think they do like Randall more than most, but I just like the idea of bridges
*  with the Villanova thing. I was talking to Nick's fan about it, about how special those three guys
*  are together. And they've talked about it, about how when you win a title like that,
*  and it could be in high school, it could be fucking college, wherever it is, like the connection and
*  the chemistry you have is just completely different. There's a trust and a confidence.
*  Those three guys have, and reps with each other. That's really special. And I think that's one of
*  the reasons you and I who care less about the Knicks, it's fun to watch Brunson, but it's also
*  really fun to watch those three guys and Brunson's kicking. D'Fincenzo is just moving to this spot in
*  the corner and Brunson doesn't even have to look over. He just knows exactly where he's going to be.
*  And it'd be like, how cool would it be to also put bridges in there? Who's like the fourth guy who
*  thinks like those guys. So if I was the Knicks, that's what I'd go after. It's like, how do we
*  add bridges to this? Cause remember we were talking the other day about who would have made sense to
*  add to this? Would you add Donovan Mitchell to this? Would it be too weird? Would you trade
*  everything? Mitchell thinks as much as I like him, it doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make sense for what this is,
*  what, how they're built, but bridges does make sense. So that got me thinking there's some sort
*  of three way thing. That would be my main preference. I also am really interested with the magic with
*  Trey. I think for selfish reasons, cause of our guys, Saruti, having him go through the day to day
*  Trey Young experience would be really fun. But I also think that's the kind of guy they need.
*  And maybe as he gets older, they could hide them defensively in some ways.
*  I think Trey needs to go somewhere where he respects someone else on the team. And if he
*  goes to Orlando, it's just going to be the Florida version of the Hawks. Everybody else will get worse.
*  Well, the most fun for you and I would be Clippers for Paul George, a sign in trade. And then we got
*  to watch Trey Young and Hardin together. That would be the most fun just personally for me,
*  from a comedic standpoint. No, I would love to hear Lakers fans that never watch him play
*  talk about how they're the favorites and then people on TV talk about how they might be the
*  favorite and then have it not work out. And then here behind the scenes, LeBron never liked to trade
*  in the first place. LeBron never liked to trade. But now that the clutch part, the clutch part
*  hasn't happened though. Like clutch part of it, you know, before it felt like they couldn't make
*  it happen when he was on clutch. Yeah. So well, the other guy that's out there is Ingram and New
*  Orleans has a million picks. And that's one where you could talk yourself into. They keep Murray,
*  they add Ingram, they add a bunch of picks. Trey Young goes to New Orleans. That gets a little
*  weird with Zion and, and you know, do you want Trey to have the ball that much?
*  Okay. But here's the thing. You might be onto something there. Thank you. And it's not just
*  Trey being the best lob guy in the league to Zion, which would be a lot of fun. And to Trey Murphy.
*  But if you go Trey Murphy, Herb Jones, Zion around Trey, and I think Zion became passable defensively
*  with an all defensive player like Herb, and I think Murphy will get better. They still got to
*  figure out what they want to do with this Valencianist Larry Nance thing. There might be enough
*  defense around Trey now to maybe get away with it. And maybe a Kang Wu's in that trade.
*  You know, I like a Kang Wu. So, and because they, the funny thing about, they probably wouldn't do
*  that. They probably, yeah. Well, the funny thing about them getting the number one pick is people
*  think the center, Saar is going to be the first pick. And that's like the one position, Atlanta.
*  They don't need point guards or centers, right? They need everybody else in between.
*  But the center seems like the logical pick. Yeah. There's like an Ingram and Hawk.
*  Well, that's why the Spurs, like if the Spurs had won the lottery today, I'm like,
*  what are they going to do? Now granted they could trade it.
*  Right. Well, we should talk about them though, because that was one of the important things
*  that happened. The Raptors had the top six protected pick. They go into the lottery six,
*  they fall back to eight and the Yacapyrdl trade just becomes a mass murder at that point. Now,
*  number eight in this draft might be number 17 in normal drafts. Maybe it doesn't matter that much,
*  but it just sucks to lose a first round pick when you had a shitty season. So San Antonio is four
*  and eight. And when they take like Toronto's tanking, they tanked hard. Yeah. They won the
*  tanking championship. But no one likes, I should say, Derrushape love Yacapyrdl as much as Toronto.
*  So they're probably like, Hey, we love the guy. Yeah. We're so happy we had him. We wouldn't have
*  been able to go 29 and 53 without him. So San Antonio has got four and eight. There's a French
*  wing guy. I'm not going to try to pronounce his name. And there's three point guards
*  that will go, uh, Nicola Topic, Topic. We know how to say his name. The point, he's like a dragage
*  type of point guard, lefty, uh, Dillingham and Shepard. And it feels like all three of those
*  point guards are going to be top eight picks. So the Spurs can get one of those guys and maybe
*  the French guy. I don't know. I just want the Spurs to get creators, people who are fun to play
*  with. People who are inclusive. People know how to throw a fucking entry pass. People who can just
*  like, I want two guys who can kill one B. Yeah. Can you throw an entry pass? Can you throw a
*  lab pass? Can you cut without the ball? Um, does the ball move when you get it? That's what they
*  should be looking for. But those, those are nice picks. But if also, if they wanted to make a trade
*  and package those two as some of the other stuff they have, they could get pretty aggressive.
*  Somebody wanted to blow it up. It seems like Detroit wants to trade number five because
*  they're tired of taking young guys. And then the, uh, the other big one was, um,
*  was Houston jumped to three. Houston from an asset standpoint,
*  Shen Gun, Van Blee, Brooks, Jabari, who I really thought I liked the season he had,
*  Jalen Green, Thompson, Whitmore, third pick. They have Brooklyn's first in 26. They can swap them
*  in 27. Pretty good, pretty good spot for a mega trade if they're thinking about it.
*  How about that story about how, uh, Stone asked the nets, like, do you want your pits picks back
*  for your Phoenix picks? Is that true? I saw it. I don't know. I mean,
*  you're right. If I brought it up, I probably should have checked it out. No, that's, that would be,
*  which, which picks would you rather have? Cause the Phoenix picks, there's four of them.
*  There's three, three firsts in a swap. And then
*  Brooklyn's got, uh, next year, 26 firsts, and then a swap in 27. So I guess there's more Phoenix picks.
