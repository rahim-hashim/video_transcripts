# Were Franz Wagner and Scottie Barnes Drastic Overpays?  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [July 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDLG-CKKs4I)
*  You want to go Franz extension or Scotty Barnes extension or both?
*  I think they're both. I think it's a both topic. I did a lot of work on this. So
*  Oh, you did. I figured I uh, I I did not like either extension at all
*  And for two reasons one is I don't think those guys are max players and two
*  I don't understand the point of doing it a year early
*  When we just saw philly with maxi be like hold on man, we're giving you the contract just wait a year
*  It gives us more flexibility a year from now
*  signings the whole thing and also like deep down if it doesn't go awesome, it's
*  Kind of easier as a trade asset
*  Barnes I just don't get it all they're basically saying this is the face of our franchise and they we've just not seen them win with them
*  Franz we can talk about but I the franz I I honestly was stunned
*  Because I just don't think he's a max player. So you're more stunned by franz than scotty barnes. I was I was stunned by franz
*  I would have waited a year
*  seen if he could shoot threes better
*  and just seen
*  Seen what improved in year four the fact that they did it a year early. I just didn't get it
*  Most do what a year early when it feels like this is the max guy. So the maxi or edwards or yeah, but
*  Franz wagner averaging 19 and five that that's where I maybe draw the line
*  And people could say that with maxi, but maxi took another jump beyond
*  I mean of all the things that more he's done here maxi being that is the 21st pick is like
*  That's such an incredible win to add somebody who's a flirtation all nba guy may be moving forward
*  I mean, I know the guard position is stacked or whatever, but like I voted him as a starter for the all-star team
*  You know, I didn't I mean even even the best version of max would be like, oh, yeah a couple years into this
*  This is the kind of neighborhood that he's going to be in. I mean, that's incredible. So normally
*  I
*  Don't know what the maxi number would have been but they were smart to hold off on the whole thing and I agree like
*  It would seem to just allow you a little bit more flexibility
*  But it feels like there are certain players that are anointed that you just know that you're giving them the max number
*  And it's the same thing with the lanzo ball
*  Deal where he does it what a year early for the five years and two hundred four million or something like that
*  The other yeah, I said lanzo my bad. Um
*  The other problem with the path but with palo you do it like it's like yeah, I get it
*  I was in the moment you could do it tatum you do it edwards you do it
*  I just don't think when you get to the barns france level
*  I'm gonna do it
*  When it's the right year to do it. Why am I doing it a year early scotty has a better argument for it than franz does
*  But let's go let's go over a couple things here. All right
*  Yeah, lamella was five years 204 million. That was last year. So this number is five years
*  225 million for barns. The problem is that the agents want to report it as five years 270 million
*  And that's if they were to be all mba mvp or defensive player of the year, which barns actually
*  Like there's there's a case to be made that if he keeps improving that maybe he ends up on a third team all mba
*  Certainly more so than franz at this point
*  So the 270 numbers the first number that you see on both of these players you're going like what the hell like look at that
*  Really? Yeah, right. It's 225 million
*  So if it's
*  Barns making 10 million this year because it's the fourth year of the rookie deal, which is the second club option
*  There's no options on scotty's deal
*  And the way this works is that we know that the max players 35 or 30 percent of the cap the supermax is 35 percent
*  Well on these rookie max extensions, it's 25 percent of the cap
*  So if the cap continues to go from 140 where it's at now
*  To what would be the fifth year of scotty barns
*  Deal and I just did like average 10 million a year up in cap probably goes up more than that. It's 190 million
*  So you're still only paying like
*  just over
*  25 percent of your cap number to that player so as
*  As absurd as the numbers may be for barns when the extension kicks in at 38 42 45 50
*  48 and then 51 million and 29 30
*  Okay, so
*  30
*  Okay
*  It's it's not we have to remind ourselves. It's not 51 million of the 140 million dollar cap
*  It's 51 million of 190 million dollar cap and that's the cap where basically every team's going to be way over the cap in the first place
*  So if you feel like the player has a chance to be the face of the franchise
*  Which may say more about the rest of the raptors roster where I did the numbers on that like this year with brown
*  rj barrett and
*  Quickly it's going to be like 78 million with those players and then when brown's off the books and it's rj quickly
*  And then barns it's like a hundred million or 90 million 90. I think it's 99 million for those three players
*  You're going man. You might be paying the wrong three players. So oh you think
*  Yes, I do it's why I brought it up it's why I brought it up but
*  This falls into that category of transactions that happen in the league that I know you despise
*  and it's the
*  Hey, make sure you take care of our guy
*  Do it a year ahead of time. Let's not bullshit this nobody ever seems to want to say hey
*  We really like you scotty barnes. You're awesome, but you're not a max guy yet
*  Or even better with franz. So why don't we do like five years 180?
*  For whatever reason which I think has more to do with the relationships and the front offices and the long-term playing with all
*  The stuff it's kind of sometimes the team's fear of pissing off their guy
*  And not going like where this is the celtics with jaylen was a good example of this the first contract they gave not the second one
*  Right. They signed them a year early. They took care of them, but they got kind of a pretty good deal on it
*  And as the years passed
*  Jaylen knows he has a deal on it, right? He has whoever his agent was who made the deal
*  You have the other agents go and you realize you
*  That deals way too low like you shoot you really you made a huge mistake, right? So now it's in his head
*  I'm underpaid this sucks
*  and I think that's one of the many reasons why they were like, you know what we're not going to haggle with jaylen whether it's
*  285 290 or 300 like let's pay him the guy deserves it
*  I think that the case against everything you laid out is what philly did with maxi last year
*  Because
*  They're like, yeah
*  We're gonna take care of you just keep getting better give us a year just trust us
*  And I don't know why like toronto could have done that with scotty burns
*  Because they weren't gonna have the kind of cap space that philly was projecting like this entire
*  24 summer for mori was about preserving this cap space. It's why they didn't do anything. I don't think those guys are why they didn't take back
*  But a max guy we left that playoff series last year wondering like
*  it
*  Like what's up with franz like what if if franz just never learns how to shoot threes, what the hell is he?
*  He's still pretty good
*  Yeah, but could he be a top three guy on a like a real title team if he can't make threes?
*  I don't know
*  I just think the maxi thing is you're right
*  But it was so specific to what their cap situation was going to be
*  That if philly didn't have the cap room or weren't they weren't planning it out the way they were where they didn't take anything back
*  But hardened's deal that was going to linger like he was clearing the decks hoping that apollo george would be available and it worked
*  Maybe with that part of it where maxi's representation can understand hey, we're going to be doing this because we're better
*  We're going to take care of you. We're going to give you the max deal, but the cap hold is going to be so much smaller
*  don't take the extension now and
*  Where barnes and and franz are like look orlando spent their cap space
*  They spent their cap space on kcp and resigning their own guys toronto has all of these guys that they've traded for that
*  They decided to pay. Um, I feel like we've had the same convo every summer
*  And the question is always asked and my answer is always the same because the question is always well, what are you gonna do?
*  Like you gotta sign these guys right and it's like well
*  Okay, we asked that was zach levin
*  Now this isn't like zach levin level because they they had a year that could either be this year or next year when they did
*  the extension but the zach levin and bradley bill are the two best examples of
*  Well, what are we gonna do? You gotta you gotta sign them, right?
*  It's like well, do you think chicago would do the zach levin thing over again?
*  Like it was way too much money for him and now they can't trade him
*  And I just feel like i'm not 100 sure franz
*  um
*  Can live up to this contract
*  I like him. I think he's a good player
*  I had him on my top 100 list. I had him as like the 68th best player in the week
*  But you know, I just look at like what like somebody like austin reeves who we felt like took less than he was worth when he
*  Did that lakers deal last year?
*  There's some sort of middle ground between reeves didn't get enough
*  But I feel like those franz barnes contracts are just too high. I just
*  I just don't get it. Well reeves is in a tougher spot because of where he was drafted
*  and his contract wasn't
*  Structured in the beginning the same way a guy like a lottery pick like franz is where it's very clear
*  Like this is what you're gonna make these are the two club options
*  You go to fifth year restricted. It just doesn't seem to happen. So there has to be a reason why it doesn't happen
*  There's a reason why teams don't want to mess with their lottery pick the same way the timberwolves did with kevin love
*  Where they tried to be cute about it, but we didn't like that neither of us like that when it happened
*  Because it was like well, especially with kevin love because he's an all-in-ba player. What are you guys doing fucking sign up?
*  Yeah, that's a little different franz. I'm not sure he's there
