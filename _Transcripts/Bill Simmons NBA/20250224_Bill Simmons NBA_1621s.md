# Bigger Threat: Lakers or Warriors? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g)
*  So I want to talk about intriguing subplots with 30 games left. Um, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=0.0s)]
*  and some of them are easy to figure out and some of them are a little harder to [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=4.5s)]
*  figure out, but the number one subplot to me, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  and I can't believe I'm even saying this and it makes me mad that we're in this [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=9.44s)]
*  position, but what can you do? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=13.36s)]
*  I think the Lakers are the number one subplot to watch over the next 30 games. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=15.52s)]
*  The Denver game was so interesting last night to see like the real Luca in a, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=19.6s)]
*  in a Lakers game and to watch, you know, their centers, whatever, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=23.76s)]
*  they're just double teaming. Yoke edge. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=28.88s)]
*  They're just going to be happy with Westbrook and those like whoever fine shoot [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=30.4s)]
*  16 for 41 from three. We don't care. We got to take out Yoke edge. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=34.36s)]
*  But the thing that I really noticed that people talked about when they made the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=37.76s)]
*  trade was just 48 minutes of Luca and LeBron or Luca [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=41.32s)]
*  or LeBron, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=46.8s)]
*  but you always have somebody out there who just has this crazy IQ and is a [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=47.92s)]
*  really good offensive player. And, um, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=52.76s)]
*  I've never wavered from thinking Luca was going to be awesome on this team. Uh, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  I just thought it was scary last night. And if I'm in the West, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=62.2s)]
*  I think there's four teams that can win the title and we can talk about a couple [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=65.88s)]
*  of wildcards. I think the Lakers are an official wildcard for me. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=68.44s)]
*  I agree. And it's the defensive numbers. Like you mentioned it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=72.68s)]
*  If you go back the last 15, that's the number one defense in the league. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=75.16s)]
*  They're 12 and three is the best record over the last 15. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=78.28s)]
*  The offense is top 10. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  What's your explanation for that other than just they're playing hard? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=82.56s)]
*  Well, I think having some of the pieces, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=87.04s)]
*  I thought really played his ass off last night, both. I mean, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=90.92s)]
*  you can look at the points, but it was what he was doing defensively. Now, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=94.2s)]
*  granted Vando comes in and just hacks and shit out of Jokic, but you know, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=97.08s)]
*  it's like, they're not going to call all of these, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=100.4s)]
*  although they tried to call all of them on Vinterberg because he didn't play a [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=101.68s)]
*  ton of minutes, but you know, the camera-ish thing seems over. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  The Dalton connect minutes are limited if you start looking at these things. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=109.12s)]
*  So I think we gave Vincent being healthy with Vando being healthy with them [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=112.2s)]
*  liking this Rui center matchup stuff because they're basically forced to figure [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=115.68s)]
*  this out because the Jackson Hayes minutes usually aren't that great because [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=119.92s)]
*  of the longer he's out there, the longer there's just going to be something that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=123.16000000000001s)]
*  happens. And specific to last night, Bill, I loved that game. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=125.64000000000001s)]
*  Okay. I thought it was really impressive. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=130.72s)]
*  Cause we look at the playoff and you go bracket wise, like how far can LA go? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  As I will, they're going to run it to Denver again. So that's not going to work. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=137.0s)]
*  And last night's one result, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=139.88s)]
*  but I thought this coaching staff showed the difference where it's always about [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=141.32s)]
*  the roster for me. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=144.8s)]
*  But there are little times like Kenny Atkinson this year with Cleveland, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=146.12s)]
*  like clearly there's something better with this, with his approach to basketball. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=148.52s)]
*  I think JJ and the staff did such a fantastic job of last night's preparation. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=152.12s)]
*  The possessions, when you really looked at what they were doing, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  there's these non-spacing lineups that Denver runs out there outside of Yoke [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=160.16000000000003s)]
*  itch, where the Lakers are like, if this is what you're going to run out, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=163.88000000000002s)]
*  like we are not going to pay attention to Aaron Gordon. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=167.32000000000002s)]
*  We're not going to care about Westbrook. They had a play and I'll finish here, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=169.52s)]
*  but LeBron was on Yoke itch kind of in the paint left side. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=173.12s)]
*  Dalton is in the dunker spot, ignoring Aaron Gordon. Okay. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  He's basically under the rim. The other two wing players to the right, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=180.72s)]
*  the Lakers defenders are in the paint. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=185.52s)]
*  So that's four players in the paint against Yoke itch. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=187.24s)]
*  The only one that was providing any spacing was Michael Porter Jr. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=189.56s)]
*  at the top of the key and Rui was defending him, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=192.8s)]
*  but Rui was only like a foot beyond the free throw line. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=195.12s)]
*  And you saw possession after possession, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=198.16s)]
*  where you could see the Lakers like specifically the way they prepped that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=201.16s)]
*  game last night. I think that's a credit to JJ and the staff going, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=205.11999999999998s)]
*  we've got to come up with something new that's Yoke itch specific. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=209.56s)]
*  And it worked in, you know, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=213.0s)]
*  really wasn't much of a game on top of all the Lucas stuff that I know you want [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=214.44s)]
*  to get to. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=217.16s)]
*  Well, they did the same thing that that Celtics game that we both went to in LA [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=218.2s)]
*  where they kicked the Celtics ass and part of it was they just were really well [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=222.67999999999998s)]
*  prepared and they used a bunch of things against the Celtics that I'd kind of [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=227.16s)]
*  been waiting for, you know, somebody to do. It's like, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=231.24s)]
*  Oh, you're going to try to force it to Prozingis. Great. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=237.0s)]
*  That's going to throw your whole team out of whack. Like keep, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=239.4s)]
*  keep giving the ball and Prozingis had a good first quarter and nobody else did. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=241.6s)]
*  And then it's like, Oh, here's the top of the second quarter. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=244.96s)]
*  This is when Jalen tries to get his offense for six minutes. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=247.32s)]
*  We're going to make it really hard for him. And it was just, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=250.12s)]
*  you were just watching it going, Oh, this team's got their shit together. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=252.56s)]
*  Last night against Denver, you would think, well, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=255.88s)]
*  why doesn't everybody do that against Jokic? First of all, it's hard to do it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  Second of all, it's hard to commit to it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=262.24s)]
*  And your guys have to be really disciplined with it, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=263.88s)]
*  but they also have smart players. Like everyone makes fun of Lucas defense, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=265.96s)]
*  but he's still a really smart basketball player, right? LeBron, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=269.52s)]
*  I think has been noticeably better on defense for what a month and a half now. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=273.56s)]
*  I don't know what the timeline is, but yeah. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=279.4s)]
*  We were the first month of the season where it was like, Oh my God, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=280.24s)]
*  he's just not playing. He's a DH now. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=283.15999999999997s)]
*  Now he's really active and they just have size and physicality that I think [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=285.56s)]
*  they do. You saw it against the Celtics. They bullied the Celtics now, you know, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=291.0s)]
*  slightly different team. But, um, when they have those, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=294.76000000000005s)]
*  when they have Rui and LeBron and Luke all together, like those, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=297.92s)]
*  that's like 800 pounds of dudes. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=300.92s)]
*  So are you in, are you in, are they the, your fifth team? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=303.88s)]
*  Are they the first team outside of your tier one playoff, like title? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=306.76000000000005s)]
*  I wrote down. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=312.20000000000005s)]
*  You teared us up. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  No, I wrote down things I like about them. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=314.76000000000005s)]
*  And the number one thing is just always having Luke or LeBron out there. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=317.0s)]
*  One of the two or both, I think it's just, it's just really hard to play them. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=320.32s)]
*  You don't have a moment like you had with the Knicks today where Brunston has to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=324.6s)]
*  sit down. It's like, all right, it's campaign time. Cross your fingers. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=328.04s)]
*  Like the Lakers just never have that. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=331.72s)]
*  Campaign was nice though. That first shift. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=333.36s)]
*  He was, he made three in a row. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=335.44s)]
*  That's probably the best thing ever for a Knicks opponent. Like, Hey, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=336.88s)]
*  don't forget like tight game, second half campaign made three in a row in the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=339.96000000000004s)]
*  first half. So that's good for us. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  He's going to think he can get to 20. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=344.76s)]
*  The fact that the defensive numbers are like, if they were ninth or 11th, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=348.36s)]
*  the Lakers, I'd be like, okay, that's a little fluky. There's probably some, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=352.44s)]
*  when you're in the top five, when you're in top three, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=356.88s)]
*  like that's not fluky at some point. I think JJ is a legitimately good coach. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=359.36s)]
*  And I thought what they did last night to, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=365.44s)]
*  to Joker who was terrible because they made him terrible. But then you just look [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=367.68s)]
*  at it. It's just that at some point it's math. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=371.91999999999996s)]
*  Last night LeBron and Luca had 59, 19 and 12. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=374.52s)]
*  If you're going to get numbers that look like that from your best two guys, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=378.76s)]
*  you're going to be heard from, from a couple of playoff rounds. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=381.91999999999996s)]
*  So if I was a Laker fan, I'd be excited, but this is why we all went nuts. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=384.08s)]
*  When the trade happened, this is fucking crazy. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=387.88s)]
*  You don't just get to add the fourth best guy on your team, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=390.2s)]
*  in the league to your team, just, you know, for Anthony Davis, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=393.56s)]
*  the super max Christie, who by the way has been playing great. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=396.48s)]
*  Yeah, he has been good. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=399.24s)]
*  I think some of the worst anti LeBron content that I've ever seen was Lucas [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=400.68s)]
*  stat lines. Those first three games with LeBron. Like I get, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=406.76s)]
*  if you hate LeBron, you hate LeBron, Brett, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=410.48s)]
*  come up with better evidence than that. Cause I went to the Lucas first game, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=413.16s)]
*  you know, that he had played in like two months. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=418.24s)]
*  I went to crypto that night to watch him play as Utah. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=419.68s)]
*  And he was so tired, like four times up and down the court. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=424.2s)]
*  I'm like, Oh man, I'm like, he's so tired. Like he doesn't even, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=429.32s)]
*  is it, you know, he hasn't been complaining. He's on a new team. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=434.08s)]
*  Like you haven't seen him. And it was kind of funny. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=438.6s)]
*  Like obviously last night's the best that he's looked with the Lakers. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=441.16s)]
*  That first half was incredible. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=443.92s)]
*  The way he was kind of getting into a shot and not like basketball is funny, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=445.28s)]
*  man. You can be this incredible player. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=448.92s)]
*  Here we are talking about somebody who has a chance to be the best player in [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=451.08000000000004s)]
*  the world. And it's like, I'm, I'm new here. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=453.32s)]
*  So I'm just trying to fit in for a little bit. And if you're a coach and you're, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=455.56s)]
*  it's Luca, you're like, don't be trying to fit in to just do what you [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=459.16s)]
*  do. And then we'll figure it out around you. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=464.20000000000005s)]
*  And just because the stats were bad and then they had the weird breaks, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=466.56s)]
*  like all that stuff was so stupid. He was great last night. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=469.72s)]
*  It was funny too, cause he, he made a play and then he cycled out of the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=472.04s)]
*  three point line and was wide open and he didn't get the ball back. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=475.16s)]
*  And it's the first time I've seen him pissed with the Lakers and he put his [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=478.52000000000004s)]
*  hands up like, you idiots, like, what are you, what are you doing? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=482.0s)]
*  And I'm going, this is great. This is, this is like, this, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=485.92s)]
*  that's what you want out of this dude. You want to rest that he didn't get the [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=489.84000000000003s)]
*  ball back. So I'm, I'm shocked. The defensive numbers are that good. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=493.08000000000004s)]
*  The last 15, it's been a big part of this turnaround. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=496.72s)]
*  They finally beat Denver. So I'm not ready to say that they've solved Denver. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=500.36s)]
*  You know, there's just going to be some spacing stuff in the playoffs where if [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=504.08000000000004s)]
*  it's Westbrook or if it's Brown and I think even Michael Porter Jr. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=506.8s)]
*  is like a coin toss game. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=510.76s)]
*  Gordon is a matchup specific guy, but they're going to ignore him. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=513.52s)]
*  Even though he's shooting like over 40% from three, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=516.76s)]
*  they just did a great job of loading up on all this stuff. But look, man, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=519.4s)]
*  you're closing group in a tight playoff game. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=522.76s)]
*  If the three perimeter dudes are LeBron, Luca and Reeves, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=524.6s)]
*  I have a hard time believing that defense is going to be just living on stops [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=528.44s)]
*  though in the play. Right. Right. Yeah. They're probably trying to outscore. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=532.52s)]
*  Yeah. The Luca dialogue was, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=537.56s)]
*  I feel like a lot of the sports dialogue is just getting worse because it's, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=540.24s)]
*  it's, it's just as quick rush to whatever judgment, you know, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=544.24s)]
*  he could have one bad game as first like her game. And it was like, Oh my God, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=547.9599999999999s)]
*  this is why the maps traded them. And it's, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=551.12s)]
*  nobody thinks of the human element of this guy thought he was going to be the [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=553.4399999999999s)]
*  next third of the wits game Dallas. He had no idea the trade was coming. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=556.88s)]
*  They trade him. He's got to move to LA. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=561.7199999999999s)]
*  He's got to figure out where he's going to live. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=563.6s)]
*  He's taking shit about that. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=565.64s)]
*  He's got a drinking problem and that he eats too much and they didn't want to [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=567.44s)]
*  give the max and they're just, you know, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=570.6800000000001s)]
*  laying into him left and right leaking stuff to make them look bad. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=572.88s)]
*  On top of that, he's got to figure out how he fits into this new team. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=576.44s)]
*  He's got to play with LeBron. Who's this guy he grew up watching, right? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=579.24s)]
*  He's got to figure out how he fits in offense, new coaching staff. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=583.24s)]
*  He's not in shape. It's like, Oh, you think this is going to go bad for like a [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=586.36s)]
*  week? Yeah. And he hadn't played. He hadn't played. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=590.1600000000001s)]
*  In basketball. Like Perkins three day Perkins tweeted three days ago. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=593.6s)]
*  It's going to be another two, three weeks before we see the real Luca. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=598.12s)]
*  He has to get in basketball shape, get his legs under. And then last night he tweets, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=600.8000000000001s)]
*  like I said, give Luca time. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=604.5600000000001s)]
*  It's like, yeah, no kidding. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=607.6800000000001s)]
*  We got to give Luca time. Sure. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=611.16s)]
*  To adjust to his new team and get back in shape. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=612.96s)]
*  I'm pretty sure he'll be able to figure this out. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=616.2s)]
*  He's had one of the five best offensive starts to anybody in the history of the [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=618.12s)]
*  NBA in their first seven years. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=621.6s)]
*  I think we're going to be okay with Luca Donchich. I'm not worried, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=623.6s)]
*  but people were worried. It's, I don't know. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=626.64s)]
*  Who was really, like, who did you respect that is what was worried? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=628.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, that's, but some people have platforms who this is, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=632.0s)]
*  this is kind of what you do. You just go nuts, get mad. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=635.6s)]
*  Luca Donchich was terrible. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=639.8000000000001s)]
*  This is why the Mavericks traded him. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=642.9200000000001s)]
*  I would say over 50% of your tweets are about LeBron or Jordan. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=645.6s)]
*  Then you should just be banned from the platform. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=649.08s)]
*  It's fair. We've talked to Elon about it. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=651.96s)]
*  So you've been hanging out with him much lately? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=655.24s)]
*  Haven't talked to him. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=657.0400000000001s)]
*  Lakers have the six best odds on Fandl right now. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=659.12s)]
*  So it's not, it's not a hot take to say, oh, I think they're a title contender. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=661.52s)]
*  I think that's where they are. I think they're in that wild card team. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=665.88s)]
*  I went back and I looked at, uh, I think this, this needs a name. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=668.8000000000001s)]
*  I came up with post all star late bloomer, but I think we could do better. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=673.44s)]
*  I don't know. That sounds great. Thanks. What is it? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=678.84s)]
*  Well, these teams that over the course of the last 30 games at some point, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=681.76s)]
*  got their shit together and became a real contender. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=686.96s)]
*  So the reason I thought of this was because we watched it happen with Dallas [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=688.9200000000001s)]
*  last year. Dallas was 16 and four to finish the season. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=691.48s)]
*  They were fifth net. They just remember they had a big winning streak. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=695.6s)]
*  Then they had a losing streak and then they started winning again. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=700.36s)]
*  And at some point it felt like there might be something there in a real way. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=703.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=707.1600000000001s)]
*  2023 it happened with the Lakers. They were 16 and seven down the stretch. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=707.52s)]
*  Fourth net. They ended up making the Western finals. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=712.48s)]
*  2022 is when the Celtics were they 25 and 25 then went on the run. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=715.56s)]
*  Their last 22 games, they were 17 and five first in that. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=720.68s)]
*  Were they below 502? Like it might've been maybe 24, 25. They made the finals. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=723.6s)]
*  I threw out the two strike, uh, not strike the COVID years. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=728.4s)]
*  And then in 2019 Portland finished the last 25, 19 and six, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=732.16s)]
*  fourth net and they made the Western finals. So this does, there is a team, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=737.28s)]
*  there's a track record of a team we didn't think was in the top three or top [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=741.3199999999999s)]
*  four moves up there. And for me, it's either the Lakers or Golden State. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=746.4s)]
*  And we're taping this right now as a, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=750.4s)]
*  as Golden State's playing and they're beating up on Dallas. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=751.92s)]
*  But those would be my two picks Golden State or the Lakers. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=754.76s)]
*  And I probably lean Lakers cause a, cause a Luca and the talent. Who would you have? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=758.12s)]
*  It feels like the Knicks are on the Lakers line of this though, right? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=763.9599999999999s)]
*  That's fair. But I don't think they, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=767.04s)]
*  would you necessarily say they would be an out of nowhere team? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=770.32s)]
*  I guess it could conceivably happen. I, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=773.48s)]
*  I think they're more likely to have more injuries and weird shit happen than to [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=776.12s)]
*  go on and run. But maybe I'm wrong. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=779.6s)]
*  Okay. But here's, here's something that I like about the Lakers. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=781.4399999999999s)]
*  Cause I think this is always an important thing. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=784.48s)]
*  And because I think guys play more often now, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=786.36s)]
*  cause this could get really misleading sometimes you're looking at like a [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=788.56s)]
*  matchups against the better teams. You're like, okay, who was there? You know, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=791.12s)]
*  like even when I go through those Nick seven games, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=793.8s)]
*  it's basically everybody played in those games for the Knicks. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=796.0s)]
*  I think OG missed one. Yeah. So, you know, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=798.88s)]
*  there's different times where you go head to head and you're, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=801.52s)]
*  you're looking at it and getting ready for the playoffs. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=803.76s)]
*  Like how do they do against each other? You're like, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=805.48s)]
*  all these guys miss these games. But again, like I said, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=806.9200000000001s)]
*  it's been a little bit better. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=809.2s)]
*  The Lakers are one of three teams in the West of a winning record against teams [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=810.84s)]
*  500 or better. So clearly okay. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=813.64s)]
*  Sees 20 and nine, the Rockets are 20 and 15 and the Lakers are 15 and 12. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=815.96s)]
*  And I think that's important. Memphis is under 500, Denver's under 500. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=820.9200000000001s)]
*  The Clippers are under 500, Minnesota's under 500. So again, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=824.4s)]
*  like I said, only three teams, the rest of them are all under 500. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=827.04s)]
*  I think for me on the Lakers part of it is we're totally aligned on the Luca [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=832.04s)]
*  thing. Like give me a break. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=835.76s)]
*  Like this guy at this age with his track record and because he hasn't played in [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=837.24s)]
*  two months, so you're like, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=841.0799999999999s)]
*  if you were watching these early games going, what's wrong? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=843.8s)]
*  So this is what you think it's going to be now. You just think this is, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=846.6s)]
*  right. Cause it's going to be like, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=849.0s)]
*  she's going to be a complete mess. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=850.0s)]
*  Do you know how absurd that is? So it's, we're not even at peak Luca. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=851.5999999999999s)]
*  They're putting together this performance. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=855.5999999999999s)]
*  They have this defensive profile the last month or so, but, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=856.92s)]
*  you know, bracket it out. Four or five, they're playing Houston. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=862.0s)]
*  You're probably picking the Lakers because you trust their offense more than [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=866.04s)]
*  you trust Houston's offense. Right. Okay. Then, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=868.52s)]
*  then guess what's waiting for them on the other line. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=871.68s)]
*  Sadly, I, sadly I did this and it, as you know, I hate the Lakers and this made me [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=873.9599999999999s)]
*  sad. Okay. But how serious by serious? I was like, Oh my God, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=877.8s)]
*  they're going to fucking make the Western finals. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=881.88s)]
*  So they're beating Oklahoma city in a one, four matchup. You're crazy. Oh no, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=884.12s)]
*  I'm just saying there's a scenario with these brackets where if they're not four [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=888.52s)]
*  or five, if they can somehow avoid, okay, see to the Western finals, right. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=891.88s)]
*  And then you think they're going to beat Oklahoma city. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=896.24s)]
*  Well, so they would have to get to two or three. Okay. All right. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=899.68s)]
*  I think it's completely, completely reasonable right now. They're 34 and 21. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=902.5999999999999s)]
*  Memphis is 37 19 and Denver's 37 and 20. I think they have to leapfrog. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=907.2s)]
*  I don't think they'd want to play. Okay. See, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=911.84s)]
*  but I also wouldn't blindly pick okay. See against the, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=913.12s)]
*  against Luca LeBron either. Would you, I mean, I know, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=916.0400000000001s)]
*  I would pick them to win, but I wouldn't be like, I wouldn't be like, Oh, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=920.72s)]
*  lock it in, write it in, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=924.84s)]
*  man in marker that okay. See is a hundred percent winning. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=926.9200000000001s)]
*  I'd be a little nervous. Well, I want to see more of the chat stuff, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=929.8000000000001s)]
*  but defensively the chest stuff has been really good. So, um, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=932.88s)]
*  you know, it's, it's not the same as the look of the thing, but I mean, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=937.0799999999999s)]
*  we're looking at Chet missing three months and then trying to come back. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=939.1999999999999s)]
*  He's not taking a ton of shot. Like, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=941.8399999999999s)]
*  I can't wait to see what that guy looks like and what this team looks like. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=943.0799999999999s)]
*  So there's just, but they still have a massive issue with certain matchups, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=947.1999999999999s)]
*  bigs. And normally I would say, what are you going to do against Jokic? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=951.0s)]
*  Like, do you really think you're going to survive seven games against like [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=954.24s)]
*  having Rui was great last night, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=957.4s)]
*  but let's not lose our minds about who this team is. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=959.76s)]
*  So I still have Denver and okay. See in the Western finals, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=963.08s)]
*  but I think if you start thinking about series by series, game by game, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=967.9200000000001s)]
*  this Lakers team is scary, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=971.76s)]
*  especially with the fact that they're actually well coached, right? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=973.2s)]
*  And there's their matchup team. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=976.4000000000001s)]
*  I think they're a team that could win on the road in a game seven, right? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=978.0s)]
*  How many teams could actually go on the road and win a game seven? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=981.48s)]
*  It's not the longest possible list. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=983.84s)]
*  This is a team that would not be afraid to go on the road. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=986.08s)]
*  I think the Vincent thing is important for them too, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=988.4000000000001s)]
*  because that's a guy who they signed who's been banged up or sucked for a year [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=991.12s)]
*  and a half. And then people forgot that he wasn't good. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=995.52s)]
*  People forgot that he was actually good and valuable in Miami and was in big [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=998.76s)]
*  games for them and kind of knows where to go and what to do. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1002.0s)]
*  He's one of those guys and you need a guy like that in a weird team like this. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1005.12s)]
*  And the fact that Reeves has gone up a level and JJ loves Reeves. I mean, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1008.88s)]
*  that the best thing JJ and LeBron have done have been just pump Reeves up, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1012.68s)]
*  make them really think he's this gifted offensive player. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1018.12s)]
*  And I think he's playing with so much confidence now. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1021.04s)]
*  Like he's how many teams have a third guy who's as good of an offensive player [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1024.08s)]
*  as Reeves is on a long list. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1028.72s)]
*  It isn't a very long list. I mean, Pat Bev really went for it last night. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1032.76s)]
*  I think he tweeted out, they have the best one through four in the NBA. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1035.8s)]
*  And I was like, who's the fourth? It was like Rui. I'm like, all right, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1038.2s)]
*  going, I think you're forgetting about Boston and then OKC with chat. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1041.84s)]
*  I think there's a lot of guys that you could pick from there that would be in [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1046.6799999999998s)]
*  the conversation. But as far as like number three guys with with Reeves, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1049.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, is it is it Derek White? Is it? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1053.6799999999998s)]
*  I was thinking somebody on Cleveland is like Mowgli. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1056.7199999999998s)]
*  It's just a completely different kind of player. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1060.1999999999998s)]
*  Like I'd rather have Mowgli than Reeves, but offensively, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1062.08s)]
*  like initiating your own stuff, it's not even a conversation. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1064.6399999999999s)]
*  Reeves is so good at it. Right. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1066.9199999999998s)]
*  When you're talking about good offensive players, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1068.7199999999998s)]
*  a good litmus test is that guy scored 45 last night. Are you surprised? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1071.96s)]
*  Right. Like Derek White scored 45. I'd be like, what? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1077.6000000000001s)]
*  Did he make like 12 threes? What happened? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1081.7600000000002s)]
*  But Reeves had that game the other day when everybody was hurt. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1083.8400000000001s)]
*  What did he have? Like 38, 40? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1086.0400000000002s)]
*  No, he had 45. He was 45. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1088.2800000000002s)]
*  He had 26. Right. Right. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1090.0800000000002s)]
*  I was shocked. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1091.88s)]
*  Yeah. But the other starters are Dorian Finney Smith, who, by the way, like, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1094.64s)]
*  we hadn't even mentioned yet for the defensive part of what they've done. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1097.5600000000002s)]
*  Right. Huge. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1100.7199999999998s)]
*  Getting D'Angelo Russell away from this basketball team. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1101.52s)]
*  You know, I try to tell you guys, Lakers fans, I know, I get it. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1104.7199999999998s)]
*  You know, he makes a couple threes and points and you guys are super into that. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1107.7199999999998s)]
*  But getting him away from this group has also been a big transition [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1110.9599999999998s)]
*  from who they are right now. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1116.3999999999999s)]
*  And like, I feel bad we didn't even mention Dorian Finney Smith at this point. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1117.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, he made one shot last night and he was a plus 20. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1120.24s)]
*  That trade made me mad. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1124.9599999999998s)]
*  Why? Because you like D'Angelo Russell so much? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1127.8799999999999s)]
*  No, because I like the I wanted the Lakers to not be good. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1130.28s)]
*  I said, fuck, they got Finney Smith. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1133.8799999999999s)]
*  They finished this good. He's an additive player. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1135.24s)]
*  There were some guys around the trade deadline that I was wondering, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1139.08s)]
*  like, I still can't believe the Lakers didn't go after Nick Clifton. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1142.32s)]
*  Was he available? I don't know what. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1146.12s)]
*  And what are the Nets doing? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1149.24s)]
*  I mean, playing their ass off. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1150.6399999999999s)]
*  I know, but they traded to get their picks back for some tanking plan, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1153.8s)]
*  and then they just can't stop beating teams. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1157.6s)]
*  I know. I just don't think Philly was ready for the Keon Johnson, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1159.8s)]
*  Watford, two man game to close. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1162.72s)]
*  They had no scattering report on that. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1164.72s)]
*  Watford was like, I got it. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1166.48s)]
*  I got to get this video to the Scouts. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1168.24s)]
*  I tried to turn that game off like four different times last night. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1170.04s)]
*  Yeah, you couldn't. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1173.48s)]
*  I hate I hate watching the Sixers play basketball. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1174.12s)]
*  Yeah, they are disgusting. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1177.68s)]
*  OK, I can't. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1181.0s)]
*  But I can't turn it off. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1182.12s)]
*  And then I was like, that's close. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1183.72s)]
*  And I'm like, look at Brooklyn. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1185.8s)]
*  Look at this team. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1187.36s)]
*  No, they can't stop. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1188.68s)]
*  It's now they're ahead of them. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1190.4s)]
*  They're ahead of them in the standings and the ease that flipped it. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1191.44s)]
*  In that Philly game, they had a couple of moments where they blew the lead [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1194.0s)]
*  and like, all right, value and effort. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1196.8400000000001s)]
*  And then somebody else would hit a three. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1198.6000000000001s)]
*  And they all said they'd be winning again. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1201.0s)]
*  Whatever Philly is doing to Embiid is one of the weirdest subplots of [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1203.2800000000002s)]
*  not just the year, but the decade. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1206.64s)]
*  I have no idea why he's playing. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1208.5600000000002s)]
*  And he looks miserable. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1210.3200000000002s)]
*  He's falling down, I think, twice as much as he's ever fallen down. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1211.72s)]
*  Looks like he's literally hurt. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1215.68s)]
*  What's his F per 100? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1217.0s)]
*  Do you know? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1218.6399999999999s)]
*  I think this is the highest the last couple of weeks. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1219.36s)]
*  He's just, he had that play when he ran into contest to play in the corner [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1221.56s)]
*  and just kind of went into the third round, he could stop. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1225.8s)]
*  It's pretty, it's pretty brutal. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1229.84s)]
*  So the case for Golden State really quick for it to be the late bloomer [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1231.52s)]
*  is just a combo of Jimmy. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1235.84s)]
*  I don't know what it is about staff. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1239.84s)]
*  It would be the greatest feature somebody wrote, but it just seems like [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1242.52s)]
*  everybody that passes through Steph's life. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1245.24s)]
*  They turn into Gandhi for like the first three weeks, like the way they talk about him. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1247.24s)]
*  It's just like this religious experience to be Steph's teammate. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1251.36s)]
*  And Jimmy is like, so happy. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1254.56s)]
*  Like there was that clip of him diagramming plays in the huddle. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1256.0s)]
*  This is a guy who was just sitting next to the water cooler the last [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1259.44s)]
*  three months of the Miami season. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1263.2s)]
*  And now he's like, Traymond, come here. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1265.28s)]
*  I have an idea for a high screen. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1267.16s)]
*  And he's just so invigorated. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1269.32s)]
*  And I think they're legitimately dangerous looking at their schedule. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1271.0s)]
*  And they're beating Dows today as we're taping, but they got Charlotte, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1274.52s)]
*  Orlando's a mess at Philly. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1277.8s)]
*  Great at Charlotte at Knicks at Nets. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1280.64s)]
*  And then they have a seven game home stand against Detroit, Portland, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1283.48s)]
*  Sacramento, Knicks, Denver, Milwaukee, Toronto. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1286.16s)]
*  Like it's a team that could go on like a 12 to two run and I wouldn't be surprised. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1288.48s)]
*  So that, that would be the other one I'm kind of looking at. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1293.72s)]
*  I guess the thing that the thing to watch is whether Curry can go up a level again or not. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1295.88s)]
*  Cause we haven't seen it this year from him. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1300.32s)]
*  His life looks a lot easier having somebody like Jimmy Butler out there. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1301.8s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1304.56s)]
*  And the shooting numbers would back it up. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1306.24s)]
*  The three point shooting would back it up. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1307.84s)]
*  Even watching the beginning of today's game, even though it wasn't just super [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1309.32s)]
*  aggressive, like having Butler just be somebody else that people are worried [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1313.12s)]
*  about, and of course they ran some other play where it's like Curry's the lead [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1316.8s)]
*  block on the cut. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1320.32s)]
*  So everybody freaks out and then Butler kind of slips a screen and then he's the [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1321.44s)]
*  second cutter behind it and he's wide open in a way that, you know, he's probably [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1325.56s)]
*  like, this must be, I just can't imagine playing basketball for a living and then [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1331.1200000000001s)]
*  getting the chance like, no wonder everybody's in a good mood to like, this [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1334.2s)]
*  is what happens. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1337.52s)]
*  Like when he moves all of this other shit happens. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1338.48s)]
*  And then now my life is like this much easier, although I do have to point out [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1341.24s)]
*  on a couple of broadcasts, like our memories can't be this short. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1346.08s)]
*  Like Butler has a nice game. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1350.44s)]
*  He's super aggressive. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1351.72s)]
*  I mean, he was taking 10 shots a game from Miami. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1352.72s)]
*  It was the lowest field goal. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1354.8s)]
*  Not going to foul at all. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1356.16s)]
*  Yeah, no, he was actually still was like not, he was like, I mean, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1357.48s)]
*  he's, he's one of the most like. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1360.88s)]
*  Hyper free throw rate guys in the league because he pump fakes at the rim and [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1362.92s)]
*  guys just go for it all the time. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1367.0800000000002s)]
*  So like, if you played him in a series, you go, you guys are going to stay down [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1368.6000000000001s)]
*  against him now he's shooting a million free throws, but he's just more [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1372.16s)]
*  aggressive now. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1375.0s)]
*  You can tell he's taken 13 shots a game. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1375.6000000000001s)]
*  Again, the shot count goes down because he's taking so many free throws. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1377.3200000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1380.6000000000001s)]
*  But he, for all the stuff that he talked about in Miami, like they took my joy [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1381.1200000000001s)]
*  from me, like he broke up with a quarterback. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1386.64s)]
*  Uh, you're just going like, we just saw this guy. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1389.3600000000001s)]
*  Destroy his value around the league and he makes a couple of cuts and hit some [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1393.88s)]
*  free throws and it's like, man, golden state, like, you know, everybody was [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1398.8400000000001s)]
*  golden. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1403.52s)]
*  States probably still scared to death of like what the long-term thing could be [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1403.8400000000001s)]
*  here, but in the short term, it's, it's awesome to see, you know, some of these [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1407.2s)]
*  possessions late in games where you could just see step being like, I'm running [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1411.92s)]
*  around, I get the ball, I'm trapped. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1416.84s)]
*  I throw it to somebody else and I don't even want to take some of these shots. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1419.56s)]
*  And then you have people being like, Oh, his, his shooting is dipping. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1423.2s)]
*  It's like, well, no shit. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1426.84s)]
*  So I think his life is going to be a lot easier now. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1428.44s)]
*  I still don't even think they're in the last though. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1430.8s)]
*  Are they used to have them in the Lakers class? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1433.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1435.6799999999998s)]
*  I want to watch it for a couple of weeks because like Butler, he's averaging [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1435.96s)]
*  almost 10 free throws a game for Golden State as we're taping this, they're [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1440.6s)]
*  beating Dallas by 20 and he's already six for six. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1443.36s)]
*  He's plus 24 in the game, but watching the way he's playing with these guys, it, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1447.36s)]
*  it's weird. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1452.1999999999998s)]
*  It reminded me of when Moss got to the Oh seven paths and was just like, so [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1452.6799999999998s)]
*  delighted to be in a real offense with Brady. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1457.0s)]
*  And he was just like skipping around, right. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1459.8s)]
*  And just so happy and, and, uh, had so much space and knew that if he was going [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1463.3999999999999s)]
*  to do whatever the ball was going to be there and Butler watching the space that [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1468.6799999999998s)]
*  he has, but also the connection he has with Draymond, I wasn't prepared for. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1472.76s)]
*  I wish we were watching the game right now. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1476.0s)]
*  Um, but the, the high IQ thing he has with Draymond, I think has been fun to [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1478.0s)]
*  watch where he's posting up and Draymond's at the top and they're playing [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1483.16s)]
*  on this weird two man game, but everybody's so scared of the courage shooting. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1486.44s)]
*  Um, I'm, I'm not counting this team out. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1490.08s)]
*  It reminds me a bit of like when Brian Heideck was cast as the pool guy and Mel [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1495.64s)]
*  Rose place. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1499.52s)]
*  And he was like, look, I'm just, I'm just happy to be here. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1499.88s)]
*  Who was it? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1502.84s)]
*  Brian who? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1503.24s)]
*  Hi, Dick. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1504.24s)]
*  Who's that? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1505.92s)]
*  He's played. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1507.16s)]
*  Brian Heideck. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1507.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1508.76s)]
*  He played the pool guy and Melrose place. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1508.88s)]
*  It just reminds me a lot of that. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1510.52s)]
*  Pool guy and Melrose place. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1512.16s)]
*  I feel like you're making this up. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1513.44s)]
*  Google it. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1516.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1517.76s)]
*  Hi, Dick. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1518.16s)]
*  So is there anybody else you would put on the late bloomer list? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1519.88s)]
*  Late bloomer list. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1523.16s)]
*  Uh, is there any, is there any hope for a healthy Orlando? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1524.2s)]
*  So I had them markdown. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1529.8s)]
*  They've been so, I mean, they were six and 14 in their last 20. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1531.2s)]
*  So there's only a, their offense in their last, their last month, they're the, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1535.16s)]
*  they're the third or fourth worst offense in the NBA and boy, when it's bad on [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1540.16s)]
*  offense for the magic, I'm surprised it was that high that they were only 27. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1543.96s)]
*  So the other three had marked down. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1548.96s)]
*  It's not going to be Detroit, even though there's a lot of good Detroit numbers [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1552.76s)]
*  for the last 20, 25 games. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1555.64s)]
*  How many people do you think right now know what seed Detroit is? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1557.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1561.28s)]
*  Not only is Detroit for the people listening, probably locked into the six [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1561.84s)]
*  seed, it's not like an easy series for the Knicks. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1566.12s)]
*  Like they're going to be favored. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1569.9599999999998s)]
*  I would pick the Knicks, but I don't know if that's like the [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1571.56s)]
*  easiest series possible for them. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1574.28s)]
*  The other two teams I have Minnesota, just cause who knows 31 and 26, but [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1576.32s)]
*  maybe that maybe something is Randall playing. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1580.52s)]
*  I'm out. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1583.8s)]
*  Is that good or bad? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1584.1599999999999s)]
*  If Randall's playing, you're out. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1584.9199999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1586.0s)]
*  And then, uh, the only other way, I mean, Dallas, I guess we have to watch, but the [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1587.04s)]
*  only other one I was thinking was the Clippers. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1591.52s)]
*  If, if there's like a long, healthy Kawhi stretch, a bug Donovich resurgence, um, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1594.1599999999999s)]
*  they're really well coached, like the Lakers and, um, you know, could, could [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1601.12s)]
*  something blossom with them in March? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1606.6799999999998s)]
*  I wouldn't rule it out. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaot2j3Ym6g&t=1609.0s)]
