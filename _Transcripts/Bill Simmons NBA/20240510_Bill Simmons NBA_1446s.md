# The Bigger Problem With the Celtics Game 2 Loss to the Cavs | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k)
*  So the Celtics lost tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=0.0s)]
*  They lost a game two. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1.62s)]
*  It was basically a carbon copy of, of two weeks ago when Miami beat them with one [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=4.1s)]
*  difference. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=9.3s)]
*  Miami had like a historically great three point shooting performance. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=9.84s)]
*  In this case, Cleveland just kicked their ass and probably had the four best [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=14.6s)]
*  guys in the game. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=18.7s)]
*  Not talent wise, like big picture just today. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=20.34s)]
*  They had the four guys who played the best in the game, not just Mitchell [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=23.52s)]
*  Moe, but Laverne and Garland. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=27.66s)]
*  And I think what was depressing to me house, not just that, uh, cousin Sal bet [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=29.900000000000002s)]
*  calves minus nine and a half at 15 to one odds and hit that bet. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=37.5s)]
*  I wish he had told us about that. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=41.18s)]
*  20 to one, whatever it was. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=42.3s)]
*  Um, I felt like the Celtics were probably going to do this. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=45.06s)]
*  I was kind of prepared mentally for the stinker. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=50.18s)]
*  Like my dad told me, yeah, I'm not going tonight. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=53.980000000000004s)]
*  We have to go to this charity thing. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=56.1s)]
*  I'm like, you're skipping a game two of around two playoff games. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=57.22s)]
*  Like, yeah. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=59.74s)]
*  Like in general, there was, I don't want to say a malaise around this series in [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=60.74s)]
*  Boston, but there's this just expectation now that the South's are going to walk [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=65.98s)]
*  to the finals and anytime there's, there's low expectations for the South. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=69.58s)]
*  Oh, we got it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=75.3s)]
*  Oh, it's, it's let's go. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=76.06s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=77.34s)]
*  It seems like they can't resist just taking a shit house. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=78.53999999999999s)]
*  This is what they do. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=82.46000000000001s)]
*  They just take a nice dump on the court. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=83.5s)]
*  I mean, once again, Papa Doc Simmons, your dad is the wise man. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=85.7s)]
*  He knew that, you know, who else took the night off to go to a charity event? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=90.94000000000001s)]
*  The Boston Celtics and the charity was the good people of Cleveland. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=95.62s)]
*  You know, I'm, I'm happy to see it, but look, there's something in this Celtics [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=101.74000000000001s)]
*  DNA situationally since the, the, uh, 2020 bubble season, these Celtics are 18 and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=105.7s)]
*  22 against the spread in games after they win and cover their four and five against [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=113.46000000000001s)]
*  the spread, if they win by 20 or more, they're one and four at home. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=120.1s)]
*  So you said you watched the rear gambling show this morning. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=124.22s)]
*  One of the things we hit on and when we laid out the case for this was, you know, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=127.66s)]
*  we're, we're trying to be creative because talking about this Cleveland Celtics [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=133.1s)]
*  matchup is very difficult. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=137.85999999999999s)]
*  You could go on there and do, you know, correct, um, sequence of wins in the series [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=139.7s)]
*  at 21 to one, we talked up the idea of Boston wins game one, which happened and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=144.9s)]
*  the remaining games were Cleveland wins games too, and then Boston sweeps the rest. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=151.29999999999998s)]
*  So gentlemen sweep with Boston and game two was Boston is 14 and 17 in their last [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=156.14s)]
*  31 home playoff games. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=161.5s)]
*  Usually home court is kind of insane. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=163.73999999999998s)]
*  Um, I think they've played in the last, uh, before the, the, the magic in calves [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=167.14000000000001s)]
*  played in their game seven, the last three or four game sevens were played by [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=173.86s)]
*  the Boston Celtics. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=177.82000000000002s)]
*  It's like they play in a lot of long series and in order to do that, you end up [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=180.10000000000002s)]
*  losing a couple of home games in between. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=184.3s)]
*  I'm actually as, as probably the biggest Celtic skeptic on the call right now. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=187.02s)]
*  I don't think this was the Celtics playing like absolutely horribly. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=191.74s)]
*  I think game two against Miami was a joke, right? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=195.18s)]
*  Like they, they treated those guys like they were not professional NBA players. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=198.78s)]
*  Let them walk into practice threes and you know, they kind of slept, walked [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=203.3s)]
*  through that game. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=208.34s)]
*  I thought this was the calves playing an excellent game. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=208.82s)]
*  Evan was tired at halftime. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=212.62s)]
*  Evan Mobley was making layups. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=214.9s)]
*  Evan Mobley was attempting three pointers. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=217.98000000000002s)]
*  Evan Mobley had a career high playoff high of 19 points by the third quarter. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=220.58s)]
*  These guys were playing over their heads. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=227.5s)]
*  And I think I want to give a little bit of love to what Cleveland did tonight. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=229.9s)]
*  I thought they just played their offense with a sense of purpose that I just [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=233.46s)]
*  hadn't seen them do all playoff long. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=237.58s)]
*  And we can get into some of the different things that they were doing, but man, I [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=240.3s)]
*  thought the calves were pretty damn good. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=243.54s)]
*  It's more so than this was, you know, a classic Celtic stinker. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=245.7s)]
*  They really defended Tatum. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=249.98s)]
*  Streus like does a decent job on Tatum. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=252.66s)]
*  I got to say like, very, Tatum really wanted to get going in this game and he [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=254.89999999999998s)]
*  just couldn't totally do it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=260.46s)]
*  And it seemed like part of, part of Cleveland's strategy was like, Hey, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=261.65999999999997s)]
*  Jalen Brown, feel free. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=265.38s)]
*  And, uh, sometimes that gets dangerous. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=267.62s)]
*  The guards on the Celtics were asleep on both ends. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=270.86s)]
*  It was a very strange drew holiday game. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=273.21999999999997s)]
*  And then that bench, when you take out Porzingis, sometimes it's great. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=275.74s)]
*  When Luke Cornett, when you're up 20, it looks awesome. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=279.58s)]
*  When you're down seven and Luke Cornett's in the game and he can't get a rebound, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=282.74s)]
*  you're like, Oh my God, Luke Cornett's our seventh bid. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=285.82s)]
*  Um, how's the, the thing that worries me, big picture, big, big, big, big picture. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=288.46s)]
*  Uh, other than the lack of killer instinct, uh, the general softness of this [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=295.18s)]
*  team that I actually feared that you were going to bring a nice thing of [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=299.78s)]
*  Charmin, uh, toilet paper and wave it during this, during this pod. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=302.62s)]
*  I was prepared, prepared for it mentally. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=306.86s)]
*  Um, the Tatum piece of this, this was a big storyline this week after game [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=309.58s)]
*  one, cause the stats haven't been that good. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=315.5s)]
*  What do you think dating back to Miami, 2023, the last series they played last [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=319.14s)]
*  year, and then you go Miami series this year and the first two Cleveland games. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=326.1s)]
*  If I told you Jason Tatum took 88 threes in those 14 games, dating back to [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=330.82s)]
*  game one, Miami, 2023, 88 threes. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=336.02s)]
*  How many do you think he made? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=339.98s)]
*  Uh, a quarter of them. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=342.82s)]
*  I mean, my mind's eye has not seen him make a ton of them. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=346.06s)]
*  Is he shooting better than 25% from three? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=349.65999999999997s)]
*  So you're going to say 22? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=351.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=353.74s)]
*  What do you say was 88? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=354.46s)]
*  I was going to be in the thirties, like 33, like 30, like 32, 33 around there. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=356.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=362.62s)]
*  How's it exactly? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=363.34s)]
*  He's 22 for 88 in his last 14 games from threes. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=364.97999999999996s)]
*  He was the 79th best three point shooter this season at 37.9%. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=370.38s)]
*  Last year he was 113th at 35%. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=377.41999999999996s)]
*  In the 2023 playoffs, he was 76th, 32.3%. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=381.86s)]
*  There's this feeling that Jason Tatum is like this lights out awesome three point [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=388.78s)]
*  shooter who can hit all these crazy step backs and there's no statistical [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=393.5s)]
*  evidence for it and I'm tired of watching it. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=397.41999999999996s)]
*  There's no eye evidence either. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=399.86s)]
*  I mean, I, I certainly don't feel that way. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=401.38s)]
*  I, I, I feel like when I watch him compared to, and I voted for Tatum for [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=404.18s)]
*  first team on BA and I think I had, I can't remember if I had him fourth or fifth for MVP. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=408.9s)]
*  When I watched some of these other scores, like SGA, like Luca, like [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=414.9s)]
*  Jokic, how he can get to the spots that he wants unless he's going [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=419.02s)]
*  against the Minnesota pit bulls. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=422.29999999999995s)]
*  Um, like, uh, Brunson, like Donovan Mitchell tonight, like aunt Edwards, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=424.46s)]
*  this whole playoffs, Tatum just seems a level below as a score. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=432.34s)]
*  Like he's, he's not dropping 40 point games left and right. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=436.86s)]
*  It almost feels like, wow. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=440.18s)]
*  It's like, it feels like two years ago against Brooklyn against KD, when he [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=441.18s)]
*  really had that breakout series, I felt better about him offensively that year. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=445.06s)]
*  Then I do now now he's a better, better playmaker. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=448.98s)]
*  I think he's a wiser basketball player. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=453.78000000000003s)]
*  I think he's a better two way player. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=455.62s)]
*  I think he's added to his game and all these different ways, but just [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=456.94s)]
*  fundamentally as like, shit, we're down seven, we need to score some fucking baskets. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=459.42s)]
*  I don't really trust them to get the job done was. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=465.34s)]
*  I don't think he's that kind of guy. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=469.26s)]
*  I think the percentages that you're speaking to is Tatum, you know, he's [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=472.41999999999996s)]
*  doing all the Kobe fan fix stuff before the game, I think sometimes he gets it [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=478.02s)]
*  in his head that his role on his team is to be a run stopper is to, you know, when [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=483.46s)]
*  the other team gets six, seven points in a row, like let me get the ball, force [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=489.5s)]
*  the issue, get to the line, let me get the ball, force the issue, get to a step [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=493.46s)]
*  back and shoot it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=497.29999999999995s)]
*  I think he believes himself. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=498.21999999999997s)]
*  Without the right kind of flow, right? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=500.02s)]
*  It almost seems like he's playing a video game or something versus like some of [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=502.02s)]
*  these other guys I watched, they have a sense of how the game is moving and [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=508.53999999999996s)]
*  flowing, not that he doesn't cause he's shown it in the past sometimes, but this [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=511.85999999999996s)]
*  year I think he's really struggled with it. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=516.5799999999999s)]
*  I just think the idea that everything that he does has to be off the dribble and [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=518.66s)]
*  it can't be, you know, back cutting a guy at the right time or, you know, sprinting [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=523.9s)]
*  down court, pinning a guy underneath the basket, getting the rock and trying to [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=528.9799999999999s)]
*  score that way. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=533.42s)]
*  I think for him, he's got it in his head that everything he has to do needs to be [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=534.14s)]
*  off the dribble when it's quote unquote takeover time, where I just think that [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=538.3s)]
*  the talent is well distributed enough around the roster that he doesn't need to [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=542.78s)]
*  do all of this shot creation, dribble, dribble, dribble, and have that be the [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=547.14s)]
*  way that he attacks, right? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=551.74s)]
*  To me, that's what I see as the limitation. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=553.7s)]
*  He's just like, we've seen it. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=556.34s)]
*  He's just never shown himself to be at the SGA or shoot at the Anthony Edwards [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=557.74s)]
*  level so far in this playoff, like the Luca level, like the prime Kawhi level. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=563.38s)]
*  The, you know, I would say even prime Paul George. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=569.5s)]
*  People forget Paul George once finished third in MVP voting one year. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=572.5400000000001s)]
*  You know, like he's just never shown that he's that, but I don't think he needs to [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=576.46s)]
*  be that on a team this stacked in order for the Celtics to ultimately reach their [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=580.8199999999999s)]
*  goals. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=586.22s)]
*  See, that's where I disagree. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=586.46s)]
*  I actually think they do need him to be that as we get to the final round. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=587.02s)]
*  They play this Minnesota team house. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=591.54s)]
*  I really worry. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=594.42s)]
*  I mean, I talked about this on my last pod. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=596.54s)]
*  I think Minnesota is the best defensive team I've seen in 20 years. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=598.74s)]
*  They're perfectly built to play the Celtics team and we've already seen the [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=602.3s)]
*  matchup and they have guys to throw at both Brown and Tatum. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=605.74s)]
*  They have rim protection and this Celtics team has a tendency of falling into bad [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=609.7s)]
*  shots anyway. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=614.1800000000001s)]
*  And I'm trying not to be pessimistic about a team that won 64 games, but part of [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=615.62s)]
*  me just feels like I don't see this level up that they can do. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=619.66s)]
*  Even today, like one of the things I loved about Tatum was they were really [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=624.54s)]
*  experimenting with him at the foul line and doing like the, the 2011 dirt kind of [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=627.98s)]
*  post-up stuff. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=632.94s)]
*  Even that wasn't really working tonight. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=633.74s)]
*  So, um, I guess my point is this. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=636.14s)]
*  I think he has it in him, but if we're ever going to see it, it's gotta be pretty [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=639.7s)]
*  soon because you're comparing it with some of these other guys we're watching, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=643.94s)]
*  like Brunson, who's just been out of his mind. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=647.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=649.94s)]
*  Uh, just like, you know, 1984 Bernard as a six one point guard. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=650.5s)]
*  And I don't know if Tatum has that in him house. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=655.78s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=657.7s)]
*  You know, what's crazy is I totally agree. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=658.5s)]
*  And this is what every single Celtics fan deep in their heart knows to be true. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=663.1s)]
*  The difference between the Celtics and Denver, for instance, and you know, any [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=668.74s)]
*  other sort of at that upper echelon is just that thing, right? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=674.0200000000001s)]
*  There's two minutes left. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=678.1800000000001s)]
*  You need three baskets to win the basketball game. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=679.7800000000001s)]
*  How are you going to get them? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=682.6600000000001s)]
*  And Tatum figuring into that is a problem. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=683.98s)]
*  It's a challenge. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=688.7s)]
*  It's not something that Celtics fans feel confident about. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=689.62s)]
*  I think that Eme Odoka was going to open that up for him. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=693.82s)]
*  And I think we're now in a holding pattern with him because of what happened, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=699.0200000000001s)]
*  what Eme did that had him, uh, uh, no longer associated with the Boston Celtics. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=704.26s)]
*  I think it, it, it had, it's had an impact on this last sort of level for Tatum to [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=713.02s)]
*  be the guy that I, I mean, you watch it and you live it and it drives you crazy [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=720.34s)]
*  because you're, you're the Celtics fan that you are. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=725.14s)]
*  It drives me crazy watching it. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=727.86s)]
*  What you're having about Celtic fan at the end of games where he stands with the [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=729.54s)]
*  ball, uh, waits for the clock to run out and then does a one legged fall away. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=733.82s)]
*  It's horrendous. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=739.0600000000001s)]
*  We call it the Drew Hanlon drills offense. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=740.38s)]
*  It's like, Jason, just do, do 10 dribbles between your legs and do a step back. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=743.62s)]
*  Do, do a hundred of those. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=748.2199999999999s)]
*  Um, look, the part of the problem with Tatum is he has done it in big situations. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=750.26s)]
*  He has the Milwaukee game in 2022. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=755.9399999999999s)]
*  He has the four threes against Philly in game six. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=758.6999999999999s)]
*  Like the biggest possible stakes where it's like, we're going home unless you [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=762.3s)]
*  play well and he's come through. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=766.42s)]
*  And that's why he gets so much benefit of the doubt, but the results just have [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=768.7s)]
*  not been here in the playoffs so far. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=772.9000000000001s)]
*  He has not had a really good playoff game yet. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=774.34s)]
*  He said every, he said, I think seven games so far, six of the seven. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=776.6600000000001s)]
*  I don't even think he shot higher than 45%. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=781.3800000000001s)]
*  Um, he's getting the line better. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=785.0200000000001s)]
*  He's rebounding. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=786.3000000000001s)]
*  His rebounding was really good in the Miami series and he's better as an [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=786.7800000000001s)]
*  all around player, but was I, there's going to be a point where somebody on this [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=790.1400000000001s)]
*  team, when it gets to nut crunch time, who are we going to, who, who's getting [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=795.3s)]
*  the basket and I would have said, I like the white Porzingis high screen the most. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=799.6999999999999s)]
*  I Porzingis was wearing a green Celtics jacket tonight. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=805.14s)]
*  I don't know whether he looked like he was from South shore, North shore, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=808.62s)]
*  Charlestown, Southie, Worcester, Grafton. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=812.14s)]
*  He looked like a hundred different mass holes that house that I ran into from [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=816.54s)]
*  88 to 91. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=821.14s)]
*  Um, but we need him back because that's the superpower of this team. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=822.86s)]
*  They have, if he's not healthy wise, they have no chance of beating this Minnesota [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=826.94s)]
*  team the way they're playing defense. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=831.86s)]
*  I just don't think they're going to be able to score. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=833.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=835.5s)]
*  I think they'll get to the finals regardless. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=835.9s)]
*  The Knicks, despite their continued winning are dropping players like flies. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=839.26s)]
*  That OG injury is serious. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=845.9s)]
*  I'd be shocked if he's back for the playoffs. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=848.6600000000001s)]
*  If you saw the way that guy limped off and couldn't even walk, remember Zion could [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=850.74s)]
*  actually like walk himself off. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=854.6600000000001s)]
*  OG was cooked. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=856.7s)]
*  So now OG is done. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=857.86s)]
*  Randall's done. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=859.74s)]
*  Mitch is done. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=861.02s)]
*  Bogdanovich is done. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=862.26s)]
*  Like the Knicks are not going to be able to seriously. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=863.46s)]
*  It's almost like that coach is playing everybody too many minutes. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=866.14s)]
*  I'll say this. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=870.7800000000001s)]
*  Ankle injury is one thing. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=872.0600000000001s)]
*  The muscle injury. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=873.4599999999999s)]
*  Most doctors and clinicians will say that that's an overuse injury. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=874.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=881.02s)]
*  Like playing three guys on your team, 40 minutes a game or more playing Josh Hart. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=881.9s)]
*  Josh Hart's at 46.8. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=887.0999999999999s)]
*  I looked it up. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=889.3s)]
*  It's the highest number per game in the history of the playoffs. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=890.42s)]
*  It's the ABA-ABA merger. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=894.02s)]
*  Not one player has ever played eight playoff games and played more minutes of [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=895.86s)]
*  game than Josh Hart since 1976. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=899.86s)]
*  Who do you want to get those minutes instead of Josh Hart though? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=902.26s)]
*  I just don't think it's sustainable to do that. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=905.8199999999999s)]
*  You can't do that. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=907.9s)]
*  It's not, it's not sustainable. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=908.8199999999999s)]
*  You can't do it. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=910.66s)]
*  It's why they're going to lose. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=911.62s)]
*  I think probably to this Pacers team over the course of this thing. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=913.1s)]
*  Wow. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=916.9s)]
*  Not if they get two more officiating crews like game one and two. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=917.18s)]
*  Man, it was like having the early 2000s NBA back. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=922.22s)]
*  I wonder if Ray Allen and Glenn Robinson and Urban Johnson, Sam Cassell were [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=926.58s)]
*  getting PTSD. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=931.3s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=934.14s)]
*  Wow. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=934.8199999999999s)]
*  The NBA offices made the call, huh? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=935.8599999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=940.02s)]
*  That was, I've never seen a travel call get reversed. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=941.54s)]
*  I've been watching basketball my whole life. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=945.62s)]
*  Has that ever happened? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=947.6999999999999s)]
*  What about the barely- [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=949.54s)]
*  No, it wasn't a double dribble though. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=951.6999999999999s)]
*  They got the call right. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=953.8599999999999s)]
*  They reversed it, but they got it right. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=955.06s)]
*  The barely perceptible offensive charge screen, whatever the fuck that was, at [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=957.26s)]
*  the end of game one, that every team does over and over and over again. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=962.9399999999999s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, yeah. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=967.1s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=968.18s)]
*  Offensive foul. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=968.5s)]
*  That could have been called on- [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=969.54s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=970.22s)]
*  We all like the Knicks. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=970.26s)]
*  It's more fun when the Knicks are in the playoffs. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=971.46s)]
*  I support it. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=973.66s)]
*  Me too. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=974.58s)]
*  That could have been called on every single big three Celtics possession in [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=974.98s)]
*  which KG was involved in the screen. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=979.78s)]
*  It could have been like, how about every single Anthony Davis screen this season? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=981.86s)]
*  Where's Dick Pavetta? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=986.26s)]
*  Is Dick Pavetta alive? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=987.14s)]
*  Can he do game five if it's 2-2? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=988.7800000000001s)]
*  Can they just put them in a wheelchair and wheel it back and forth? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=991.86s)]
*  I don't even know if he's alive or not. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=994.58s)]
*  These crews that they've had have been fine. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=996.5400000000001s)]
*  Where's Jake O'Donnell? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=998.6600000000001s)]
*  Can he do one of these games? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=999.82s)]
*  I loved it. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1001.4200000000001s)]
*  I, this is the league we all fell in love with once upon in time. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1001.98s)]
*  Say it's a little WWE theater. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1006.14s)]
*  You got to do it. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1008.0200000000001s)]
*  Hey, there's no chance- [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1012.82s)]
*  All the Celtics fans are loving this. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1014.3s)]
*  There's no chance that, uh, Mowgli's having like a semi awakening, maybe possible. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1015.9799999999999s)]
*  And there's no chance that maybe Mitchell is like, eh, maybe, maybe I'm [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1030.06s)]
*  just going to go on a run here. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1034.86s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1036.4199999999998s)]
*  I'm, I'm a little more scared of this cab series now than I think most Celtics [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1038.46s)]
*  fans, cause I, all the Celtics fans I know are just mad at the Celtics, but I'm [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1042.7s)]
*  more in the sense of, Strew scares me. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1047.42s)]
*  He's killed the Celts a bunch of times. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1049.7s)]
*  Uh, Mowgli tonight looked like the most active skilled big man in the game. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1052.14s)]
*  And Mitchell was the best guy in the court. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1056.9s)]
*  So you have that as a recipe of just multiple guys I'm afraid of, and they [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1059.02s)]
*  have the best guy in the, in the game. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1062.5s)]
*  It's not, not worrisome was. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1065.14s)]
*  It's definitely worrisome in the sense that watching the cabs play tonight, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1068.14s)]
*  particularly in that third quarter where they kind of blew this thing open. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1072.3000000000002s)]
*  I was like, wow, this is like the actual vision of the cabs that people had when [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1076.26s)]
*  they got excited about the Mitchell trade. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1081.7800000000002s)]
*  One, Darius Garland, not hesitating to pull up threes on the pick and roll. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1083.8200000000002s)]
*  I mean, look at that defense too. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1090.38s)]
*  They were hunting him and he was fighting it off. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1091.7800000000002s)]
*  I liked it. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1093.6200000000001s)]
*  Showed a lot of fight, but the, the pull up three game, like if a guy on the ball, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1094.7s)]
*  man, on pick and roll can, is willing to take a bunch of those and can make them [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1099.1s)]
*  with some accuracy that kills what the defense wants to do coverage wise, man. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1103.4199999999998s)]
*  And to have two of those guys, Mitchell was doing it too. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1108.22s)]
*  And then now, you know, this plays where the defense is sort of selling out on the [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1111.3s)]
*  Mitchell and Mowgli pick and roll. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1117.3799999999999s)]
*  And then when he swings it to Garland, he could just quickly attack a scrambling [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1118.82s)]
*  defense like, Oh, okay, this looks like a real NBA offense in ways that, you know, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1122.6599999999999s)]
*  they drop an 83 points, like it's the freaking Knicks in 1999 and the whole game [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1128.5s)]
*  in the first round. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1133.58s)]
*  I'm like, man, this offense is rudimentary and trash, but what they show today, if [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1134.26s)]
*  they could keep this energy going. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1139.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1142.1s)]
*  I think, I think it'll be a little bit tougher, but again, Mowgli, Garland, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1142.42s)]
*  Mitchell, they have to play at their very best, which is basically at all star [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1147.82s)]
*  levels, all of them in order to compete with what the Celtics got going on. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1152.74s)]
*  And I doubt that that'll happen guys. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1157.22s)]
*  House, they scored two, they had two a hundred point games against Orlando. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1159.7s)]
*  They peaked at one oh six and tonight against the Celtics, they scored one 18. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1164.5s)]
*  And it's frustrated me because, and I don't know, I just don't understand. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1170.8600000000001s)]
*  And I don't know if it's a coaching thing or if there's some sort of mental block [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1175.8200000000002s)]
*  with the Celtics, but defense is the key to the Celtics. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1178.98s)]
*  It's all about the defense. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1183.9s)]
*  And then every time they have a bounce back game, which they'll probably bounce [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1185.5s)]
*  back in game three and put a lot of back. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1188.34s)]
*  We want to establish our defensive intensity coming out of the gate. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1189.78s)]
*  We, we let up in game two and we just realized that, you know, we got it. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1193.5s)]
*  Once the defense gets our offense going and it's like, yeah, I [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1197.6999999999998s)]
*  told you this fucking place. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1200.58s)]
*  What is it? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1201.62s)]
*  It's like groundhog day. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1202.3799999999999s)]
*  Like we we've heard the same speech 20 times. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1203.3799999999999s)]
*  Defense gotta get the offense going. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1206.6999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, we know the defense has to get the offense going. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1208.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1211.3s)]
*  So why didn't you know that heading into game two? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1211.78s)]
*  Why was it after the game? [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1214.66s)]
*  This is. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1216.3400000000001s)]
*  I listen, there's some coaches that shouldn't have been fired this year, but [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1218.74s)]
*  if, if Missoula can't get to the finals with the number of breaks that this team [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1221.98s)]
*  got with Jimmy Butler, not playing in round one with Jared Allen getting hurt [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1227.02s)]
*  in round two, and we haven't seen him yet and he was a borderline all star. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1232.3s)]
*  And then game three or round three, it's either the depleted Knicks that are just [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1236.54s)]
*  dropping. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1241.06s)]
*  There's the losing guy every game or the freaking Pacers and they can't make the [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1241.62s)]
*  finals. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1246.18s)]
*  This is one of the biggest chokes in Boston history. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1246.74s)]
*  It is. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1249.26s)]
*  Do you still have any of your mobile stock? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1250.74s)]
*  You still hold on to it? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1253.46s)]
*  I have all of it. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1254.54s)]
*  Zach, Zach, and I text about it at least once a month. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1255.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we have the most. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1259.58s)]
*  We're the biggest shareholders. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1261.74s)]
*  I was wondering as I was watching that game and then you, you won this very show [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1263.62s)]
*  today, Wondered Aloud for our consumption and enjoyment. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1268.3799999999999s)]
*  If like, what if somebody went to Mowgli after game one and like, mother [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1272.6999999999998s)]
*  effort, are you going to let Al Horford and Luke Cornett and Sam [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1278.4199999999998s)]
*  Hauser shut you down? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1283.62s)]
*  Is that, is that like they went up and actually, you know, got the, got into [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1285.1399999999999s)]

*  God damn it. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1293.1399999999999s)]
*  I'm Evan F and Mowgli. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1293.86s)]
*  I've got ambitions and aspirations. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1295.86s)]
*  I'm going to, this is my stage. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1298.34s)]
*  This is my time. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1299.86s)]
*  I mean, they did out physical the Celtics and it made me think of how [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1301.1399999999999s)]
*  vulnerable the Celtics are. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1305.78s)]
*  No question. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1308.5s)]
*  That's right. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1309.34s)]
*  44 to 31 rebounds and 60 to 44 points in the paint. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1312.34s)]
*  That's, that's, that's, you know, putting some ass into it. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1316.9399999999998s)]
*  Well, the thing people forget about Mowgli, he's only 15 years old. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1320.06s)]
*  Nobody talks about that. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1324.4199999999998s)]
*  No, he's actually, he's 22, but he's still a kid. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1325.78s)]
*  I still have all my stock. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1329.18s)]
*  Um, look Celtics fans. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1331.14s)]
*  I don't think you need to panic after this game two loss. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1333.26s)]
*  It's, it's a long series. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1336.98s)]
*  It's a team that the Celtics clearly understand is an inferior opponent. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1339.38s)]
*  They did the same thing the last round. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1344.46s)]
*  They came back and smoked the heat the rest of the way. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1346.3400000000001s)]
*  They took it really seriously. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1349.02s)]
*  That's what the playoffs is all about. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1350.14s)]
*  Let's just, let's just pull out enough to win the old Milton Berle. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1351.78s)]
*  Um, they've only gotten their asses kicked four times this year, just for the record. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1355.7s)]
*  And I'll give you the games. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1360.5800000000002s)]
*  The Quippers came in, beat the shit out of them. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1361.5800000000002s)]
*  They're in the apex of the Quippers era. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1364.66s)]
*  That's the one when they show the highlight tape for people trying to convince them to [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1366.42s)]
*  get season tickets. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1369.54s)]
*  It's like, remember in January, we killed the Celtics. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1370.94s)]
*  The Bucks beat their asses by 33. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1374.02s)]
*  And that was a five games in seven nights. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1377.74s)]
*  They had no legs. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1379.7s)]
*  It happens. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1380.46s)]
*  The Magic kicked their asses, I think in December by 17. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1381.54s)]
*  And then the Cavs tonight and each time the Celtics suck from the three point line, 10 [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1385.18s)]
*  for 40, nine for 35, seven for 29, eight for 35. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1389.18s)]
*  And the problem for them, and this can be a problem as we get to the later rounds is [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1393.02s)]
*  they're not making threes and they fall behind. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1398.22s)]
*  It just turns into this ISO ball fucking disaster and you, and you can see it. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1402.82s)]
*  And it's just like, Oh, all right, you go and I'll stand and I'll watch you. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1408.22s)]
*  No, no, I'll take it. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1412.3s)]
*  You stand and now you watch me. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1413.06s)]
*  And I just can't believe this team won 64 games. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1415.18s)]
*  I've never been more frustrated by a good team my entire fucking life. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1417.7s)]
*  Now we're announcing and announcing the season. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1421.98s)]
*  God damn it. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1426.82s)]
*  Really? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1427.6200000000001s)]
*  Like nicks are dropping every hour. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1428.3400000000001s)]
*  Another Nick gets hurt. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1430.7s)]
*  They can't, they just can't make it three more weeks. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXp599u32k&t=1431.8600000000001s)]
