# Chuck Klosterman on Wemby, Bronny, CFB Playoffs, the Election & The Sopranos  The Bill Simmons Pod
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG35roK_L0Y)
*  Lots of topics to get to, but it's really, it's college football time.
*  College basketball feels like it's back.
*  I've been thinking about you because, you know, you're a giant college sports fan,
*  a giant college sports believer feels like the 12 team college football
*  playoff is working Cooper flags back like college sports is back.
*  Well, sort of.
*  Yes, I guess it kind of is, but you know, uh, uh, this 12 team playoff in
*  football, like it's still keeping things interesting, but in a very
*  different way than it used to be.
*  Like I'm, uh, I'm I guess pleased, but surprised that it has changed
*  things as much as it has.
*  And yet the games themselves are still really good.
*  And I guess that really is the bottom line, but it, it definitely, this is a,
*  this is a weird feeling college football season because of the way things are now.
*  Well, when you say they've changed, what's changed?
*  What's different than it was 10 years ago?
*  Well, okay.
*  So when there was a 14 playoff, and I think this was at times kind of a
*  combative issue for people, but that the whole idea really was to figure out.
*  Who would be the national champion?
*  That was really the only goal.
*  So like last year in Florida state didn't get in, um, it was because, well, we know
*  that they can't win the national championship, so even if their resume sort
*  of looks like they should be in, it doesn't make any sense to put them in the whole
*  idea of this 14 playoff is so we can clearly figure out who the champion is.
*  But with a 12 team playoff, it's a little different.
*  Now it seems like making the playoff is the reward.
*  Like it seems less about just figuring out who wins in the end.
*  Um, and that has changed things quite a bit.
*  It feels different now.
*  Um, like, you know, uh, uh, I like Indiana for example.
*  Okay.
*  So, so Indiana is like, there's 12 or 14 guys who played for James Madison last year.
*  So it's like they moved over, like, you know, like a third of the best players
*  on the team went to that team, the coaches from there as well.
*  And it, nobody is really bothered by that in a way.
*  Like, like not, I'm not even that bothered by it.
*  I guess it's just, it's strange now how it is.
*  And, uh, I, it doesn't seem as though, um, the, like the portal and then I
*  have stuff and all that is, and the playoff and orchestra altogether has
*  sort of completely reinvented this.
*  And yet the interest in it seems relatively the same, which I don't
*  know what that says about fans that, that, that, that they don't seem to
*  really care about the structure of the sport.
*  Maybe it was silly to think that they did.
*  So it's almost like the habits of a college football season.
*  And if you cared about a team or a conference, you were just going to
*  care regardless of what they did.
*  Even if they changed where it's like, oh, we have 20 new guys who were on
*  a different division one team last year.
*  They're just on our team now.
*  It's becomes more like professional sports, which people are used to.
*  It's been, it's, it's almost more than professional sports because professional
*  sports at least has like free agency guidelines and stuff and salary
*  gaps and all these things.
*  I mean, this is, it's, it's in a way more professional than pro sports is.
*  Like I see people say like, ah, you will be on Sanders, you know, go to the NFL
*  now and it's like, this is actually where he should be at college because
*  he really speaks the language of a kid who's like, I want to win, but
*  also what's in it for me.
*  And that seems to be sort of what the nature of this is now that people
*  were just more accepted, accepting, I guess, of this idea that this, you
*  should be able to just like put these teams together instantly.
*  Cause what really has happened, I think, is that, you know, sort of the
*  teams were always like the elite power teams.
*  They've lost their depth.
*  Basically that is what has happened.
*  That these coaches have said like, well, you know, there's three strong
*  safeties at LSU or there's, you know, four offensive tackles at Texas A&M.
*  They can't all play.
*  They all think they're going to play, but some of them aren't.
*  So now we're going to strip those things away.
*  And it really has balanced things out now.
*  Like I don't think the SEC is as dominant as it was in the past.
*  I don't know if the difference between these teams, not just them in the big
*  10, but sort of them and everyone is much less than it was in the past.
*  And that's why I think when they kind of figure out what teams to put in the
*  playoff this year, at least I think this idea of really trying to find the
*  12 best teams sort of in a vacuum.
*  I don't think they should do that this time.
*  I think they should kind of like go, well, okay.
*  And we're going to have this many teams in the playoff and we can't really
*  tell who is superior because this thing has been so shuffled.
*  They almost have to just kind of go like, look at it like professionally.
*  Like it's just who deserves it based on what they did during the year.
*  Well, I'm about as the casual of a college football fan who knows
*  what's going on as it gets.
*  I was invested in that Colorado game last weekend because I knew what the
*  ranking was that I knew if they lost, they were probably out of the playoffs.
*  I just thought it would have been fun in the playoffs.
*  But if it was a year ago, I wouldn't have cared because they just would have been.
*  It's like the question would have been, are they going to play on the December
*  30th bowl or the 31st or will they be on new year's day?
*  And that really would have been all that was at stake.
*  But Saturday actually cared if they won the game or not.
*  So in that respect, it feels like it's worked.
*  I mean, it is.
*  It seems to me like that was a situation where if it was the old system and they
*  went to say they were going to like, you know, uh, Oh, I don't know whatever,
*  whatever bowl they would be going to, if they were going to some lesser bowl,
*  like Travis Hunter wouldn't play and all that stuff.
*  I don't think that's almost seems like a guarantee that would have happened.
*  But that's the reason why they did this, right?
*  I know they wanted to protect against shit like that.
*  Um, but now it's like, I think there was a sense, maybe it's going to be.
*  Four sec teams, four big 10 teams, Notre Dame, probably Boise state, and then one
*  each from the ACC and the big 12, maybe the ACC will have two teams.
*  Maybe it'll be like SMU and Clemson in Miami.
*  And then maybe then it would have to be probably three sec teams then, um, which
*  is, I don't know, maybe that was the goal all along, basically to have it
*  mostly be the big 10 and the SEC.
*  Yeah.
*  Those are the two best conferences, but it, I, I, I'm really interested in this,
*  but it does, it does feel like a different experience watching these games.
*  I, the games are still good.
*  The games themselves, when it's happening, feels exactly the way it always did.
*  Um, but I know in my mind, it's not how it always was like, you know, now it
*  looks like kind of in perpetuity.
*  Now Notre Dame is always just going to have the fifth year quarterback from a
*  school who was kind of academically comparable, like they're just kind of
*  every year that's just going to be the quarterback for Notre Dame is some guy
*  who's in his fifth year who went to school, like wake or Duke or a school that
*  they find acceptable to pull over.
*  So, yeah, I can't even imagine what kind of commitment this is.
*  Academically wink, wink, but also like just like they must start, they
*  have spring practice, right?
*  Then they start actual practice for the season.
*  I'm guessing like late June, someone there like early July, and then they're
*  going all the way through for the next six, six and a half months.
*  Like I, you know, my daughter plays div three, like she plays soccer.
*  They show up in mid August.
*  The season goes, if you make the playoffs or not, it's like, basically
*  ends like first week of November.
*  And even for that, she's like, man, I'm, you know, it's nice that the season's over.
*  I can finally like concentrate on doing schoolwork and go, we can go out again.
*  And that was a two and a half month commitment.
*  These football players, they're going potentially through, you know, at least
*  January, but there's more even playoff games.
*  I just, I, to me, it almost, it almost feels like it should just be a pro sport.
*  Anyway, I don't know how that's a college experience.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, here, like, here's one thing I don't know.
*  Like is, is there anybody who's on say Texas's roster or Ohio States roster,
*  anyone on the roster who's not getting paid?
*  Like our walk-ons even making money in some way.
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, so you tell me the backup quarterback can get paid and not even play.
*  Well, I, I, I'm kind of under the impression that some of these deals are sort of
*  umbrellas for the entire squad that everyone's getting something because that would also,
*  you know, that would, if, if they didn't, that could cause like real inner squad
*  dissension, like it would be a real problem.
*  You know, it's like, it'd be one thing if one guy's getting paid more than another,
*  it'd be another thing if one guy's getting paid a lot and someone else isn't
*  getting paid anything, you know, I gotta believe it's tough.
*  For in football though.
*  Sure.
*  Sure.
*  Yeah.
*  Football is harder.
*  Like basketball, you're talking about basically three to six guys really
*  matter on a basketball team.
*  So then if you get to like the eighth, ninth, tenth man, and they're just being
*  like this guy, AJ DeBansa, that's coming into the, to college next year, who's,
*  you know, really has really looks Kobe T Mac ish and has a chance to be pretty
*  massive.
*  He's just going to make more money than everyone else on his team combined,
*  probably multiplied by six.
*  You know?
*  Well, it's one thing if the money is coming from NIL stuff, like you're in a
*  commercial for like the local sandwich shop or whatever.
*  I think it's another thing when these guys are just sort of like, you know, you
*  see this now that boosters get letters and they're like, we need linebackers.
*  They're like, we need, you know, what are you going to fucking do for us?
*  We need to do this.
*  You know?
*  Um, I think I've said this probably on your podcast before.
*  I've said it many times.
*  What I mean, it, to me, I have a sense of where this is going.
*  Like I might, I'll probably be wrong, but I have a sense of it.
*  It seems to me like we're probably five years away from the sec and the big 10
*  and maybe one other conference breaking away from the NCAA, just, just with
*  an ending that relationship, setting up everything themselves.
*  And then like, if you play for old miss, you can go to school there if you want,
*  but mainly you represent oldness that you just like you play for the team.
*  You're on that roster.
*  You wear those colors.
*  You might be involved in the academic program.
*  They're maybe not, not old miss in particular, all these schools, you know?
*  And I think that they're banking on something, which I think they're right
*  about judging from how sort of this has played out, which is that if you really
*  care about Tennessee or you really care about USC or all these things, you just,
*  it's really just the uniform.
*  That's all you really cared about.
*  Like that that's who you're rooting for.
*  And it doesn't matter if there's absolutely no relationship to college at all.
*  I don't know if over time this will be like a pretty significant detriment
*  because like right now nobody cares because we're just kind of psychologically
*  shifting everything.
*  It's just like, okay, well, we're not going to really think about the
*  relationship these have, these guys have to college.
*  But if, if it turns out that it doesn't matter at all, if it turns out that none
*  of these guys have to even go to the school, they're just basically employees
*  of the school and we're just watching football.
*  It happens to be played by guys between the ages of 18 and 23.
*  And it doesn't mean anything else.
*  There's no regional quality to it.
*  Then it will, then it will basically mean a lot of the things that I thought
*  about college football were fucking wrong.
*  My whole perception, even what I've told myself, what I like about it might be
*  wrong, like if, like it, because all these things that I've been talking about,
*  they certainly don't inform my experience of watching the games.
*  I do not think this when I'm watching it.
*  I only think this when I'm talking about it.
*  And it might be possible that we can just make this split in our mind because
*  obviously there's lots of things about pro sports, but we don't know.
*  And spends time watching the game thing.
*  It's kind of weird that I'm watching this 33 year old guy play baseball.
*  Like this is weird that adults doing this for a living and he's making more than
*  everybody in my town or whatever.
*  We don't think about those things.
*  So maybe we just won't think about it.
*  I mean, because the games themselves are still excellent.
*  I mean, I, uh, every week there's a bunch of games that are interesting.
*  Although I gotta say, I was a little disappointed.
*  I really did for a while think that the army Navy game was going to be two
*  undefeated teams or a team that's undefeated with against a one loss team.
*  That's the only game on that day.
*  I think for people like me, the idea of watching the army Navy game as a de facto
*  playoff game would have been one of the greatest experiences of my college
*  football watching life, not that I have any relationship to the military.
*  It's just that you're so used to watching that game and convincing yourself.
*  Well, it's something like I got to be out.
*  It's raining and the guys are in the stands and it's the only game on like it
*  would have been amazing if that game would have mattered.
*  Um, but I, it was kind of a, it was probably a hopeless stream.
*  I, I, but that's the, uh, that would have been amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  So I found everything you just said.
*  The reason I think college sports is basically invulnerable.
*  There's two sets of fans that I think cannot be killed.
*  The first is like South sun Archie's going to Oregon, right?
*  He's a sophomore.
*  He's coming home for thanks out to the sun parent corner.
*  I said, he's coming home for Thanksgiving on like Wednesday, and then he's going
*  back to school on Friday because they're playing, they have a huge game that
*  weekend he wants to be there.
*  So it's like these students, it's still a factory of, if you go to a school,
*  like that, you're going to get swept.
*  He didn't care about, you know, that team before he went there.
*  And now it's like, he's an Oregon fan for life.
*  So you have this factory of fans that go to those schools that once it's in,
*  they're like, they become Scientologist.
*  It's over there and they're in for good.
*  And then the other side, the other piece that just seems infallible is the, is
*  the alumni and I saw it here in LA when, when Michigan was making its run.
*  Um, and I, I, for some reason knew a bunch of people that went to Michigan
*  and they lost their fucking minds that, that, that this was going and they had
*  groups of friends that they hadn't seen a while or they were going to the game
*  or they were going to watch parties.
*  And that, I think you put those two subsets together and it just, it will
*  never end because you're constantly regenerating new fans that are just
*  going to care for their entire life about their school.
*  Uh, I, I, that's probably true.
*  And I think that with this new influx of new money coming in, I think this
*  change should be made.
*  I don't think anyone who goes to a college who's attending a college should
*  have to pay money to watch that team play.
*  It should be free for any student to go to these games while they're there.
*  And if you graduate from a university, as long as you keep proof of their student
*  ID or whatever, you should be able to attend games of that team for the
*  rest of your life for $10.
*  Right.
*  There's, there's no reason if there's all this money is coming in.
*  Like when I was in college, football games were free.
*  It was a division two school.
*  They're not anymore, but they were then that seemed like a
*  completely reasonable thing.
*  It seems very weird to have someone pay tuition to go to an institution, but you
*  can't see the goddamn football team play unless that makes no sense.
*  And it seems like if you graduate from there and you've paid to go to college
*  there, one of the benefits is for the rest of your life, you should be able to
*  go to these games extremely cheaply.
*  And I think that not like, and now a university would hear this and they would
*  be like, that's insane because like the, they would just think about the amount
*  of revenue that they would lose.
*  But think of the revenue over time.
*  If you were essentially guaranteed that this will always be an essential
*  thing in people's lives.
*  Like, I think it would be good for society.
*  I think it'd be good for sports society.
*  And I think it would be good for the schools over time.
*  You know, you know, what's interesting.
*  We've had 50 years of movies that have talked about how, how stupid this is.
*  Like what, what's the point of student athletes?
*  Why can't we move around the system?
*  Like think about one-on-one with Henry steel, the Robbie Benson movie, but the big
*  one, a fast break when Gabe Kaplan gets to my, you know, one of my favorite sports
*  movies, that's the most politically incorrect sports movie, probably of all time.
*  It is not age well, but Gabe Kaplan gets this job in Vegas and he's just like, I'm
*  just going to bend the system up.
*  I'm going to grab a bunch of people who have no business being in college and we're
*  just going to try to beat the UNLV school that he has to beat.
*  So this is, this is in the seventies where we're thinking about how can we buck
*  the system and it's still going, going, going.
*  Now I wonder, like you mentioned, um, where this is going ultimately, like you said,
*  in five years, these conferences will band together.
*  Just feels like there will be a 32 team league.
*  None of those schools will be considered div one and say anymore.
*  They just won't even be in the NCA.
*  And the new div one will be all the schools that are a little more academically
*  serious, maybe combined with a whole hodgepodge of other schools.
*  They'll have conferences and then div two will be div two and div three will be
*  div three.
*  And that's just how it'll be.
*  I don't know if the academic seriousness will be part of it.
*  I think it will be like, it will be 32 or say 40 teams and it will just be the
*  40 teams who can get into it and they're all going to want it.
*  Like they're all like, you know, it's like, uh, it does, it's not going to, I
*  think that, that the value of this is going to be so incredible.
*  They financial value of this, that, that there isn't somebody, I can't imagine
*  the school it'll be like, like if Cal can get in, they'll do it.
*  Like, you know, it's like Cal, Stanford, Duke.
*  Sure.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, all of these like high end academic schools would still be like, fuck
*  it, we're selling out.
*  We're going to be part of this.
*  Well, I don't know if they would consider it a sellout.
*  I think that they would see it as a value added to the university system.
*  But not like you laid out though, the people weren't even in the school.
*  I mean, that's like a whole other level.
*  I know in real terms it wouldn't, but in the sense that it's like, if somebody
*  wants to go to Stanford or whatever, it's like, uh, they, I think would like the
*  opportunity to also have this other institution attached, this football
*  institution, it'd be the same way.
*  It's like, if, I mean, I feel like you'd be the kind of guy who you would not
*  love moving to a town that wouldn't have a sports franchise, pro sports
*  franchise, you'd feel weird about that.
*  I think you prefer to be places where I like knowing that I can go see NBA stars.
*  Exactly.
*  So I just think that's a non-negotiable for me.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So I think that they're, you know, it's, uh, when sort of kids and their parents
*  are making up the idea of what this college experience should be part of it
*  might involve, you know, seeing the football team on Saturdays or whatever.
*  So I think that those universities will still want that.
*  It's also, it gives them, you know, like such a higher profile.
*  I mean, I, there are some colleges like, you know, like football sort of raised
*  the profile of like Texas tech to a high, like I, no one really ever thought of
*  that school at all before they got, Boise state Boise state's another great example.
*  Yes.
*  You know, that may be even a better one.
*  Um, well, it is funny.
*  Like, like my son's in junior right now.
*  We're just starting to think about college stuff and trying to put it off as
*  long as possible.
*  And when you talk to like counselors and stuff, they all, and we just went with
*  my daughter a little bit too, but they all say the same things.
*  Like what kind of experience does your kid want when they go to college?
*  And one of the things they'll mention is, do you want to go to a big school, a
*  school that has like a good football team and you just get swept up in the
*  whole campus thing and it's, it is a selling point for some people, you know,
*  like you go to the university of Texas.
*  You are now buying into that team for the rest of your life.
*  If you care about sports, right?
*  If I'm a freshman at the university of Texas, I will not care about this
*  team for the rest of my life.
*  And some people, you know, that's, that's, that's a selling point for some people,
*  or it's an unexpected bonus when you get to that school and you're like, oh my
*  God, I'm completely swept up in this.
*  I don't think that's ever going to change.
*  I mean, the meaning of college, I feel like has certainly changed though.
*  The meaning of going to college in general, that there is like just a super
*  high degree of skepticism now among, about the kind of elite colleges with
*  still the understanding that it is this kind of ultimate networking opportunity.
*  So like when you say when kids are like, you're like, they're asking you kids,
*  like what kind of experience do you have?
*  Like it would seem obvious that you would, the answer should be like, well,
*  I'm going to go somewhere where I can sort of pursue the education I want to
*  have a job later, but that's not even kind of, they don't even, they've never
*  used that language.
*  No use the language.
*  It was like, it needs to be sort of like a satisfying experience because
*  everybody has to be happy.
*  If you were like doc, you want to be a doctor or a lawyer, maybe you're
*  thinking about something.
*  Yes.
*  That's the experience.
*  College was so much scarier when we were going to college because you're just
*  being sent off and if you're going like relatively far away or far away from your
*  parents or your family, it's a big deal.
*  Right.
*  We, you, you basically, you could, they could call you and maybe if your phone
*  in your room, they could call and check in.
*  They could write letters.
*  We didn't have the internet right.
*  When we were, we were in college and the way we had it, but it got sent off and
*  it was like, you were kind of on your own really to figure it out.
*  And I look at the way, like even my daughter, like I talk to my daughter all
*  the time, we FaceTime, I would say almost every day.
*  I always know what's going on with her.
*  I can check on my 360 where she is and you know, and she's in a big city.
*  My dad's there.
*  Like, it's just not scary.
*  Like my son, maybe it'll be different if he goes to some place, but I would
*  still feel like I could at least check in and more importantly, he would feel
*  like I at least still have a connection to the people that were in my life.
*  When we were in college, it was like, you were kind of just.
*  Off.
*  Yeah.
*  I know, but I think the difference is that in the past, there was a much greater
*  motive to be by yourself and get away.
*  I mean, this is, you know, I, I saw somebody was talking about, it was
*  just some random person talking about how they had had a conversation with
*  someone who'd been a high school teacher for like 34 years or 40 years or something.
*  And they asked them, what's the biggest difference?
*  And the teacher apparently said, and this is of course anecdotal, but it seems
*  to make a lot of sense to me, says that in the past, the default setting for a
*  high school student was boredom.
*  And now the default setting is anxiety.
*  And I think as a consequence, the idea of going to any college is probably scarier
*  than 30 years ago would have been for a kid from California to go to school in
*  New York, even though it'd be totally across the country, everything would be
*  different.
*  I think that they were probably more interested in decreasing sort of the
*  static boredom of their life.
*  And now it's the opposite where it's like, the hardest thing about my life is life.
*  I'm afraid of life or whatever.
*  Not that all kids are afraid of life.
*  I'm not saying that, but I do think that the amount that kids feel anxiety and
*  are told they need to recognize that feeling makes going to college super
*  complicated.
*  I just, I, I, I would guess you were more ready to go to college than your
*  daughter is despite the fact that you have all this relationship with her
*  ongoing, you know, through technology.
*  I'm just guessing.
*  There's been, there's been really good pieces written about this the last few
*  years about, um, why teenagers and kids have more anxiety than it used to.
*  And one of the theories is that they're more, they're more self aware about the
*  anxiety than maybe we were, you know, in general, kids are more self aware
*  because they're reading more stuff.
*  They're seeing more stuff.
*  Um, they know about therapy.
*  They know about all these different things that we just didn't have any
*  access to, you know, our generation was like, yeah, you're on your own.
*  Figure it out, man.
*  Oh, shit's going down.
*  Hey, maybe you should talk to your roommate about it.
*  Like what, what were we going to do?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I mean, therapeutic language too, has just moved into everyday language.
*  Now, like people using terms like triggering and all these things are like,
*  oh, like all these, all this language is just sort of like, my kids understood
*  that at an age way before they understood things that I thought they could be
*  knowing, you know, that they had just a real sort of like a, um, like sophisticated
*  understanding of these things.
*  And it probably like it, there's no question that kids are in a better
*  position to deal with emotional and mental problems.
*  Now it's just that they seem to have many more emotional and mental problems.
*  So it's like good that they can deal with them because they're just there
*  all the time, you know, or we had, or like our generations and the ones before had
*  way more problems than we realized.
*  Cause we were like dumb and happy.
*  Nobody, we didn't know what was going on.
*  Like that might've really been the case, but how many problems in life, whether
*  you're young or when you're old are actually temporary and not that meaningful
*  and will just dissipate on their own.
*  You know, you say like you were, you didn't know you had these problems.
*  You still don't fucking know you had them, right?
*  Because they just happened.
*  They just moved on.
*  It's like, you know, it's like, it's, it's really, I think, tricky to tell someone
*  going through this complicated phase in their life that they need to be aware of
*  all the complications.
*  I mean, it's like, you have to look for them almost and it's, it's good in some
*  ways.
*  You were going to bring up the election.
*  Let's go.
*  Well, yeah, I'm not going to talk too much about the election itself.
*  As much as I want to talk about this, I really feel that I do not know what's
*  going on in the world now.
*  And I don't mean because of the outcome of this election.
*  I mean, of my understanding of what the world was like, and then the
*  manifestation of the reality.
*  It's like, I, I, I was so like in 2016, you know, it was like kind of a
*  shocking outcome or whatever.
*  This was less shocking.
*  Um, but yet it seemed as though I thought I had a pretty clear or decent
*  understanding of what the situation in the country was.
*  And I was just totally wrong.
*  It's like, I think the country is, you know, we spent so much time, myself
*  included, talking about how polarized the country is.
*  I think in a lot of ways, it's much less polarized than we realized, especially
*  on a whole handful of issues.
*  Um, I suspected, I, I just, I, I, you were one of these people where I, after
*  the, the, the election, I texted people and I just said like, on a scale of one
*  to 10, um, how surprised were you by this election, not how you feel about it,
*  just how surprised you were.
*  And I found kind of a disturbing pattern.
*  Okay.
*  There are some exceptions to this, but for the most part, all the people I
*  texted are, you know, they're intelligent people who follow the news, but some
*  people really follow the news.
*  Some people voraciously follow it.
*  They follow all the narratives.
*  They kind of know anything you referenced.
*  They're like, oh, I already saw that story or whatever.
*  Those people all gave answers like eight, nine, 9.5.
*  It didn't matter what their political leaning was.
*  Like if they were really engaged with media, they were shocked by not just
*  the outcome, but the fact that Trump won all the swing states, that he won the
*  popular vote, all of these things.
*  The people I know, like a lot of my doctors and engineers and stuff who follow the
*  news, but don't give a shit at all about the narrative.
*  Like when they look at the New York times websites, they do not look at the
*  right side of the page.
*  They look at the left side of the page.
*  They all were like one, two, three, like they had, they weren't surprised at all.
*  And I now sort of have the creeping suspicion that engagement with media
*  distances us from reality.
*  That the more information I get, the more information I take in, the less I
*  understand the world.
*  And I don't know what to do about that because that's a real issue if that is
*  true.
*  And that's how it feels for me now.
*  My perception of what the world is, is being so shaped by these things that I'm
*  not even close to what's actually happening.
*  How'd you feel this way?
*  Like how?
*  Well, the Betty markets would agree with you because the Betty markets, I think
*  like five, six days before the election, Kamala was almost even.
*  Yeah.
*  And there was there.
*  Part of the thinking was the abortion women are going to come out for this.
*  People don't realize there's a lot of women even telling who they're married to
*  or people in their lives.
*  They're not coming out.
*  So you'd hear that there was an Iowa poll, right?
*  That it was like, wow, she's doing great in Iowa.
*  So when you're talking about how the media influences stuff, a lot of it is just
*  the media influencing narratives that if you want to believe the narrative and you
*  hear the narrative, you grab onto it.
*  Right.
*  So you see the Iowa poll and you go, well, that's, that's a great sign.
*  She's doing really well in Iowa.
*  Or so it almost feels like stuff was nudging people different ways.
*  But to me, it was like, I thought when, uh, when Elan went on Rogan, I felt like
*  that was the most important part of the election, whether people want to admit it
*  or not, like Rogan coming out and, and saying that he was going to vote for
*  Trump and that he was in on Trump.
*  I think that influenced people.
*  And I don't know if another media figure has that kind of power to, to shift votes.
*  I'm not blaming Rogan one way or the other.
*  I'm just saying there was real momentum that I think some people didn't want to
*  overlook because they were like, Oh, look at the Iowa poll.
*  But I mean, isn't, isn't that a little bit of reverse engineering though?
*  Because I think that's what every election is.
*  Well, oh, well, probably is.
*  Okay.
*  But if that's true, then, then we have a bunch of things to rethink because in a
*  sense, it kind of looked like, well, you know, Oprah Taylor Swift, all these
*  people, they endorse Harris.
*  Nobody cared.
*  Didn't seem to have any influence.
*  So now we're like, well, so it said no impact at all, but you just said that you
*  think that Tim going on Rogan was one of the biggest things like Rogan's endorsement
*  matter.
*  It only because it worked out that way.
*  I don't think any of these endorsements mattered.
*  I now think that basically any Republican candidate would have won this election.
*  I think that, that it, you know, if Nikki Haley would have ran, I think she would
*  have won probably by a very similar margin.
*  I think that there is the sense now that there's all this news going around kind
*  of shifting these stories.
*  Like you say, these stories like, Oh, there's, you know, people are canvassing
*  and, and women are closing the door saying I'm secretly voting for Harris.
*  I'm not my husband.
*  Now it kind of looks like maybe the opposite of this was the case that people
*  were saying they were going to go vote for Harris because they didn't want to be
*  maybe judged or have an issue with their friends who they thought were like it
*  was actually, they were saying the opposite of what this supposed sort of
*  trend, you know, cause hours before the election, you could go on social media
*  and there were people saying things like, what if I told you this isn't going to be
*  close at all thinking that it was going to be a blowout in the other direction.
*  So no one really had any sense of these things.
*  I mean, I, I think that, that the, in this situation, it kind of felt
*  as though there's, there's one thing.
*  There's one thing on the Rogan point that I think people didn't want to see as it
*  was happening, which was that there was young men, basically 18 to 35 that were
*  shifting a certain direction in all these different ways and the Rogan, the
*  Rogan thing was symbolic to it.
*  Um, it just, it just felt like that was the demographic that I think the
*  Democrats were probably counting on that wasn't there in the way they thought.
*  And, and there were just a lot of people ready for a change.
*  I was thinking is the opposite of what happened.
*  Like when we were both in college in 92, right?
*  And it felt like there was this Republican stranglehold on the country.
*  It was 12 straight years, a Republican president and Clinton kind of showed up,
*  you know, a year before the election, he was, became the hot young candidate and
*  people kind of got swept up in it.
*  And just in people our age are around in the college campuses, all of a
*  sudden something shifted and you could say this was legitimate or maybe this is
*  what we wanted to think, but all of a sudden, like Bush, who was heading into
*  his second term, the older Bush, he just felt like this old establishment that
*  people didn't want to part of anymore.
*  And Clinton, who he barely knew anything about was this voice of hope.
*  And it was like, Oh, this guy and, and it just became a groundswell.
*  And it felt, it felt to me that 2024 was a little like that in weird way.
*  It was a little like 2008 too, where it was just people rejecting whatever
*  the infrastructure was.
*  And that was the thing.
*  I don't think the Democrats really fully came to grips with that they had become
*  this infrastructure that a lot of people, especially young people, just didn't
*  want to buy into anymore.
*  Well, you know, 1992 is a particularly strange case though, because, okay, so,
*  so Bush is popular prior to the runner of the election and actually become sort of
*  more popular again, after he loses.
*  It's just this window of time.
*  He became extraordinarily unpopular.
*  The third party candidate of, you know, of parole getting like 19% of the vote
*  that way, cause you know, it's not like, it's not like Clinton got a majority that
*  time because there were three candidates.
*  I mean, that, that was kind of a strange one.
*  I mean, this is a strange one too, you know, but like even the way we're talking
*  about this, you said like, you know, these young men who are sort of moving in a
*  different direction, that was the immediately the, the, the day after the
*  election and two days after it was sort of like, why have these young men become
*  radicalized?
*  And then I was like, well, or is it, is it the opposite?
*  Is it that all of culture has moved away from young men and they have remained
*  static that they have actually changed the least because you know, they're like,
*  I mean, they're sort of, you know, they're, they know 55% of the electorate is women.
*  You know, 60% of people in college now are women.
*  So if you're a college age student and you're a guy in a class and like you, you
*  see someone wearing a t-shirt that says the future is female, maybe you conclude,
*  I guess it is, seems, seems that way to me too.
*  And they maybe just did not, they were like, we're just going to sort of check
*  out in a sense, not, not, not pay attention, but just we're not involved with
*  the way culture is changing and everything else in culture changed sort of.
*  You know, leaving them behind maybe to some degree, and they were kind of like,
*  well, I, you know, I'll, I'll vote for Trump because he doesn't care either or
*  whatever, however they thought.
*  I don't want to say I don't, I don't hear again.
*  I feel very reluctant to even give this opinion because I feel less confident
*  about any of these things now.
*  Like I, I really have a sense that, uh, that what is really happening in people's
*  lives is the chasm between that and the way American life is projected through
*  mass media now is so vast that, uh, the projection is actually giving us
*  confusion over the reality.
*  Do you know what I'm saying?
*  Kind of, it's like, it's like, so like what, what we think the average American
*  is like, or what we think life is like, or what we think people are thinking, or
*  how we think they feel about relationships or how they, all of these things are no
*  longer, um, sort of looking at the reality and saying, well, okay, this is
*  what's going on.
*  It's like, we're sort of building this, like we're constructing this idea of
*  what the country is like, but there is this whole country that is completely
*  untouched and understood.
*  And then when these things happen, when they, when this, when we have a
*  surprising outcome to election, we've got to like go in and then try to re
*  explain it, that we have to like, re figure what, what, what we thought.
*  And, but it's the same thing.
*  It's just guessing again.
*  Like it's not, um,
*  yeah.
*  But you know what it's like?
*  It honestly is like what happens after a sports season abruptly ends.
*  And like, like, let's say the chiefs lose in round two this year.
*  Right.
*  And then people are like, ah, the chiefs, my homes, he's going to win it.
*  It's just, you gotta trust the infrastructure.
*  My homes read, they'll figure it out.
*  And then let's say they lose by 20 in round two and they can't score.
*  And then the next day, what happens?
*  We're like, oh, see the chiefs, they, they, they got old.
*  They got a reboot.
*  They're not explosive enough.
*  They got to really, they got to give my homes more weapons.
*  And then we do the whole next two, three day thing.
*  It would be like, like the Democrats a day after I thought that was a lot like that.
*  There was all this stuff that was just sitting there that anyone could see.
*  And then when they lost, it's like, wow, the Democrats have to figure
*  out how to reinvent themselves.
*  They don't have anybody to, they don't have anybody to inspire.
*  They don't have a message that inspires the country.
*  They don't have politicians that inspire people.
*  They don't have leadership, even the way they handled the Biden thing, the last two
*  years where he was clearly old and they just kept, they kept denying it.
*  And I was like, we need him.
*  We need him.
*  We can beat Trump again with him that did like, just ignore all these other signs.
*  Even John Stewart, when he came back, whatever he did that first daily show.
*  And he did that thing about how old Biden was and a bunch of people got mad at him
*  about it and the same thing happened with Charlemagne a couple of months ago.
*  And it was this elephant in the room that everybody was just like, don't look,
*  don't look, don't look.
*  And now you see him the last couple of months.
*  And it's like, how did anyone not stop this?
*  Where were people, where were, where were the leaders of the party?
*  Why didn't what happened to him just having one term and then trying to find his
*  successor and build a succession plan.
*  And they just didn't do it in time.
*  To me, it was like just bad strategy.
*  And then they, they shoehorn somebody in who had 107 days to try to figure out how
*  to get their message to the country.
*  In retrospect, it seems crazy, but everybody in the moment thought, oh yeah,
*  this will work, this will work, this will work.
*  Well, it's hard to like, who's in a position to tell the president to step down.
*  That's, that's one of the problems there.
*  It's like, even if there's a bunch of people who think two years in, it's like,
*  it would be better to transition to something else.
*  No one's in the, he's the president, right?
*  So no one can really tell him.
*  It would be his wife and his son.
*  And obviously they wanted to keep him as president, but it's, that's the kind of
*  thing where your family steps in and goes, Hey dad, start laying the legacy now to
*  see who replaces you do one year.
*  You can be one term, you can be a hero, but he's just trying to keep his job.
*  Like everybody else is that realistic though, to imagine someone's, I mean,
*  like it would be sort of like, if like, like if, if, you know, what would you do
*  if your son started telling you, you need to retire, would you be like, ah, good
*  point. He's like, no, I know.
*  And he's like, you'd be like, no, I, no, I'm not, I'm not gonna, why would I?
*  It's like, yeah, exactly.
*  I gave a great speech today's ago.
*  Yeah.
*  I had a good podcast with Chuck.
*  It's it seemed as though the shorter runway I thought would help Harris, right?
*  Because it would, you would have all this enthusiasm and it would kind of bleed on
*  through.
*  I think what, one of the things that you mentioned that is a real problem though,
*  and this is the kind of thing that I feel like I was my own fault that I was sort
*  of deluded about, which is that the day after the election, many democratic
*  strategists are like, yeah, we shouldn't have done this thing.
*  I don't know why we were saying that.
*  Like, like they almost immediately admitted that they regretted this.
*  And what was, what is probably true is that people sensed that lack of sincerity
*  during the campaign.
*  It's like, you're like, you don't really believe that.
*  Like you don't really believe these things you're saying, or you're afraid to
*  talk about these things in public.
*  So you're just going to say nothing.
*  And, um, and that, uh, you know,
*  well, but wait a second.
*  And I think that I, that, that a lot of people got a sense of that, but like
*  someone like me who's trying to follow this stuff so closely and sort of know the
*  information, like I'm the one who ends up being the idiot.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But even in the moment, like their whole strategy with Kamala was they were
*  basically treating her like she was a game manager, quarterback in football,
*  right?
*  Like just, just try to get us some first downs.
*  Don't say too much.
*  Let's, let's try to protect, protect certain things with you.
*  Like even the fact that she was doing like some, some carefully playing podcasts
*  or show appearances, right?
*  Where is Trump who's insane, who would just be like, I'll do anything.
*  I'll talk for four hours or whatever platform.
*  I don't care.
*  And she never, she never found that middle ground.
*  I still never felt like I had even after those three and a half months, I never
*  felt like I had a complete sense of everything she stood for and what her
*  message was.
*  And I, I think if the Democrats probably learned anything from the last two years,
*  it's like, people still want to be inspired.
*  Like they still want to feel like I am this person resonates with me in these
*  ways because that was the, that was the attempt though.
*  I mean, up into the last, you know, getting down close to the election, it was
*  sort of like the Republicans have this cynical view, this nihilistic view that
*  America is getting worse.
*  We don't think that we think that, you know, we're, we have, you know,
*  and didn't work.
*  It didn't happen.
*  That's what everybody says during every election.
*  It's like, are you better off four years now than you were four years ago?
*  That's like, we'd been watching that for 30 plus years with the, with both sides.
*  Right?
*  That's what you, when you're the other side, you always try to make it seem
*  like the other side, everybody's worse off.
*  That's, that's the dialogue of an election.
*  I mean, sometimes it's bullshit.
*  Sometimes it's real.
*  Well, is it ever real?
*  Is it really?
*  Maybe it's that.
*  I mean, what does it, like the, you've heard about the chiefs, for example,
*  is that the chiefs go to the playoffs and lose immediately.
*  Uh, if they lose immediately, then of course the response will be like, well,
*  they played all these close games during the year against relatively bad teams.
*  And they barely skipped it out over and over again.
*  They can't do it forever.
*  If they win, of course, then those same wins validate why they won.
*  It was like, they were always ready to just, you know, flip the switch and turn
*  it on, so anything in the past can prove anything, right?
*  Like all these things that people have been saying about Harris, if she had
*  won would still be part of the discourse.
*  It would just be see it was right.
*  It was true.
*  You know?
*  So it's like it, because all of this, these, all this discourse is just, it's, it's.
*  I don't, I hate to say it, but it is like, it's, it is clearly just made up.
*  And what drives me crazy is there's a bunch of people listening to this podcast
*  right now who are hearing me say this.
*  And they're saying like, of course, how did you not know this?
*  We all know this, you know?
*  And like, I, but, but, and, and they're justified in saying that it's like, I, I,
*  I, I just know what's going on.
*  I don't know what's happening.
*  Like, I don't know what's happening in the world.
*  And I just, I have to accept it.
*  I have to accept that.
*  I have no idea what's happening because I don't like, it's just, it's, it's not,
*  and I'm not saying this from this position of outrage.
*  I'm saying this from a position of sort of like, I guess in some ways vulnerability.
*  Like just my recognition that, that, uh, I am now receiving my understanding about
*  life through, through external sources that are not giving me a real depiction of what's happening.
*  Here's the question for me.
*  If the Democrats had actually done this correctly and said, Biden's a one term guy,
*  it's going to be really hard for us to win with Kamala because she was in the Biden
*  administration the whole time.
*  So she can't really criticize the current president.
*  Right?
*  So anybody who has anybody who's like, I don't want to vote for Biden again.
*  I'll take whoever the other side is.
*  Or they like Trump, whatever.
*  And you have this new candidate running who can't also distance themselves from any of
*  the mistakes Biden made, like whatever you think those mistakes were.
*  She's a really unusual situation.
*  Like we haven't had this situation that many times in American history where somebody's
*  had a one term presidency and then somebody in their same party is running who then can't.
*  Basically they're like, I stand for change.
*  It's like, well, you're the vice president for this other guy.
*  Like, so what did he do wrong?
*  And she was never able to really answer that.
*  So if you're the other side, it's like, well, I'm just voting for Biden again.
*  I don't want to vote for Biden again.
*  It's like, they never figured that out.
*  So I wonder like if they just said in 2022, we're going to have Biden's going to leave
*  after one term, we're going to have this, we're going to do this correctly with the
*  convention, with people running, we're going to have new voices and then, you know, people
*  that come in and want to have their version of what they think the country should be.
*  I, that might've worked, but whatever they did, obviously in retrospect, it's like, oh
*  man, that had no chance because she, she got kind of trounced in ways that when you look
*  at some of the polling data, we're pretty surprising.
*  Well, it is, it is weird how, you know, okay.
*  In a sense that the election is proving to be the popular votes can be closer than it
*  initially seemed, but it's a little bit like if, like if Ohio state plays Michigan and
*  it's 28, three at halftime and half the crowd leaves and then the end final score ends up
*  being like 31, 24, it still feels like a blowout.
*  That's kind of how it was.
*  Like the, like, I think some people felt like I'm going to have to stay up all night to
*  see who wins this election.
*  It was over so quickly.
*  It kind of creates the sense that it was a bigger blowout than it was.
*  I just, I guess now I'm pretty skeptical of this idea of you're saying like, well, if
*  they had done this messaging or if they had, or if they had sort of been better at
*  explaining this, it would, I feel maybe people now are just voting for full
*  administrations, one of which they felt was moving left.
*  One of which was moving right.
*  And the sense is we're just gone too far left.
*  We need to tack back the other way.
*  I think that's probably what it was.
*  That's why I say, like, I really doubt it would have made a difference if there had
*  been an open primary, if Trump had been killed and Nikki Ailey or whatever had taken
*  over or, or JD Vance had been the candidate.
*  I think that people were going to vote not about the person because it's now, it's
*  so clear that these things are moving in diametrically different directions.
*  Like there's just no, there's just no overlap between the two policies at all.
*  And the two philosophies at all.
*  There's so, there's only, you know, and to a degree that now it seems like there's
*  probably more shared ideas among the citizenship than there are among the
*  parties, that there's more things that Democrats and Republicans agree on as
*  people than they do as sort of political ideas.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Like, like there might be more things that people who seemingly have different
*  political views actually go like, well, that's too much.
*  Or that's like, I want this, you know, that there may be have more shared values
*  because the parties are incapable of sharing these values.
*  A great example of this is like all this, like RFK food stuff, right?
*  Like this idea it's like we got, we need to take all of these things out of fruit
*  loops or whatever we got to, you know, why does, you know, our food have 19
*  ingredients and like, you know, in England, the same product as for.
*  If someone had said this was going to become an issue in 2024, 10 years ago, we
*  would have assumed it was coming from the left, right?
*  That seems like something the left wants to do.
*  Like when Bloomberg was like, we can't have big pops at, at the movies or whatever.
*  It's like that, that tends to be something that you kind of typically seem from like,
*  like from a progressive side of things and somebody wants, you know, to, to,
*  to make food other, but because it is, it's just arbitrary.
*  It's early now he's into it.
*  So, and he's a Republican now, so now it's a Republican issue.
*  It is, it's just, it's just goofy.
*  Like it doesn't, it has no meaning about there.
*  You can know why I shouldn't say it has no meaning, but you can't connect it to
*  any kind of larger ideology.
*  Like these things are now sort of like we've, we've almost separated ideology
*  from what these policies are supposed to be.
*  So going back to your one to 10 test and the initial premise of this, you were
*  in that you just felt like,
*  why were you so surprised by this?
*  Was it because of the media you're consuming?
*  It does feel like maybe you're consuming,
*  not you, but just anyone,
*  where it felt like abortion was gonna be the biggest
*  deciding theme in the election, right?
*  And then now that we have all the feedback and the polls
*  and what happened, it actually seems like
*  immigration was just as important, right?
*  People's feelings on crime, inflation.
*  There were other things that were just as important
*  and maybe even more important than abortion
*  for what determined the final voting results.
*  But I don't remember reading it in the same way
*  or hearing about it as abortion.
*  Now maybe I'm reading the wrong things,
*  not the wrong things,
*  but maybe I'm just going to a certain sector, I don't know.
*  But then in retrospect, everyone's like, well, of course.
*  And that goes back to, I think, your point of like,
*  you know, sometimes you don't know
*  until the election happens.
*  It's almost like a game.
*  It's like, well, that clearly was more important.
*  It's like, how would we have known that
*  a week before the election?
*  I don't know.
*  Well, yeah, it is.
*  I mean, abortion is one issue,
*  but there was a sense that this was going to be
*  a real critical thing,
*  that there were people who would maybe,
*  I think the assumption was,
*  actually, here's a better way to describe it.
*  It was almost sort of,
*  like we conceded that it was going to be a huge issue.
*  We didn't actually think like,
*  well, it says like,
*  certainly there's going to be a ton of women
*  who are going to vote against Trump
*  because of Roe v. Wade no longer exists or whatever.
*  And it was his decision
*  to put those people in the Supreme Court.
*  I think that that was just an idea
*  that was never really interrogated.
*  I think that the idea of that,
*  that the way we perceive
*  who is in favor or against abortion
*  is probably not accurate,
*  not as accurate as we think.
*  But we sort of think that there's,
*  that if you show a picture of someone,
*  show somebody a picture of somebody,
*  that they can look at that picture and say like,
*  I think this person is going to be in favor of abortion
*  or this looks like a person who might be against it.
*  And it's just not, it's not right.
*  I mean, how, the fact that,
*  Trump did well, did much better with Latino men,
*  that there was almost no,
*  there was nothing prior to the election
*  that was giving us any indication
*  that this would be the case.
*  And then, or like, there was,
*  you know, after the, I'd seen this before,
*  but after the election, many people brought this up.
*  There was this idea that actually a lot of people,
*  a lot of minorities did not like the term Latinx, okay?
*  And then there was, you know, that, you know,
*  so then Harvard, like, I think it was Harvard did a study
*  where it was like, not only do they not like Latinx,
*  they're, you know, less likely to vote for a candidate
*  who uses that term.
*  So it's like somebody of like Mexican heritage
*  hears that term and is repelled by it.
*  And the response seemed to be like, well, that can't be true.
*  And maybe they're racist too, somehow.
*  It made no sense.
*  It was like, they just, like,
*  so the information was there.
*  This study happened before the election.
*  It was, we saw it.
*  But then it's only after the election,
*  they're like, how did they not listen,
*  how did they not respond to this?
*  Well, you could have said that at the time,
*  but at the time, when it was actually happening,
*  when it was still like a dynamic issue,
*  it was just like, well, I don't know, it's probably wrong.
*  It's probably not accurate.
*  But then after the election, it's like, oh, see,
*  it absolutely is, yeah.
*  I mean, the one thing everybody could agree on
*  is that the Democratic Party seemed completely
*  rhetorical in 2024.
*  And that's the biggest reason they lost
*  over any other reason.
*  And that's just it.
*  There's no counter to that.
*  And this has been a thing that's been happening for a while.
*  I feel like the last Democrat
*  that's actually really inspired people was probably Obama.
*  And Obama left office in 2016.
*  I just didn't hear this conversation though in August.
*  I did not hear people saying that.
*  So how can something be so obviously true now
*  that we weren't saying 21 days ago?
*  Because here's the reason.
*  Because people were like, well, look,
*  we can't let Trump win.
*  So whatever we have on this other side,
*  that's just who has to win.
*  Trump can't win.
*  That was basically became the message of the party.
*  They didn't actually have a message.
*  And I don't even know what their message
*  they're trying to do, but it's too bad.
*  And even watching Biden,
*  Biden hit the Celtics in the White House last week.
*  It was like a rough watch, man.
*  I can't believe that they were trying to make it seem like
*  even as recently as June that he had a second term in him.
*  It's crazy.
*  So I was talking to Van and Big Wise on my pod
*  about NBA superstardom.
*  And the concept of Kobe and Curry and LeBron
*  being the last three American stars that we've had.
*  And how they, each situation was a little bit
*  of unicornish, right?
*  If Kobe, the son of an NBA player who ends up
*  on the Lakers playing with Shaq,
*  he's in the finals by the time he's in year four,
*  then has a bunch of, they win three straight titles.
*  He has the trial, like the whole arc of it.
*  Then he has to come back and keep reinventing himself.
*  The whole arc of it can't be replicated.
*  Curry comes in, son of an NBA player,
*  completely changes how basketball is played
*  and kids gravitate to him like he's a podpiper.
*  And he's playing in a big market in San Francisco.
*  Can't be replicated.
*  LeBron comes in as the most hyped non-center we've ever had,
*  lives up to it and then some, then has the decision
*  which pushes him to another level,
*  wins titles, keeps going and going and going.
*  Now he's in year 22 and still relevant.
*  Can't be replicated.
*  And people are asking like, well, where's the next NBA star?
*  What happens when Curry and LeBron leave?
*  And I don't know if there's another unicorn coming,
*  which is what I said to Van and Waz,
*  but I need your take.
*  Like, can we have a giant American NBA superstar again?
*  Or has the culture just changed against it?
*  What needs to happen?
*  Well, okay, you kind of went through all these guys
*  and with every case, you were sort of like,
*  this sort of unique scenario happened, okay?
*  Unique to them, you know?
*  I mean, that will happen again, right?
*  There will be unique situations that we can't foresee
*  that somebody will achieve sort of a level of fame
*  that will be unlike any other superstar from the past.
*  I would argue it's happening right now
*  with Anthony Edwards.
*  And yet, I don't know why it feels like
*  he doesn't have the same chance
*  that those other three guys had.
*  But I would argue that, like,
*  I love watching Anthony Edwards.
*  I watched the Celtics-Timberwolves game
*  and I was just like, fucking love this guy.
*  I love the way he plays.
*  I love how hard he plays.
*  He's so charismatic.
*  We always talk about how NBA players hold back
*  or they're not authentic.
*  This guy's completely authentic at all times.
*  He's amazing to watch.
*  He really gives a shit.
*  He's an awesome two-way player.
*  And yet, I don't think he'll ever be as famous as Kobe was.
*  I don't think so, no.
*  I think that's unlikely.
*  I also don't think he's going to be as good as Kobe
*  relative to his peers.
*  So that's part of it as well.
*  He's on the same track for Kobe at least.
*  Like stats, ability, stuff he's done already at his age.
*  Like, he's parallel at worst.
*  So you think that there is a high likelihood
*  that he will retire among the 15 best players of all time?
*  I don't, but he's also not playing with Shaq
*  for the first seven years of his career.
*  Which goes back to, the question I was thinking for you
*  is like, if Kobe...
*  So these are two separate questions
*  that are the same question.
*  Kobe just gets drafted by Charlotte
*  and plays at Charlotte for his entire career.
*  Is he Kobe?
*  I don't think he is.
*  No way.
*  If Kobe's just Italian, never lived in America,
*  and his name's Kobe Bryantini,
*  and he's an Italian, phone through comes,
*  he has an accent and ends up on the Lakers,
*  but he's Kobe Bryantini, the Italian.
*  Is it the same?
*  I don't think so.
*  That's a little tougher one.
*  I mean, so like, so, okay, by this logic,
*  if Luka was from Nebraska.
*  Right.
*  We talked about this with Waza Ben,
*  if Luka's name was Luke Jenkins.
*  Okay, okay, would he...
*  White guy.
*  He's basically the Matt Novart character in Blue Chips.
*  He's like, grew up, he had Tractor,
*  is that a Tractor?
*  And it's just, because there's this whole other piece
*  that a lot of the best guys in the league now are foreign,
*  and we haven't seen a foreign player yet
*  resonate with American fans the way that,
*  those three guys that I mentioned plus MJ,
*  plus Bird and Magic,
*  no foreign player has been able to even touch
*  those six guys.
*  Well, we did a podcast before, I think,
*  Wemby's rookie year, or maybe during Wemby's rookie year.
*  And I said that I thought he was going to have
*  a good rookie year and a good second year,
*  and he was going to have sort of a statistical explosion
*  his third year.
*  You're on pace.
*  Oh, yes, because I feel like this year,
*  it's probably gonna be very comparable to his rookie year,
*  a little better, he's getting a little more time.
*  But I think he could have like a,
*  I don't know, I wouldn't say a wilt-like year,
*  but he could have some real,
*  I think he's gonna have a couple seasons where he is,
*  if he's healthy, he'll have some sort of insane numbers.
*  He'll be an interesting test case, I think.
*  Like if,
*  I,
*  but like with,
*  Luca would be more, I think, popular among Americans
*  if he was an American player,
*  but I also think that there's also sort of a certain cache
*  to him because he's a foreign player.
*  I mean, it's really hard to deduce of like,
*  what is the prejudice, level of prejudice
*  against European players?
*  Because it's a different kind of prejudice, right?
*  It's a different kind of prejudice than sort of a solely
*  sort of race-based or faith-based sort of prejudice.
*  Like when someone,
*  if someone doesn't like a foreign player
*  or doesn't like them as much as they would
*  if they were American.
*  Or they're apathetic.
*  Yeah.
*  The apathy is the number one thing.
*  I do think sometimes it's just the sort of,
*  the ease in saying the name and sort of like the,
*  the understanding of what this person is like.
*  I mean, certainly, you know,
*  the joker should be as famous as any athlete
*  in the country, right?
*  Wouldn't, shouldn't he be?
*  I mean, it's like,
*  like in terms of what he has accomplished
*  and the way he plays and all of these things.
*  And he is a popular player.
*  You know, like you mentioned Cooper flag or whatever.
*  So how good does Cooper flag have to be
*  to sort of become the biggest player in the league?
*  Are you sort of suggesting that
*  Cooper flag could be a tier below Anthony Edwards
*  and be more famous?
*  Does he need to be the best player in the league?
*  Well, they're both American.
*  Yeah, they're both American.
*  Yes.
*  No, I would say the comparison to me would be
*  Cooper flag versus like Tim Duncan.
*  Okay.
*  So, and Tim Duncan, he's from St. Croix,
*  but is somebody that I don't think resonated
*  and probably in the way that he should have.
*  And even now I find myself trying to defend him
*  all the time.
*  He won five titles, two straight MVPs.
*  I think he's-
*  Who are you defending him against?
*  Who's criticizing him?
*  I think as the years pass,
*  especially like if it's a basketball reference
*  slash TikTok culture of Tim Duncan,
*  like he's just not going to do as well
*  because his game and the stuff that he was good at
*  was so day to day week to week.
*  He didn't care about stats.
*  He affected his team in all of these amazing ways
*  that I just think as the years pass,
*  people are going to start chipping away at it
*  the same way that Karl Malone's going to gain steam
*  as the years pass.
*  You'd be like, oh my God,
*  look at those Karl Malone stats.
*  With the Cooper flag piece.
*  I don't feel like that's happening though.
*  I don't feel like Karl Malone status
*  is being elevated over time.
*  Well, he has other issues, but no, I'm just saying
*  if you're basing it on stats and you're in 2075,
*  the year 2075 just studying basketball players,
*  you'd be like, oh, Karl Malone,
*  if he just won a couple more titles,
*  he's right there with Tim Duncan.
*  And it's just like, that wasn't the case.
*  But with Cooper flag, I think you'd have to win titles.
*  You'd have to be this Duncan KG type player,
*  which I think he is.
*  And then it depends on the situation.
*  Would people root for that in a different way
*  than they would root for it if he was
*  from a European country or he was like from Slovenia?
*  I do think people would have more of a connection to it.
*  It's the sad reality of how NBA stars are treated.
*  He's from Maine.
*  He grew up idolized in the 86 Celtics.
*  That shit's going to play a little differently.
*  Wemby is the interesting test case for me though,
*  because it seems like if he doesn't get hurt,
*  he is going to be the dominant player
*  in the league at some point.
*  And what is that going to look like?
*  Is that going to sell shoes?
*  Is he going to have the most commercials?
*  I'm just dubious because we've never seen it before.
*  I said to Waz in band, Hakim, who is amazing,
*  who was one of the 12 or 13 best players ever,
*  who is super fun to watch, who was great to watch in person,
*  who beat Shaq in an NBA finals,
*  who won two titles without really an all NBA player
*  in his team and had one of the best three year stretches
*  in the history of the league.
*  It's just not as famous as Shaq is and wasn't as beloved.
*  And I think if you ask most people
*  who had a better career, Hakim or Shaq,
*  just about everybody would say Shaq.
*  Well, it's possible that right now that might happen.
*  Yeah, right now they would say Shaq.
*  I don't know if they will in 10 or 20 years though,
*  because it's like you say, like,
*  and you mentioned like TikTok or whatever,
*  like in the TikTok world, Tim Duncan is, you know,
*  not below because a collection of Tim Duncan highlights
*  is not, you know, an amazing thing to watch.
*  It doesn't work the way you say like, you know,
*  there's a ton of players we've mentioned before.
*  Vince Carter.
*  But is that really a real reflection
*  of how these things are going to be remembered?
*  See, I think it is.
*  I think that's the part you're missing.
*  I think for people under 25 who I'm just shocked,
*  I see it with my son.
*  I'm shocked by how much information he gets
*  from these YouTube videos and TikTok stuff
*  that makes him think he understands the history of basketball.
*  And that's the part that scares me.
*  But look what you just said.
*  Makes him think he understands the history of basketball
*  in the same way I'm guessing when you were his age,
*  when you were his age,
*  you believed you had a full understanding of basketball
*  and the history of basketball that now-
*  Well, our generation had to work harder
*  at understanding basketball though.
*  We had to read all of these different books.
*  We read Sports Illustrated every week.
*  We were watching whatever games we could watch on TV.
*  They weren't like these digestible,
*  20 second, 30 second, 60 second videos.
*  I sound like an old guy complaining about it.
*  I'm not.
*  I'm just saying it's way easier to shift perception now
*  than it was in 1989.
*  Well, it is, yes.
*  Is it possible that if TikTok had existed
*  when I was younger,
*  would I think Connie Hawkins
*  is one of the five best players of all time?
*  Why not?
*  Yeah, would I think World Be Free is better than he is?
*  I guess maybe.
*  I mean, this is like-
*  World Be Free is a good example.
*  It would have been a whole World Be Free is a problem.
*  It would have been like LaMelo ball right now.
*  LaMelo is averaging 30 points a game.
*  And if you're just dissecting him on the internet,
*  he seems like he's one of the seven best guys in the league.
*  I've read this book a bunch of years ago.
*  The book is called Black Swan.
*  The guy who wrote the book,
*  he gets kind of a punching bag now for some reason,
*  but this book had some interesting ideas in it.
*  One of the things he mentions is this,
*  kind of as a side sort of,
*  is something that I've always kind of kept in my mind,
*  which it was this test that one time was done on people
*  where they would say like,
*  take a picture of a fire hydrant next to like a Volvo.
*  And then they would make the photo extremely blurry.
*  And then they would have two groups of people
*  look at that image slowly become sharper.
*  They would take away the fuzziness.
*  Some people were given 25 steps.
*  Like there'd be 25 steps along the way
*  from the most fuzzy to the least fuzzy.
*  And some people would be given 10.
*  I'm just kind of making these figures up.
*  But one is it's like,
*  it's 25 incremental steps against 10 incremental steps.
*  And they did find that the people
*  who had 25 incremental steps, more information,
*  figured out it was a fire hydrant and a Volvo later.
*  Because every sort of wrong image
*  allowed them to sort of make up what it could be.
*  Maybe it's a Dalmatian.
*  Oh, no, maybe it's a Rubik's cube or whatever.
*  Whereas the people getting only the 10 incremental changes
*  were better because they were like,
*  they didn't have the ability to sort of project
*  other ideas onto what it was.
*  What you're saying is kind of the same thing.
*  That you're saying that because of TikTok in a way,
*  people are getting all these sort of random images of things.
*  It allows them to have sort of obscure,
*  arcane, inaccurate thoughts.
*  They're seeing more stuff.
*  That could be.
*  That's not too crazy.
*  I think the perception right now,
*  if you ask an entire generation of people under 30,
*  who is better, Kobe Bryant or Tim Duncan?
*  Based on the last 10 years of how those careers
*  and highlights and everything else has been pushed out,
*  I think 90% of the people would say Kobe Bryant.
*  If you ask anyone under 30, who is better,
*  Kobe Bryant or Tim Duncan?
*  I feel like Kobe would get 90%
*  of whatever this imaginary vote is.
*  Okay, but this is a mistake that you make
*  and a mistake I make too sometimes.
*  But one thing is these ideas,
*  you ask the random person under 30.
*  I'm saying every single person under 30.
*  Exactly, exactly.
*  That's the mistake.
*  Yep.
*  The idea that we can have an understanding of these things
*  by casting the widest possible net
*  so any random person's ideas
*  have to be sort of taken seriously.
*  Actually how it works.
*  Say with music, for example,
*  when we think about which acts from the past
*  are significant, it can't be that you ask every single person
*  who had a bigger impact on music.
*  If you ask Fleetwood Mac and the Velvet Underground.
*  Well, it's like more people have obviously heard
*  of Fleetwood Mac, they're gonna give that answer.
*  But if you keep moving over time,
*  say we get like 50 years down the line
*  where the commercial significance of something
*  will matter less and sort of what the sort of very small
*  sliver of people who really care about these things say,
*  then the answer maybe flips.
*  I mean, you talk about, you say like,
*  you ask some random 27 year old,
*  like who's better between Kobe Bryant and Tim Duncan?
*  They probably do say, Kobe Bryant,
*  but you can ask that same person a lot of binary questions
*  and they'll give an answer that would be rejected
*  by an expert.
*  But you will still be talking about this in 20 years
*  unless your son convinces you to retire.
*  But you'll still be talking about basketball
*  from the early 2000s, okay?
*  Most people will not.
*  And those end up becoming what the true answers are.
*  Early 2000s, how about the 80s?
*  I'll still be talking about all the eras.
*  Well, sure, sure.
*  But what I'm saying with any of these,
*  I thought I was using, we were using Kobe and Tim Duncan.
*  Yeah, yeah, no, no.
*  But what I'm saying is like, it is,
*  you see this all the time.
*  Remember, okay, there was a time when like Kanye West
*  made a song with Paul McCartney.
*  And it was really popular during this.
*  We don't see this much anymore, which is good,
*  but there used to always be a situation
*  like that would happen.
*  And you'd see a story where somebody would just link
*  to a bunch of tweets about,
*  look at all these people
*  who don't know who Paul McCartney is.
*  Like, you know, all these people going like,
*  who's this person Kanye West is making a record with?
*  And we look at that and we're like,
*  oh man, young people are idiots.
*  Well, actually, no, those people are idiots.
*  There's always some idiots, right?
*  There's always some people who don't know about the past
*  and are gonna be very vocal and almost happy about it.
*  But those opinions don't stick.
*  I mean, like those opinions fall by the wayside.
*  So like, you know, it's like if, you know,
*  you sometimes will like, have mentioned,
*  I think Jason Williams sometimes is an example of a guy.
*  Oh, white chocolate.
*  White chocolate was a problem.
*  That drives you crazy, kind of.
*  And he's like, you know,
*  and he's a great example of this
*  because his highlights are amazing,
*  but his statistics in his performance makes him like,
*  you know, I mean, he was the second best player
*  on his high school team.
*  You know who his best player was?
*  How about this?
*  Randy Moss.
*  But regardless, what I'm saying is that sort of,
*  that interest in Jason Williams,
*  there's no criticism of him either,
*  but it's like, that's not gonna sustain
*  a reputation over time.
*  Like that's going to appeal to the most casual person.
*  Well, unfortunately, that's a lot of sports fans.
*  What's interesting to me is when we all decide something,
*  when we're there in the moment and it becomes like,
*  look, we're locking this down, just put this in the vault.
*  We're done with this.
*  And then as the years pass, it starts to shift.
*  Like I look at Joe Montana this way.
*  And now Brady, I think Brady took the GOAT title
*  from Joe Montana, there's no question.
*  But I think as the years pass,
*  now we've hit a point where if you showed somebody
*  two minutes of Steve Young highlights
*  and two minutes of Joe Montana highlights,
*  they'd be stunned that Steve Young didn't take
*  Joe Montana's job like immediately
*  when he was on the 49ers.
*  It was like, well, we were there.
*  We were watching all the football games.
*  Joe Montana was the best.
*  If your life depended on a game, you would just pick him.
*  I don't care what the stats are.
*  He was absolutely the best.
*  He was the best at crunch time.
*  He was the best at everything.
*  Him versus Marino versus Elway.
*  Joe Montana was the answer.
*  And then the years passed and it's like,
*  ah, Joe Montana, well, he did have Jerry Rice.
*  Well, he did have Bill Walsh.
*  Well, they did have some luck.
*  And you could start picking it apart,
*  which I think it's weird to me as I get older
*  that certain things that we just thought were irrefutable
*  are now up in the air.
*  It's like, Joe Montana to me was like unassailable.
*  Somebody's gonna have to take the GOAT title from him.
*  The same way I feel about Jordan.
*  Well, it would have been interesting
*  if Montana had not went to the Chiefs.
*  Not that he played poorly with the Chiefs,
*  but he went over there.
*  And if he had just ended his career
*  after say the fourth Super Bowl or whatever,
*  I think it would be different.
*  Because not only then did the Niners win with Young
*  and that Jerry Rice basically had similar statistics
*  with both guys.
*  It was almost like they did seem a little bit
*  like irreplaceable in that regard.
*  And then there was a whole glut of guys
*  who came after Montana in the 90s,
*  who had kind of huge years
*  and didn't seem that far below him.
*  Like the farve types, yeah.
*  Farve, sort of the end of sort of looking
*  at Marino's career and the statistical achievement.
*  The fact that Elway still played pretty late
*  into the 90s effectively.
*  Steve Young did have a good period there.
*  Jim Kelly had some great-
*  Jim Kelly had a good run.
*  Fun to bet against.
*  Yeah, and it wasn't as though,
*  when Jordan left the league and there did feel like,
*  well now there's this huge hole and this huge gap.
*  And the best guy now is not even,
*  if Jordan comes while he's playing baseball,
*  he's the assumption he's the best player is.
*  Well, let me ask you this.
*  And he comes back and says,
*  why do we spend so much time,
*  football is way more popular than the NBA.
*  Like way more, it's not even close.
*  Yet we spend way more time talking about legacies
*  and all-time grades being measured against each other
*  and how the current guy measures against some guy
*  from 30, 40 years ago than we do with football.
*  And it almost makes me wonder,
*  do we just not understand football?
*  Because the only things I will believe
*  till the day I die or until somebody passes them,
*  Jerry Rice is the best receiver I've ever seen.
*  Lawrence Taylor is the best defensive player I've ever seen.
*  And those are like the bars to me.
*  And I don't even want,
*  I wouldn't even bother like doing evidence
*  because it's a little harder to do it in football.
*  Montana was the QB for me and then Brady took it.
*  But I just feel like that's always gonna be the case for me.
*  And I don't think people would challenge it
*  in the same way they would with the NBA, right?
*  The NBA, and I don't know why that is.
*  Well, okay, I have a theory on this, I guess.
*  Again, last podcast I did this.
*  So we're working on this book
*  and this is something that's gonna be a part of this book
*  and I don't wanna talk too much about it.
*  Okay.
*  Football has-
*  Wait, did we do this last podcast?
*  Well, no, I was talking about
*  why football works so well on television.
*  These are all part of the same book.
*  This book is kind of the socio-cultural meaning of football
*  in a very broad sense.
*  One of the things that I write about in this book
*  is that this kind of paradoxical advantage
*  that I think football has.
*  Because I'm gonna say something
*  that's gonna sound real bad and real negative,
*  but actually works to football's benefit.
*  Which is that football is a dehumanizing enterprise.
*  Football dehumanizes the people on the field.
*  We can't really see their faces.
*  Their colors are, the colors of a football uniform
*  are more than any other sport.
*  It's very easy to watch a college football game
*  if Tulane is playing LSU or something.
*  Just the matchup of those colors
*  is enough to sustain it aesthetically.
*  We don't even have to think of the guys.
*  It's a completely controlled sport with such a hierarchy.
*  The play's coming from a guy in the box,
*  down to the coach on the sideline,
*  who's then putting it into the quarterback,
*  who's then relaying it.
*  Nothing is happening by accident.
*  There is like that famous, you know,
*  the famous Dave Hickey essay,
*  The Heresy of Zone Defense.
*  Are you familiar with this?
*  Okay.
*  Basically this art critic wrote this great essay
*  about basketball and his whole thing was that all the rules
*  and all the nature of basketball
*  should be pushed toward freedom.
*  Because that's what we think we want from sports, right?
*  We think we wanna see the players be free,
*  have unlimited agency.
*  And in a conversation, that's how it works.
*  So when we're talking about superstars,
*  it's great to talk about the NBA because we see these guys.
*  We really know these guys, we feel like they do.
*  But football success comes from the fact
*  that it's not dependent on the people.
*  It is dependent on the actual game.
*  What people love about football is not the things around it,
*  but what is literally happening
*  between the sidelines and the end zones.
*  What's going on there?
*  That is what matters.
*  So basketball is the exact opposite, right?
*  What people seem to care about now
*  is everything else around it.
*  Everything around basketball seems more meaningful
*  than the actual sport.
*  We talk about basketball as much in August
*  as we do in the season.
*  It's almost like the games have taken on this strange,
*  almost perfunctory role where they're only there
*  for all this other stuff.
*  And because of it, it becomes completely based
*  on the quality of the celebrities involved.
*  So when LeBron was at his apex,
*  when Curry was doing great, Colby you mentioned,
*  it was like, we're seeing these guys, these people,
*  we're seeing these people, these humans doing this
*  and they're awesome at it.
*  But now those guys are still playing, right?
*  Like Durant's still in the league,
*  Giannis is still in the league.
*  They're not what they used to be.
*  We're familiar with them as celebrities.
*  We're not as interested in them and their success
*  because it's like the game is,
*  they've sort of worn out the juice they had
*  as a new person.
*  They're not new people to us now.
*  They're just familiar people
*  who aren't as good as they once were.
*  So I mean, I really think that there are many reasons
*  that football matters so much to the culture.
*  And I think this is one of the weird ones,
*  which is that in a sense, what we want from a sport
*  is not what we say.
*  Interesting.
*  Yeah, I was thinking, I have a thought of
*  what you said on the basketball piece in the second,
*  but the football piece, the most interesting piece
*  I would add to what you said about football.
*  They changed the rule where you couldn't take your helmet
*  off on the field, right?
*  And that was something guys really started doing
*  because it was the one way you would know
*  what they looked like.
*  And they would do it after a third of the game.
*  They would do it after a third down sack,
*  after a big catch, anything.
*  They would pull the things down and their helmet would off
*  and they'd be like, here's me, here's my face.
*  And the NFL is like, fuck that.
*  Not only are you not doing that,
*  we'll call a penalty even after you've caught
*  like a Hail Mary with three seconds left
*  and you got so excited, your helmet came off.
*  You're never doing that until you get to the sidelines.
*  And it feels like along the lines of what you were saying,
*  they really wanted to make the NFL the product
*  and not the players.
*  I still feel like they need six, seven players to market.
*  They're always gonna need Mahomes, Allen,
*  Burrow, Dak Prescott, maybe Drake May,
*  but they're always gonna need their seven dudes.
*  The quarterbacks that are there for 15, 16 years
*  that we have a history with, but other than that,
*  they don't need anything.
*  The quarterback now, that position has become
*  so outsized compared to the rest.
*  It's almost like a different entity.
*  It's almost like every team has two teams,
*  the team and the quarterback.
*  Did you throw Drake May in there on purpose?
*  Is that what you said?
*  Yeah, I've been trying to shoehorn him
*  into all the great QB conversations.
*  I have a lot of Drake May stock.
*  He's my guy.
*  What was interesting about football
*  is because it's so restricted,
*  but even within with restrictions,
*  you still get a form of originality,
*  like uniforms in the NFL.
*  You gotta wear a certain kind of socks
*  and occasionally, who was that running back a few years back?
*  He wore legal socks.
*  I think he was playing for Washington at the time.
*  May have been a running back from Denver
*  who went over to Washington.
*  I can't remember, but there was discussion
*  about this guy's socks.
*  Yeah.
*  That was enough because there's so many obstructions.
*  There's so many rules that it's kind of like
*  if you send your kid to a private school
*  and they all gotta wear uniforms,
*  and then one kid is like,
*  you know what I'm going to wear though?
*  I'm gonna wear this, I don't know,
*  this sublime pin on my uniform.
*  It's like, oh wow, he finds a way
*  to break the rules with anything.
*  Like in the NBA, in a sense,
*  it's like the guys have more freedom.
*  It's actually in a sense harder for them to be individuals
*  because everyone sort of starts in the default setting
*  of being their own person.
*  One question I didn't ask you just quick.
*  Is Caitlin Clark a bigger under 30 star
*  than any under 30 star in the NBA?
*  Yes.
*  I think she is.
*  Absolutely.
*  Okay.
*  I don't even think that's the debate.
*  Yeah.
*  And it is like, you know,
*  her stardom in a way is,
*  like it has changed many conversations about sports,
*  I feel like, especially women's sports.
*  And I'm interested to how long it will last.
*  And I'm also interested to see if she is just like one of one
*  or if now moving forward.
*  There's more coming, right.
*  40% of the time, the most popular basketball player
*  in the country is a woman.
*  Like if the girl from Yukon comes out
*  and she sort of plays a similar role.
*  And I don't know. Decker's.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, shit, I was excited that UCLA beat South Carolina
*  in a November women's college basketball game.
*  I literally did not care about women's college basketball
*  10 years ago in any way, shape or form.
*  So I think some things have moved
*  toward just the quality of play is more fun to watch,
*  but she seems to be some sort of catalyst
*  that is just, it's like before and after,
*  now we're in the after.
*  I'll be interested to see if it trickles
*  to other women's sports in the same way.
*  I think it really might be a phenomenon to her.
*  And like the question to me is like,
*  if she was a tennis player, would this have happened?
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, I think part of it has to do with it's,
*  it's real difficult now for a guy to become famous
*  in basketball at the collegiate level,
*  but it still seems very plausible for a woman to do that.
*  Well, this is, everyone's made this point
*  and it's super important,
*  but you have this history with these women's players
*  in college for three years, you know,
*  where you're watching them and you start,
*  you can maybe attach yourselves to one of them
*  or you just kind of have a sense of their game.
*  So when they come into WNBA, you know what they can do.
*  All right, off this basketball thing,
*  because you mentioned about,
*  there's, I think it's a really interesting point
*  about the NBA that I've been thinking about a lot.
*  And I've, I've test driven it a couple of times on pods,
*  but about the lack of mystery with NBA stars,
*  like do we have too much access, too much information,
*  too much everything day to day?
*  And I think that's one of the things that I've been thinking
*  about is the fact that there's no mystery left
*  with any of them.
*  And I was trying to think like what celebrities,
*  there's two separate ways I want to go,
*  but I'll go this way first.
*  There's not a lot of celebrities anymore
*  who have mystery to them.
*  I was thinking of Leo is one of the only ones
*  that I really don't know that much about.
*  Like De Niro was able to cultivate this.
*  There's been some musical artists, obviously,
*  like we've always wondered what the fuck was going on
*  with Bob Dylan.
*  Like Lamar has done a really good job of,
*  we don't know that much about him, even though we,
*  we basically know what we know through his music
*  and his lyrics.
*  And I wonder with, with NBA players,
*  cause I was thinking about,
*  it's a 30 year history of follow it,
*  follow a team or a player behind the scenes
*  through a documentary or a docu-series, right?
*  Cause Hoop Dreams came out 30 years ago this fall.
*  I remember, I'll just list a couple
*  and then we can talk about this as a theme.
*  There was a Pat Summit Tennessee HBO documentary in 1998.
*  I think it was called like the Cinderella season.
*  It was like just a year behind the scenes
*  with Tennessee's women's team.
*  And it was amazing.
*  It was like, oh my God, I can't believe they're showing this.
*  And you said all of this access of at that point,
*  all we're doing is watching the team on TV.
*  You just like now all of a sudden I'm watching
*  in the locker room, I'm watching the cry after games.
*  It was incredible.
*  Hard Knocks in 2001, that Raven series,
*  all of a sudden we're with Brian Billick and Ray Lewis
*  and we're watching them practice and cut guys.
*  That was amazing.
*  There was a couple MTV Cribs episodes with athletes.
*  I remember they did a Steve Francis one that I loved
*  that I remember writing about at the time
*  where he went to buy like a Ferrari.
*  There was an incredible Zach Randolph one.
*  So you got a little insight there.
*  There was an awesome show that by the way is not on YouTube,
*  which I can't believe that that show, The Life on ESPN,
*  they followed the Clippers for like six games
*  and Quinton Richardson and Darius Miles.
*  And it was like, here's what these guys' lives are like.
*  I was like, this is the most interesting thing
*  I've ever watched.
*  Then it started to shift.
*  We had that Barry Bonds, what was that called?
*  Bonds on Bonds, whatever it is, that 2006 show
*  where it was like, it took a lot of criticism
*  because it was like, no, this isn't authentic.
*  We're not getting, this isn't journalism.
*  It turned into a big debate at ESPN.
*  It says, should we have shown this or not?
*  Kobe doing work, the Spike Lee thing that he did in 09.
*  I was like, what is this?
*  And then 30 for 30, that's when 30 for 30 really took off
*  and the HBO docs were still full swing.
*  We had a lot of these looking back documentaries.
*  Like we didn't do any follow the team documentaries at all
*  in the first two volumes,
*  but we did do the Steve Nash finish line thing
*  that we did for Grantland
*  where we followed him during the season.
*  And I remember, and you can go back there,
*  pretty interesting actually about,
*  he's near the end of his career trying to hang on
*  and we're just documenting him.
*  And we started, instead of making a documentary,
*  we said the crucial tweak was,
*  let's run these episodes in real time
*  so people can watch them during the season
*  as Nash is playing.
*  This will be cool.
*  Nobody's done this before, which nobody had.
*  And it was really cool.
*  I was really proud of the finish line,
*  but that eventually led to,
*  there was more and more stuff like that
*  because the videos got better, internet video got better,
*  YouTube, there's all these different ways
*  to do real time stuff leading to the first season
*  of that F1 series, Drive to Survive,
*  which completely invigorated and changed the sport,
*  made it appeal to people in America.
*  And I think that was like four or five years ago.
*  And I wonder if we're at the finish line
*  of all this stuff now,
*  because that starting five show on Netflix,
*  people didn't care.
*  I wonder if we just have too much access to everybody.
*  And I know personally,
*  I see this stuff now advertised or whatever,
*  and I'm just like, I'm probably not gonna watch that.
*  Whereas 20 years ago, I would have been like,
*  oh my God, we're in Anthony Edwards' house with his friends?
*  I'll pay whatever the price is for this.
*  So are we at the end?
*  Okay, well, okay, I have a few responses to that.
*  I figured you would.
*  First person you mentioned was DiCaprio.
*  He's kind of a special case, right?
*  Because he is the only superstar like that
*  who was both the last vestige of the old Hollywood system
*  and the beginning sort of of the fan-driven
*  kind of techno-centric fandom.
*  He was the first guy to,
*  he'll be probably the only person
*  who will experience both of those things.
*  Where he was in some ways after Titanic,
*  he was famous in the way John Wayne had been famous.
*  But then he was the beginning of people
*  who are famous in this new way.
*  Where like, it's like, I guess, you know,
*  however you wanna look at, okay?
*  As for these other things you're talking about,
*  everything you're saying is kind of true.
*  And I think, you know, you mentioned that like the first,
*  that Raven's Heart knocks and all these things
*  and how that really did seem crazy.
*  Like really, like I remember really watching that.
*  Well, these are, regardless of the subject,
*  whether it's, you know, F1 racing, football, sports,
*  whatever, what are these things?
*  These things are ultimately art, right?
*  Now, what kills art?
*  What's the thing that most often kills art?
*  What's the thing that most often kills art?
*  It's the lack of authenticity.
*  Self-awareness.
*  When art becomes too ingrained with its own sort of existence,
*  when it becomes to understand what it is,
*  it starts to fall apart.
*  This is what happened with hard knocks now.
*  Like hard knocks is never interesting anymore
*  because we know exactly what it's going to be
*  as does every involved person.
*  They know that if they act a certain way,
*  the response will be this.
*  As a little bit clinical,
*  he will be displayed as hyperclinical.
*  If he comes across kind of like the Lions coach did,
*  like an old school gritty guy, you know,
*  Dan Campbell then becomes this different kind of character.
*  The F1 racing show worked because it was sort of like,
*  this is a new thing.
*  People never thought like, I never followed this.
*  The people in the United States never followed this.
*  The people on that show, I haven't even watched it,
*  but I know enough about it to know that like,
*  it was something that like the first season
*  of the real world or whatever,
*  where people are doing this for the first time,
*  they have no idea what these interviews
*  are actually going to look like once they're on TV.
*  Now everyone knows this, okay?
*  You know, like, so celebrities have completely
*  taken control of their messaging through social media.
*  They don't need now to go through the traditional sources.
*  And as a consequence, what do we have?
*  A lot of banal information about these people.
*  If you let people control how they are perceived
*  and you let them control what their public facing entity is,
*  of course it's not going to be interesting
*  or it's going to be seemed so fake
*  that no one's going to have any like interest in it whatsoever.
*  I mean, the thing about the, like the idea that like, okay,
*  so like Taylor Swift now or someone
*  that never has to give interviews, right?
*  She can just control all that herself.
*  Well now, so that means that there's absolutely
*  no possibility that she's ever going to have
*  to address something she doesn't want to address.
*  You know, and that is where a lot of this tension
*  comes from, right?
*  It comes from the small sort of moments
*  where somebody has to answer a question
*  that they would prefer not to be in public, right?
*  And that's just, that's not going to happen anymore.
*  So as we've sort of, all of these things you've mentioned,
*  I don't think you're sick of them.
*  You're just comfortable with them.
*  Like, you know what you're supposed to see
*  and something has to be outside of that for it to be good.
*  I mean, like in that, in those Netflix shows,
*  like the one about the quarterbacks or whatever,
*  like, you know, occasionally there'd be
*  a small interesting moment.
*  Like Kirk Cousin has a little secret room in his house
*  where he keeps all his stuff.
*  And he has like in his backyard, he has this huge fire pit,
*  like the biggest fire pit I've ever seen.
*  He had nothing, neither of those things
*  mean anything about football.
*  It was just like, oh, this is something
*  I didn't expect to see.
*  In most of the things you're describing,
*  we now see what we expect.
*  And it's the inauthentic version of what we're seeing.
*  That's the other thing.
*  So, and I've made this point before,
*  but it's something that,
*  think how many autobiographies we read over the years.
*  Right?
*  Some of those autobiographies,
*  they're being spun by the person who wrote them.
*  Like my favorite, which you love too,
*  is the Wilt Chamberlain autobiography,
*  the one, the Wilt, Man Above or whatever,
*  the picture of him.
*  It's like one of the most fun books
*  you're gonna read about sports,
*  because Wilt's not self-aware as he's writing the book.
*  So it's his take on stuff and he really believes it.
*  And it's kind of crazy half the time,
*  but it's also like real access in his life,
*  real access in how he thought about stuff.
*  And you leave the book going,
*  I can see why he was so frustrated and to play with.
*  I could see why he was traded three times, right?
*  Whereas Bill Russell, like you read Second Wind
*  and it's like, holy shit.
*  Like this is one of the most thoughtful people we had
*  in the 1960s and early 70s
*  about everything that was going on in America.
*  I always feel like you can get value out of autobiographies.
*  And I want to feel that way about some of these,
*  follow the people around, follow the players around,
*  and I just don't.
*  And I find myself not watching them anymore, like at all.
*  I don't watch any of them.
*  Well, it was like this Ted Turner documentary
*  that's coming out.
*  It's a documentary series about Ted Turner,
*  which I was kind of interested in
*  until I found out he has complete control over it.
*  It's like, I have, why would I,
*  like a Wikipedia entry would be better in some ways,
*  because at least it would be somebody
*  who's giving the information without sort of,
*  I mean, it's not that these things are immediately terrible
*  because the person is involved.
*  That's, I don't want to say that,
*  but I mean, it has become,
*  this has become seemingly like a common move now
*  for people lately.
*  Well, because you make money and it's your,
*  it's basically the video version of autobiography.
*  That was one of the things,
*  when we did the Vitzhuk Band thing,
*  you know what, I just don't want to be involved
*  in stuff like that.
*  So it wasn't, it was like, hey, we trust you guys,
*  make the best possible doc.
*  How did you ultimately feel about that?
*  I thought it was really good to be honest,
*  but I didn't know any of that stuff
*  in terms of like anything post like 1999.
*  Like I didn't know anything that had gone in wrestling
*  in that world since then.
*  But what, like, how did you feel about having worked on it
*  all those years?
*  I mean, I was pumped with how it came out
*  because it just seemed like it was going to die
*  three different times and the story kept changing
*  and it's so hard to work on something like that
*  when you feel like you're headed toward
*  whatever you thought was going to be the version of it
*  and then you have to flip it and change it again
*  and not know what was coming next,
*  not knowing if Netflix was going to pull out.
*  So it was a roller coaster, but you know,
*  you're trying to,
*  when you're trying to make something like that,
*  I think that's different than what we're talking about
*  because we're trying to make a document,
*  a real documentary about somebody that they participated in
*  and did an interview with,
*  but didn't have creative control over
*  and trying to capture like,
*  what was this?
*  What was this career?
*  What was this impact?
*  Was this guy a shrewd businessman?
*  Was he a bad person?
*  Like you're trying to juggle all of these things,
*  but you're also trying to do it
*  for the widest possible audience, right?
*  So it's just different goals.
*  I think the stuff we're talking about with this is like,
*  if any athlete or musician releases a big documentary
*  about themselves that they're executive producers of
*  or that their production company did,
*  we should regard it the same way we would regard
*  somebody just writing, releasing an autobiography,
*  but I don't know if we're there yet culturally.
*  I still feel like people don't understand the difference
*  between documentaries and, you know,
*  basically self-produced hagiographies.
*  Well, cause sometimes they look the same.
*  I mean, that is the problem.
*  Right, it's a trick.
*  It's like the modality of it makes it look the same.
*  I mean, this is the same way with like when say
*  broadcast news became very partisan, right?
*  It still looks the way news used to look.
*  It's still somebody sitting in front of a desk
*  giving you information.
*  There's a screen behind them showing kind of illustrate,
*  you know, images that illustrate their point.
*  It looks formally the way news looked
*  when Walter Cronkite worked, but it's not, right?
*  These documentaries look the way, you know,
*  I'm trying to think of like an older documentary
*  that looks the same as the ones now,
*  but we know it was different because this is the time.
*  I guess the assumption of what it would be.
*  Well, you said like, you know, spinning an autobiography.
*  I mean, I guess every autobiography
*  is kind of a spin job, right?
*  It's like, you know, it's rare that somebody
*  would write a memoir.
*  Well, how many times does somebody say,
*  write a biography of me, here are the car keys.
*  You can interview all the people in my life
*  and however it turns out, it turns out.
*  It used to happen a lot.
*  It doesn't happen as much anymore because.
*  That happened with the Jan Wynner biography.
*  Right, and think about how that played out.
*  Yes, yes.
*  I mean, that might be the last time
*  someone like does that, you know?
*  And it wasn't even that it was just like incredibly unfair,
*  which is kind of unfair, but the guy had a perspective.
*  The writer, like Joe Hagan wrote the book
*  and he's like, I have ideas about this too.
*  I'm putting them in there.
*  Right.
*  Well, but there's another piece of this
*  where if all of the celebrities we have,
*  for the most part, there's a couple exceptions,
*  but they're super available all over the place.
*  Right, in the old days, it was,
*  there was an infrastructure with celebrities of,
*  you released a movie, who's that?
*  Like think of like Kathleen Turner in 1981.
*  She becomes famous and it's like, well, who is this?
*  And there would be maybe a giant Rolling Stone
*  profile about her.
*  She'd go on Letterman, maybe she'd go on Carson.
*  Other than that, you didn't really know anything about her.
*  And now there's this whole infrastructure in place.
*  So like, you haven't seen a Nora yet,
*  but Mikey Madison's like unbelievable in that movie.
*  Mikey Madison's been around, you know,
*  she became famous social media happened, right?
*  She's social media president.
*  She's done podcasts.
*  I felt like I, not only did I know who she was,
*  but I'd seen her and stuff and had a feel for who she was.
*  There wasn't the same kind of mystique
*  cause she'd been around and she'd been around
*  in a 21st century way.
*  And I felt, you almost feel like you know somebody,
*  obviously you don't.
*  But I feel like if that Nora comes out in 1982,
*  it'd be like, holy shit, who is this actress?
*  And you just wouldn't really have any way
*  to find out anything about her,
*  other than these little tiny pieces.
*  It's just so different.
*  It's strange.
*  I think the promotion probably hurts them, you know?
*  Like you say, like, you know, like I, I,
*  how the idea of being an actor is that you're like,
*  you're, you're completely, you know,
*  you're someone who isn't you.
*  So it's to your advantage if we don't know who you are.
*  But that's like, I don't know if that's really
*  a possible thing anymore.
*  By the way, now that I'm looking at this,
*  I'm not sure if Mikey Madison's on Instagram.
*  So maybe there's, maybe she's more mysterious
*  than I thought.
*  But.
*  But like you, even like you and I are talking right now
*  and it seems like we're just, you know,
*  I think both of us feel like we're just having like,
*  you know, a free flowing conversation.
*  Yeah.
*  And that we're both just sort of talking off the top
*  of the dome or whatever.
*  But we do, I guess have creative control, right?
*  If I accidentally said something extremely provocative
*  and dangerous, we would take it out or could take it out
*  if we wanted to.
*  Right.
*  So is this, is this unreal?
*  Like, you know, or like, like, or like.
*  That's why I like doing the Sunday Nights with Sal
*  cause it's like, we're just live on YouTube.
*  Here we go.
*  There's no safety net at all.
*  So you do it live?
*  You do them complete, like it's going out.
*  We do them on YouTube.
*  Yeah. We record the whole podcast as it's happening.
*  And I think it's fun.
*  And then it stays on YouTube.
*  So if something was troubling, it would still be there.
*  It's a lot of YouTube.
*  I didn't know you were doing that.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a strange deal.
*  Like, okay, you've had, you know, I'm guessing dozens,
*  maybe hundreds of profiles written about you in your life.
*  How many, what percentage of them would you say
*  had something wrong in the story?
*  Something, something that was either not really what you meant.
*  I think when, when you're written about,
*  I don't think you're ever going to be happy
*  with how it came out.
*  It's just, it's just a fact.
*  But I also, I mean, I haven't done,
*  I don't think I've done an interview in like, like that
*  in probably the entire 2020s.
*  But I think what you realize is if you don't need to do them,
*  it's, you'd rather just kind of not do them.
*  I mean, yeah, I remember you wrote that.
*  What was the one you wrote?
*  The Tom Brady one?
*  Yeah.
*  Which you've had, you've had a few that were great
*  and great for you.
*  And I'm not sure it was great
*  for the person you were writing about.
*  Sure, that's true.
*  But what I, what I, what I'm saying more like is, okay,
*  so like I asked you this question,
*  I could have asked myself this
*  because I've had profiles written about me too.
*  And I would say if somebody asked me what percentage
*  of those stories had something wrong in them,
*  I would say probably it feels like a hundred percent, right?
*  Feels like a hundred percent to me.
*  But there's always been something in there that was either,
*  that was like, if nothing else,
*  like a misinterpretation of what I meant.
*  Like they used a quote of mine and they quoted me accurately,
*  but that wasn't really what I meant.
*  So I think to myself then,
*  so let's say I had control over that profile.
*  Let's say that the writer had to send me the piece
*  and I got to fix these.
*  You had to send them edits?
*  Yes.
*  I will say like, you know, cause sometimes, you know,
*  and younger writers will do that sometimes.
*  But I think to myself, it's like, so would that,
*  that would better reflect what I actually meant.
*  If someone is reading this story,
*  you would think that what they would want from it
*  is they're reading about me or they want to know about me.
*  If they're reading about you, they want to know about you.
*  So they would actually, you would think,
*  want the most accurate depiction of how that person feels.
*  But yet we would not, we don't take that as seriously, right?
*  Like if it turned out, if you were in a profile of someone
*  and at the bottom of the story, it said that
*  the subject was given this story beforehand
*  and allowed to fact check and make changes to quotes
*  and stuff like that, we'd be like, oh, it's all,
*  it means nothing.
*  Even though that actually would be what the,
*  how the person wants to be understood.
*  And that should be the goal.
*  So it's, so it is, it is a complicated deal.
*  It's like, we trust documentaries more
*  if the person doesn't have control
*  and the documentary filmmaker has kind of adversarial
*  with them because we don't trust the subject,
*  but somehow we're supposed to trust the filmmaker.
*  Like what, why, why do we trust
*  the filmmakers' perception on this?
*  Why, why are they the person who can kind of be
*  the arbiter of reality?
*  And it's the person who we're watching
*  should have absolutely no say in this
*  or should be sort of forced to be themselves
*  and then live with the result.
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, these are like, you know, I.
*  Well, you know what's interesting about this?
*  If you're actually making a real documentary
*  that's not, you know, a hagiography
*  or like a self-produced thing or whatever,
*  you do have a responsibility.
*  This becomes a document, right?
*  And you're shaping people's perceptions
*  of the people that are in it, right?
*  So I just went through this with the Celtics documentary
*  we did, which is like nine parts.
*  It covers 75 years.
*  You're actually in it.
*  And what happened with The Last Dance
*  was really informative for how we were thinking
*  about the Celtics thing because in that case,
*  like Jason Harris, my friend, like he played it perfectly.
*  He had the iPad with Jordan.
*  There was some real Jordan Isaiah attention
*  and you know, dysfunction between those guys.
*  You have the iPad.
*  So, but the two biggest losers, I think,
*  coming out of the documentary were Isaiah and Pippen.
*  And the Pippen thing, I don't even know
*  if he watched the whole thing,
*  because when you get to episode, the last episode,
*  when he basically helped save the 1998 finals,
*  he's like a hero and he's playing hurt.
*  He's on a shitty contract.
*  He's carrying himself like, but Pippen latched onto
*  what happened when he asked out of the Knicks game,
*  which he just didn't want to hear
*  that that was part of his legacy.
*  I thought all that stuff was fair keeping that in.
*  I think what you can do though,
*  if it's in the wrong hands is shift certain things
*  against people or for people,
*  if you're trying to create heroes and villains.
*  And I do think like some documentary people think about
*  what's gonna be cut out and put on Twitter.
*  Oh, I got this awesome soundbite.
*  And what it does is, especially if you're making a document,
*  sometimes you really have to be careful,
*  including stuff that might not be true
*  that somebody's saying, right?
*  As the years pass,
*  like think about the close friend family vacation
*  and you got like your 80 year old uncle,
*  and he just says some,
*  has some crazy memory from 40 years ago.
*  It's just not true.
*  And it's like, no, that's not what happened uncle Al.
*  It's actually this, like that can't be in the documentary.
*  This is still a document.
*  Whether he said it or not, whether it's good TV,
*  that doesn't mean it should be in.
*  And I do feel like we're even losing that,
*  but that I worry about like this next wave
*  of documentary directors.
*  I've obviously made a bunch of them.
*  Like hearing stuff toward what might play on Twitter
*  or what may play on TikTok is, I think, you know,
*  you're incentivizing the wrong thing.
*  Oh, absolutely.
*  I mean, this is kind of far field, but like, you know,
*  talking about media type stuff or whatever,
*  it's like, who would have thought
*  that it would have been terrible for like newspapers,
*  like the Times and the Washington Post
*  to be less dependent on advertising
*  and more based on subscribers.
*  Like everybody would have thought in the 1990s,
*  we were just like, well, what if we didn't have to worry
*  about whether or not Ford advertises with our newspaper?
*  What if we could just give people what they want?
*  You know, we thought that would be better.
*  And now that's kind of what it is.
*  And it's so much worse because now the reader is not,
*  is kind of seen as a, like a customer, you know?
*  So we're going to give them what they want.
*  You see this with headlines all the time.
*  It's like, I will see the headline to a story
*  and I will think to myself, it's like,
*  that can't be what the story is about.
*  And 95% of the time I'm right,
*  that the headline was so much more provocative
*  and bombastic than what the actual information is,
*  but what do they need?
*  They need me to sort of engage with it.
*  The thing about the last answer, as I was gonna say,
*  it's like, also it's, like, I have a theory
*  of what really bothered Pippen about that
*  more than anything else.
*  Does he, all the other stuff,
*  the stuff about him pulling himself out of that game,
*  he probably expected that to be there.
*  He's dealt with that before.
*  I love Pippen.
*  When I wrote about him in my book,
*  I wrote a whole probably page about that game
*  because I thought it really unfairly shaped his legacy
*  as a player.
*  It was the first thing people pointed to.
*  So for it not to be in the documentary in a real way
*  would have been disingenuous.
*  But I mean, and this might be a projection,
*  but if I'm Pippen, you know what part of that documentary
*  would have drove me insane?
*  The time when Jordan says, you know, you gotta say it,
*  Pippen was the best player I played with.
*  He was my best teammate.
*  If I'm Scottie Pippen, I'm like, yes, obviously yes.
*  Why are you, like-
*  Right, why does that need a qualifier?
*  Yes, like why would you have to mention
*  that as if there's anyone out there who doesn't think that?
*  That's the kind of thing
*  when you're in a personal relationship with someone
*  that really bothers you, right?
*  Like, it was like Jordan is giving him a compliment.
*  Jordan would probably say like,
*  I couldn't give a bigger compliment, you know?
*  But in this case, it's not, right?
*  Because everyone in the world
*  thinks that is the case already.
*  And for Jordan to mention it,
*  it almost implies like it's up for debate.
*  When like Bird would say, his best teammate,
*  his favorite team was Dennis Johnson.
*  That was always like, oh, more than Mikhail, huh?
*  That, you're interesting, you know?
*  It's like, I can see it, but you know, it does,
*  it's a real compliment, right?
*  Because he's saying something
*  that the world doesn't necessarily assume to be true.
*  When Jordan says Pippen was his best teammate
*  and the best player he played with,
*  and it's something that prior to Jordan even saying that,
*  it wouldn't have even been a question.
*  Nobody was ever debating who Jordan's best teammate was,
*  or did Jordan play with any good players?
*  That question is never brought up, right?
*  Like Pippen's one of the 50 best players of all time,
*  or 75 now, or whatever the fucking list is.
*  But I remember thinking if I was him, and I heard that,
*  I would have lost my mind, you know?
*  Yeah, you know?
*  Yeah, because to me it's like,
*  I've said a million times,
*  Jordan's the best player I've ever seen,
*  and he's always gonna be number one for me.
*  Somebody would really have to take it.
*  But Pippen to me is such a big piece of,
*  like still watching them together,
*  especially as they got a little older when Jordan came back,
*  that was one of the great sports fan thrills of my life,
*  seeing those two guys play basketball together.
*  They were so in sync, and they were so great as a combo.
*  And I've only really seen that a couple times
*  on a basketball court,
*  the way those guys kind of coexisted
*  and made each other better.
*  I can't even think of anybody in the NBA now who does that.
*  Like I watch the Celtics as a team,
*  show flashes of it,
*  and I almost feel like they're not like Brown and Tatum.
*  It almost needs like two more years to cultivate,
*  but those guys really have this chemistry now
*  of when to know, all right, you take this one.
*  All right, I'll take this.
*  And there's no ego left with them.
*  It feels like Mitchell and Garland
*  are starting to develop that a little bit in Cleveland,
*  but you know it when you see it.
*  Whereas like you watch Minnesota,
*  and it's like, oh shit, this Randall Edwards thing.
*  Yikes, like they need to figure this out.
*  Do you feel like the NBA has to make some real changes
*  for the product?
*  I feel that way.
*  I've been thinking about it a lot
*  about whether there should be a cap on threes,
*  whether you just get 43s in a game and that's it.
*  It's a crazy idea, but I'm also like if they did this,
*  I might think it's fine.
*  Or just second quarter, nobody, threes or twos.
*  Well, no, it would have to be a situation.
*  What you're saying is like one of the things on the clock
*  is like the number 40,
*  and every time someone shoots a three, it counts down.
*  Because then some teams need to save some
*  for the end or whatever.
*  But I don't like, that's kind of a,
*  it's too weird for me.
*  It feels too radical.
*  But like Celtics Clippers last night,
*  the Celtics killed the Clippers.
*  Somebody texted me the first half shot chart,
*  and it was just, it was all threes around the arc,
*  and then stuff in the paint.
*  And I think there was like one shot from 12 feet,
*  and I'm like, what are we doing?
*  People have been theorizing this is one reason
*  the NBA ratings are down.
*  I think Derek Thompson nailed it when it was six,
*  nine months ago when he was saying how it's really easy
*  to follow the NBA in a crazy passionate way
*  without actually watching the games,
*  or just watching fourth quarters or pieces of game.
*  I think that's the biggest issue with the league.
*  There's too many games.
*  I mean, he's a smart guy,
*  but there's a flaw in that thinking though.
*  What is it?
*  The flaw in that thinking is when you make something easier
*  to follow that typically does not decrease the amount
*  people want to see it for real.
*  I mean, it's totally easy to follow the NFL
*  without watching the games.
*  You can do it in the exact same way,
*  but that has actually spurred me.
*  But the NFL has two things.
*  The NFL is gambling and fantasy.
*  The NBA doesn't have either of those things
*  in the same way.
*  Well, I know, I play fantasy basketball,
*  and it's driving me crazy
*  because everyone's hurt all the time.
*  That's a huge issue.
*  Oh, I retired.
*  I give up.
*  Fantasy basketball is done.
*  I mean, it's like, I can't.
*  You can't do it.
*  I can't.
*  It's just got like, I don't know.
*  It almost seemed better with load management.
*  I mean, I just, I don't even know what it's,
*  like my suspicion is because NBA teams
*  just don't practice anymore.
*  And when they, it's all sort of like
*  individual training sessions for these guys,
*  to get ready for the year.
*  Well, this is like.
*  That when they start playing games, they all get hurt.
*  I mean, I got a fantasy team where it's like
*  14 guys around the team.
*  I can't put, I have like seven guys hurt
*  or eight guys hurt.
*  I can't figure out what to do.
*  Right.
*  There's too many games and basketball's harder to play.
*  I'm gonna die on that hill.
*  I firmly believe there's more running
*  that's just harder on your body.
*  Even the equipment, I've talked about this,
*  but even the equipment's better.
*  It's the no practice thing.
*  But there's no, it can't.
*  Anytime you, if you talk.
*  What?
*  It can't be harder than football.
*  It's not.
*  It's not just the more demanding.
*  Oh no, I'm saying just basketball
*  compared to basketball in the past,
*  even though the shoes are better,
*  all the stuff that, all the stuff we've always talked about.
*  But like the no practice thing
*  is such a big thing with coaches.
*  You can, I remember when Doc, Doc got the Milwaukee job,
*  I have some friends with Doc, just talking to him.
*  He took that job, they were playing
*  and they just hadn't had a chance to practice
*  for weeks and weeks and weeks.
*  And he was saying, just to me, like,
*  just people don't understand how hard it is to not practice.
*  You don't understand like how damaging that is
*  when you have this schedule piece
*  where it's like three, four weeks in a row.
*  You just know you're not gonna practice.
*  Cause it's not even, the top eight guys are fine.
*  It's everyone else on the roster.
*  They just atrophy.
*  This is one of the crazy things about Bronte being
*  in the NBA now and just not playing.
*  And he doesn't play in the,
*  he's only playing G League home games,
*  but he doesn't play for the Lakers.
*  Like what's the point of him being in the league?
*  I don't understand it.
*  Well, yeah, that ended up looking, I mean.
*  It's terrible.
*  That's, I, in a sense, I feel like if we're talking about,
*  like, LeBron's career has been remarkably absent
*  of major missteps.
*  Really for a long time, it was just the decision.
*  But in some ways, this one was almost worse to me.
*  Why?
*  Because there was nothing like,
*  so the goal was to have this sort of meaningful moment
*  where a father and son played on the court at the same time.
*  And it ended up having no meaning at all.
*  Like none.
*  The entire thing seemed like a construct.
*  There seemed to be nothing natural about it.
*  The fact that he's already in the G League
*  and may never be in the NBA again or whatever.
*  It's like, well, so what good would this do?
*  Like what, like it was bad for Bronnie for sure.
*  I mean, it's gonna damage the way he is perceived.
*  It's made him be perceived worse than he is.
*  It's not as though we look at LeBron now and be like,
*  well, that's like one more thing that he accomplished.
*  I think the opposite is true.
*  Maybe even he feels this way now.
*  I don't know, but.
*  Yeah, I don't.
*  I didn't understand it as it was happening
*  because the high school resume didn't match
*  what people were really saying.
*  Like even like Jared McCain was here in LA and he was,
*  I was tweeting about it during the draft.
*  Jared McCain is unbelievable.
*  He was unbelievable in LA.
*  He was the best guard here for three years.
*  His team's always won.
*  He was fucking awesome.
*  He went to Duke.
*  You could see it the second half of the year.
*  He was awesome there.
*  And it was just clearly gonna be really good.
*  It just felt like Bronnie should have been in college
*  for like at least three years,
*  just trying to get better and trying to conquer that level
*  before you go to the next one.
*  Sure, but when you say like, I didn't understand it,
*  it's like you did understand it.
*  The thing is, you feel like you shouldn't understand it.
*  This is a, I'll try to be not too far on this,
*  but I feel like this is something that I see a lot
*  when people are talking about the news in any sense.
*  They're saying they don't understand something
*  and they do understand it, but we feel like we shouldn't.
*  For some reason, the idea of a kid playing with his father,
*  even though he isn't warranted,
*  that we should be like, that makes no sense.
*  It makes complete sense.
*  We all know why it happened.
*  I mean, it was like, I thought of this one,
*  this Tyson-Paul fight.
*  Leading up to that fight,
*  I started getting tons of texts from people
*  asking if I was gonna watch it
*  or what we thought of it or whatever,
*  to the point where I suddenly realized
*  almost every guy I know is gonna watch this.
*  I don't know what the final numbers on that thing was.
*  They had to have been massive, right?
*  Now, so there was all these ideas,
*  like maybe Tyson will just come out
*  and just knock him out with one punch.
*  Maybe Tyson's too old.
*  Maybe he'll get hurt real bad.
*  Like there was all these different ideas
*  of what it might be, you know?
*  And then as it turns out, it was exactly
*  what the most predictable outcome would be.
*  Like a pretty uninteresting, not very physical fight
*  that feels like it might have been rigged,
*  even though it probably wasn't dramatic at all.
*  Now, it was probably good for boxing, right?
*  Because the undercards were pretty good fights.
*  People watch these fights for surprise.
*  The women's fight was one of the greatest
*  women's fights ever, yeah.
*  Yes, people, you know?
*  So it probably was good for the sport,
*  but in another sense, it was just like,
*  it was just like a domino effect
*  of just sort of made up events,
*  all kind of falling in a row in the way
*  that in the most predictable fashion.
*  I don't know, it was very strange.
*  It was like, it seemed strangely symbolic to me.
*  You know, it's like the fact that like,
*  so Tyson sort of represents the past.
*  He sort of represents our generation, right?
*  Like he was like kind of a Gen X figure,
*  I guess in some ways, you know?
*  And then he'd had this life where life of crime
*  and these terrible acts, but then he comes back
*  and he's fighting this guy.
*  He's fighting this guy who sort of represents
*  almost like a caricature of young people now
*  or the young adult person now, you know?
*  That his entire life is based around his ability
*  to sort of generate celebrity on his own
*  through social media and all these things.
*  And then everyone's rooting against the guy, right?
*  It seemed like everyone was rooting for Tyson,
*  despite Tyson's life.
*  Like people were like, we're on his side sort of.
*  So it's like this person who represents
*  the way the world is now, the way sports works now,
*  the way media works now, nobody wanted that guy to win.
*  And it seemed like almost it was people saying like,
*  we want Tyson to win this fight
*  because it will mean that the world's not really going
*  in this direction.
*  That if Tyson wins this fight,
*  it sort of says the way things have changed
*  is not good in any way.
*  Like not only do we not like this Jake Paul character,
*  but we don't like what he really represents
*  about how sports works now.
*  We don't like how the way entertainment works.
*  And if he gets knocked out, it'll show that it was all
*  this sort of like fragile fake thing.
*  And when he fights a real person,
*  a guy who's actually a real fighter,
*  when he actually gets punched for the first time,
*  he's going to collapse and this house of cards
*  is gonna collapse.
*  But that's not what happened.
*  It was the most predictable outcome.
*  It was just a slow, laborious fight
*  where a guy who's too old to be out there
*  was able to sort of manage being with a guy
*  whose main goal seemed to make sure that the event finished.
*  So it felt like people couldn't say
*  they got financially ripped off.
*  And it's just, like Paul bows to Tyson
*  at one point in the fight.
*  So he was like, we're honoring you in this.
*  Like, that's not a fight.
*  That's not boxing or whatever.
*  But yeah, we're not surprised.
*  Like, it is exactly what we thought it would be.
*  Well, you know, it speaks to what we talked about earlier
*  with the election.
*  Even as the fight was midway through the fight,
*  people were like, I knew it.
*  I knew this was gonna suck.
*  Oh my God.
*  It's like, well, before the fight,
*  Tyson was plus 170 to win, right?
*  Jake Paul was a two to one favorite.
*  Everybody claimed they knew after the fact
*  it was gonna be this terrible.
*  But a lot of people thought Tyson was gonna win.
*  And then once we started to see the results of the fight,
*  we were like, oh yeah, of course, the guy's 58.
*  He's, you know, admitted long time,
*  used all kinds of drugs, has led a really hard life,
*  got knocked out multiple times when he boxed,
*  had some sort of health event in June
*  that seemed really bad.
*  It was like, what made anyone, including me,
*  think that there was even a slim chance this would happen?
*  It was because it's what people wanted to happen.
*  They wanted it to be the Rocky Balboa movie.
*  Yeah, well, I think that there was also this sense
*  that when the first bell rang,
*  like maybe Tyson's gonna come out and charge him
*  and he's gonna hit him one time.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's suddenly gonna become obvious.
*  But what became obvious was that,
*  oh, they're actually gonna go through with all this.
*  This is not really, it's not what it's gonna be.
*  It's weird.
*  It was like, I don't know if I can even say
*  it was a disappointment,
*  because how can I be disappointed
*  if I'm admitting that's what I knew was going to happen?
*  Yeah, I wrote a piece, first year I was at page two,
*  I wrote a piece about how it was over for Tyson
*  after he got knocked out by Lettuce Lewis.
*  Whole thing, I was like, this is it.
*  Literally, 2002, I didn't even move to LA yet,
*  I don't think.
*  All right, we're gonna end with the Sopranos.
*  I've been rewatching it yet again,
*  and you texted me how you've been watching it as well.
*  And we haven't talked about this
*  other than that just, you know that about me,
*  I know that about you.
*  And you really wanted to talk about it.
*  I kind of really want to talk about it too.
*  I'm interested if it's for the same reason, so you go.
*  Well, okay, so I'll just quickly get into how this happened.
*  So, for a variety of reasons,
*  I ended up watching the last episode of Mad Men,
*  the series finale of Mad Men.
*  And that was very surprising to me,
*  because of course I remembered what happened to Don.
*  Do you remember what happened to any of the other characters,
*  to most of the other characters?
*  I haven't seen that.
*  I've been saving that for a rewatch too.
*  I don't remember one other thing that happened
*  other than the ending.
*  Okay, like did you remember that Peggy ended up with Stan?
*  I totally remember.
*  Do you remember that Roger apparently moves to France?
*  It's like Pete Campbell moves to Wichita.
*  All these things I had forgotten.
*  It blew my mind.
*  All these things I didn't remember about this show,
*  which I watch really closely or whatever.
*  So then I was like,
*  I wonder if the same thing would happen
*  to the last episode of The Sopranos.
*  So I watched the last episode of Sopranos again,
*  because I also had watched that documentary
*  that was really good.
*  That's what got me back into it.
*  I really liked it.
*  Yeah.
*  And it was, I watched the last episode
*  and it was not what I remembered,
*  because again, I only remembered the very end of it.
*  But it was good.
*  So I ended up watching a few more episodes
*  from that last season.
*  And then I decided like, this is so enriching to me.
*  I'm gonna go back and rewatch the third season.
*  And one thing it does is it really shows me
*  how much television was just better during this period.
*  Like that was just really,
*  and it's not to blame anybody making television now.
*  It's that this was like a collection of things
*  that were happening in the culture.
*  That it was, it's like the depth of every character
*  is incredible.
*  Well season three, season three is also the most violent
*  of all the seasons too.
*  And Chase is really going for a lot.
*  I think season three is really, really great,
*  but he's going for a lot of themes in that one too.
*  Yes, yes.
*  And you know, but also like, not in obvious ways,
*  like all the stuff with the racehorse.
*  It's kind of interesting.
*  Carmelo and Furo being together, that's kind of-
*  Well that's season four though.
*  Season three is when Ralphie kills the dancer.
*  Maybe I'm already, yes.
*  Dr. Melfi rape scene, like there's, it's pretty violent.
*  I guess I'm in season four now.
*  I guess I must've started with three and I'm moving four
*  because I'm just hitting forward.
*  Maybe I'm getting, you know.
*  So I guess I'm in the middle of it.
*  I'm just saying that those, that these,
*  the storylines for these characters,
*  it's just so, it's really funny.
*  All the stuff with Christopher is real great.
*  He's such a, you know, Christopher is such a likable
*  character despite sort of how his life plays out.
*  He's such a likable fuck up.
*  Well, it's not just that.
*  He's like, he seems like he's trying.
*  Like he's really trying, you know?
*  Like he wants to make these things work.
*  He wants to make everyone happy in a way.
*  He is in some degree selfish, but it's like, it is,
*  what did you want to say about it?
*  Because it's like, I just, I have really enjoyed
*  this experience.
*  If you watch it again, and, well okay, go ahead.
*  Here she go.
*  I think, so I rewatched it like two years ago.
*  Probably rewatched it five years before that.
*  So I think this is like either my fourth or fifth rewatch.
*  And I think it's one of the great pieces of art
*  that we've produced this last, I don't know, 25, 30 years.
*  There's no question.
*  And one of the reasons I think that is,
*  when I watch it, I pick up new stuff every time.
*  And it's almost like reading like the best books
*  you've ever read, or your favorite books when you're a kid
*  or a teenager where you're just like,
*  I'm just gonna read this book again.
*  This book is so good.
*  I want to dive back in.
*  I want to study how this author like turned phrases
*  and turned sentences and how they,
*  maybe I'll notice something different this time.
*  That was what we grew up doing.
*  You'd have 10, 12, 15 books you loved
*  and you would read them, I don't know how many times.
*  I can see it with some of the books I have in my library.
*  And the sopranos to me, I pick up stuff every time.
*  I think it was so much more sophisticated
*  and well thought out that maybe I appreciated
*  the first and second times I watched it,
*  all the characters, all the stuff as you get older
*  that Chase is trying to say about family,
*  about mortality, about who do you trust in your life?
*  Is all this shit worth it?
*  Like there's just themes that I wouldn't have picked up
*  the first time I watched it from 1999 to 2007.
*  Cause in the moment, you're just invested in the characters.
*  You're trying to figure who's gonna die,
*  which Chase really turns the audience on a couple times.
*  Chase doesn't like that people gravitated
*  the violence of the show in the moment.
*  So he made season three becomes intentionally violent.
*  Like he's really trying to fuck with the audience.
*  But I think the characters and what he created,
*  it's all been discussed a million times,
*  but I still feel like it's more interesting
*  than any new show I can watch.
*  Well, watching him in a row is interesting too,
*  because I now recognize how watching it a week apart
*  altered my experience with it.
*  In a sense that like, okay, when the series was ending,
*  especially right when it got over,
*  there was all those people writing about the Sopranos.
*  And they were like, why did people relate to Tony Soprano?
*  He's like an obviously terrible person.
*  He's like a completely transgressive, awful person.
*  And when you watch them all in a row,
*  like when I'm kind of like, I guess,
*  binging them or whatever, I'm just trying,
*  you really do see that, right?
*  But when you're watching them a week apart,
*  it didn't feel that way.
*  Because in every episode, maybe he would do something bad,
*  but he would also do one thing that was charming.
*  And then somehow like he would have,
*  he would say something to Mille Fe,
*  or he'd say something to his kids,
*  or he'd just do something that was likable,
*  and sort of balanced it out.
*  But when you watch them all in a row,
*  you really see what kind of a diabolical person he is,
*  and like how just completely like bottom line person he is.
*  But what else is weird is that even though
*  I'm watching this again,
*  and I'm maybe more clearly seeing
*  that this character is just really,
*  just like a bad dude,
*  in some ways I relate to this.
*  Even though, I mean, I don't know how I can say
*  I can relate to a gang.
*  But sort of his sense of
*  the things he questions about his own life,
*  like you mentioned.
*  Maybe it's just because I'm older now.
*  There are certain things, moments in that show
*  when I'm like, I know how that is,
*  I know how he feels right now.
*  Like I know what that is like.
*  And that's something I do not remember
*  from the first time I watched it.
*  Yeah, the Tony piece,
*  I think the reason we were all attracted to him
*  as a character was he's completely authentic,
*  and he's always on brand at all times.
*  Like he's so well written and so well sketched out.
*  But all the decisions he's making in real time,
*  you believe in 100%, whether they're good or bad.
*  It's like, oh yeah, like when he goes,
*  he's in the Mercedes-Dior ship,
*  after he sees what's her face,
*  the Annabella Siura character,
*  when he's with her in therapy,
*  the first time they meet,
*  they're just in the waiting office.
*  It's like, oh no, this is gonna be bad for Tony.
*  And then it's like, he shows up at the Mercedes-Dior ship,
*  because of course he does.
*  And you just know it's gonna end badly.
*  Every piece of how they cultivate his character
*  over the course from season one to season seven,
*  like adds up when you watch it.
*  I can't think of another show,
*  like even shows like Lost,
*  like Breaking Bad had moments where it kind of went sideways,
*  people were complaining about certain things
*  in The Sopranos.
*  I can't really complain about anything.
*  I don't love the Ralphie character in season three
*  and season four, the Joey Pants character.
*  I don't feel like Chase ever solved that character completely,
*  but when he gets to Buscemi in season five,
*  playing the other Tony,
*  he had everything.
*  That character was well-sketched out, beautifully acted,
*  but also really made sense against Tony.
*  And it was like this alternate version
*  of where Tony's life could have gone.
*  I think of all the stuff he had to do with the show,
*  where you're having, I don't know, 15 main characters,
*  four characters you really have to care about,
*  but then this whole other,
*  like there's another 50 on the show,
*  and all of them make sense and interconnect together.
*  I honestly don't know how they did it.
*  This is one of the rare,
*  this is the only TV show where I'm like,
*  I don't understand how they pulled this off.
*  There's many things about that are just sort of,
*  it is incredible.
*  Okay, so Tony, in order for this to work
*  and for him to have this position
*  and be in the position he's in,
*  he's always kind of got to be the smartest person
*  in the room, okay?
*  And he usually is, particularly if it's any situation
*  where he's dealing with the business of being
*  an organized crime leader.
*  But he's often wrong about other aspects of life,
*  but he can't, it's hard for him.
*  It's like he's the smartest person in the world
*  in the room, and then sometimes he's not,
*  but he can't accept that in a sense.
*  He's got to believe he still is.
*  Right, rational confidence.
*  Yeah, well, not, but for him,
*  it would be rational confidence, right?
*  Because in situations where he's got to deal
*  with the life or death, money or nothing situations,
*  he's really good.
*  He's a good negotiator and all that stuff.
*  It's the things that are less,
*  like less, you know, like trying to undo,
*  like he has a really intense theory of mind,
*  but like a weird kind of sense of empathy,
*  you know what I'm saying?
*  Well, so the last season, there's two episodes,
*  well, actually the end of the season before,
*  after he gets shot, which is like,
*  if you're watching real time, when it's like
*  week after week, Tony's recovering,
*  it was like a long month on that show.
*  I don't think that's like the first part of that season
*  is not finally remembered, but it's super important
*  because it leads to that episode when he's coming back,
*  he's healthy, but he's not 100% healthy,
*  and physically he's diminished, right?
*  And the two big episodes of the physically diminished Tony
*  are the episode he's got that big, strong driver,
*  the guy that drives around, the young guy, he's ripped.
*  He looks like Vin Diesel.
*  And Tony can kind of sense that his crew
*  feels like he's physically vulnerable.
*  So he starts a fight with that guy and beats him up, right?
*  Cause he has to kind of prove to his crew
*  that he can still be the guy, he can be the physical.
*  So then the other one is the Bobby Bockela fight.
*  Bobby Bockela, oh, he's super drunk.
*  Bobby Bockela beats him in the fight,
*  and he can't let it go.
*  He's gotta make Bobby do the one thing Bobby never did,
*  which is just to kill somebody for the family
*  because he has to win that one thing over him.
*  And what you realize is when we say Tony's a bad guy,
*  it's like, oh yeah, cause he killed people who's a mobster.
*  He's actually way worse than that because he's all about,
*  how can I win over the other people in my life?
*  How can I tilt this against them?
*  How can I always stay in power?
*  How can I fuck with them?
*  That's what drives him ultimately.
*  When he fights Bobby out by the lake and all that stuff,
*  his crew is not around.
*  It's really just his wife and his sister.
*  He's talking to Carmella, he's like,
*  you know that if I was younger,
*  it's like she doesn't care at all.
*  She's like, I wish this wouldn't have happened.
*  Why are you trying to convince me you won this fight?
*  You shouldn't be fighting your friend.
*  Who invited this out here?
*  But it's like his own self-knowledge
*  that the other fight is because he's trying to prove it
*  to his crew and this one he's trying to prove to himself.
*  Same episode, another example why he's a bad person.
*  So Janice is happy, right?
*  His sister who he kind of has this love hate,
*  mostly hate relationship with,
*  but she found Bobby, nice guy, they have this lake house.
*  Things are going well and they're at dinner
*  and she seems a little too happy.
*  And he's just like, I gotta undermine this.
*  And that's when he starts making the jokes
*  about how she used to blow guys up.
*  No, they're playing Monopoly.
*  Yeah, and he's just like, you know what?
*  She's feeling herself.
*  I have to bring her back down.
*  And he just figures out a way to do it.
*  But that's what he does.
*  Like he's really mean.
*  Like that remember when conversation with Polly Walnuts
*  where he just like remember when's the worst form
*  of conversation gets up and leaves.
*  Polly Walnuts is pretty loyal guy to him
*  who treats like shit half the time,
*  but everyone around him, he just can't,
*  he has to treat them like shit
*  as a way to have something over them.
*  Which is why when you rewatch the show,
*  there's so many examples of how he does it.
*  And he's way better at it in the second half
*  of the series than the first half.
*  First half, he's still feeling himself out.
*  He's not sure if he's gonna be the mob boss yet.
*  But by the time we get to season three, he's like a monster.
*  I mean, like what you said is that's a very key point
*  because he often mentions how he doesn't like people
*  reminiscing about the past.
*  He hates nostalgia, right?
*  And the reason he hates nostalgia is because he feels
*  that talking about the past means the past is over.
*  And he thinks the past should still be the present.
*  The way things were when he was growing up
*  seeing other people, like that's how it should still be.
*  So he doesn't want people to reminisce
*  because that distances it from the possibility
*  that that's how the world's still that way.
*  And I mean, that's like the kind of idea
*  you can get in a novel.
*  It is very difficult to reflect that
*  through dialogue on a television show.
*  And they do a lot of things like that.
*  Like they have a lot of like the,
*  I guess the word they always use now is the interiority.
*  They're able to sort of get inside these people's
*  very complex feelings about life
*  without showing a lot of it.
*  Polly and like his relationship with his mom, for example.
*  Like that shows us something, you know,
*  his desire to make his mom happy
*  because he sort of thinks that like that
*  he doesn't have a family, so he's gotta do this.
*  He's gotta do this for his mom, you know?
*  Or just like how to,
*  like navigating Meadow's relationships and stuff for Tony.
*  It's like these are things that like don't,
*  they're not just plot points.
*  Like they're not,
*  cause a lot of times a lot of things don't happen.
*  Or that Carmella-Furio thing.
*  Like nothing really happens between them.
*  But there is a lot of pathos in that relationship
*  from both sides.
*  And like just, she is so good as an actress
*  of illustrating the feeling of desperate hopelessness.
*  That like there's just nothing I can do
*  that this is how my life is.
*  And under all these things I want, and they seem simple.
*  They seem like simple things I want,
*  but I know I can't have them.
*  So I gotta convince myself it's okay.
*  And then every once in a while it's not,
*  and she just cracks.
*  Well, and that's the other thing with rewatches,
*  cause you're watching these all in a row
*  at a much faster pace.
*  And Carmella is one of the great female TV characters ever.
*  The way he builds her from season one, what she is,
*  which she's basically like,
*  it's a time where the scutch for Tony.
*  Like she's just busting his balls the whole first season.
*  And it doesn't seem that happy to be married to him,
*  but she's happy with the life that she has.
*  But it doesn't seem like she likes him that much.
*  Then as it evolves,
*  and you start, she starts having that moment
*  where it's like,
*  what is my life?
*  My kid, I spent 15 years trying to raise these two kids.
*  Now my daughter hates me.
*  My son's in his room all the time.
*  I have this husband, this is like this,
*  he's going fucking his goomars all over the place.
*  What do I have?
*  And then every once in a while,
*  he brings me home this necklace.
*  Like, is there something else out here?
*  And that's what season three and season four is about.
*  He's just, it's furio just coming over
*  and being in the doorway for three minutes
*  is like the most exciting moment of her day.
*  Her daughter doesn't respect her.
*  And then how that evolves over the whole course
*  of the series is, I mean, the Whitecaps episode
*  is the famous episode.
*  And that's like one of the great combo acting thing.
*  That's another thing with the show is
*  the acting of Edie Falco as Carmela
*  and then Gaye Nelfini as Soprano,
*  it has to be two of the best 10 TV performances ever.
*  I mean, maybe even top five, six, or seven.
*  Like Gaye Nelfini, you watch this,
*  he's so incredible as an actor.
*  I really feel like it's one of the great achievements
*  that I've seen.
*  Well, it's like the perfect role for him.
*  Like, I mean, I like, it's not,
*  not to say that he's not a great actor,
*  but it's like, it's just, that is one situation where,
*  you know, when you watch that documentary
*  and they show some of the other people
*  who tried out for these parts,
*  it seems like it only could have worked one way.
*  It had to be this way.
*  Right.
*  Like he was the only guy who could have done this.
*  He was the only guy who could have done this.
*  And who would have done it like this effectively, you know?
*  And it's, I, it, it, you know,
*  I remember writing for Grantlin or whatever,
*  like talking about this, Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Wire.
*  And I, at the time, you know, it was like,
*  I kind of concluded that maybe The Wire was actually,
*  or no, that Breaking Bad was the best of these, you know?
*  And, you know, it actually kind of ties back
*  to the thing we were talking about,
*  like the NBA and TikTok and stuff like that.
*  Like in the moment of these things happening,
*  you can kind of have a feeling,
*  but then as time passes, it changes.
*  And the only people who really care are the ones who decide.
*  And I do think maybe the decision is going to be
*  that actually of those four shows,
*  it really was The Sopranos that was the best one.
*  All the other ones in some way are like a version
*  of what that show did.
*  Yeah, I agree with that.
*  You know, that, that, that, that-
*  I think The Wire has the best case
*  because of what it was about.
*  And I think it's aged really well.
*  Van Lathan, I talk about this a lot about,
*  because he, I think he's in The Sopranos camp,
*  just for like what's going to have the longest tail.
*  I feel like The Sopranos is a show that's 50 years from now
*  is still going to hit the same way
*  because of the themes that it's about.
*  It became timeless in a really unusual way.
*  Like you think about the first couple of years of the show,
*  there's, you know, there's the cell phones they're using
*  and you know, there's later on,
*  like AJ's on the internet a lot and Tony's like,
*  what the fuck is he doing?
*  He's just watching a video on the internet and laughing.
*  I like, he's like complete disdain for him.
*  And that's basically, you know, what society is now.
*  Yeah, but, but I, the thing is you can make cases
*  for all four of the shows.
*  That's what, like they were all,
*  it's not a detr, it doesn't detract from any of them
*  to say this.
*  I just, it does like, and, and you know,
*  this kind of story does seem to hold up.
*  I mean, it's like, Goodfellas holds up pretty well.
*  The Godfather holds up very well.
*  It's like, for some reason, this particular thing,
*  like the Italian organized crime world,
*  it has a, it's, it's, it's,
*  Well, there's one other piece,
*  which is why I think all those things have in common,
*  is that some of the shit's super funny.
*  Yes.
*  Like Pauly Walnuts, as the show goes along,
*  Pauly Walnuts really starting with the Pine Barrens episode
*  is one of the funniest characters for me of, of like,
*  I would put him against like shows,
*  like Seinfeld characters.
*  Like he's so fucking good and so funny and like his faces
*  and I just, I, he just makes me laugh.
*  And I think a lot of the people on the show
*  are just like genuinely funny.
*  Yeah, like when Christopher gets out of rehab
*  and Tony's asking him like,
*  and he went through all the 12 steps and he's like,
*  well, not the last one where I kind of, you know,
*  apologized to everyone, make amends.
*  And Tony's like, I don't know if you should do that.
*  You know, and he's like, oh, I agree.
*  So, you know, in some cases, you know, I'll send flowers.
*  In some cases cash.
*  And it's like, it's like, it's not even like set up
*  to be funny, but it's just hilarious that somebody
*  would be like, oh, I've had my heroin addiction
*  has really screwed up these people's lives,
*  but let's not delve too much in them.
*  I'm just gonna give them an envelope of like 20 grand
*  or whatever, I don't know.
*  He's just, he's delivery of those lines is so,
*  it's so perfect.
*  The intervention episode, the five minutes intervention,
*  which was like coming on the heels of what we would have
*  in the eighties and nineties with shows.
*  Like every show would have an intervention episode, right?
*  Like probably the best one was party of five
*  when they intervened with Bailey, Bailey's alcoholism.
*  Really, really good stuff, but obviously a TV show
*  and Chase, Chase is just like,
*  I'm fucking taking this nine other levels.
*  And that becomes one of the funniest five minute sequences
*  in the history of the show.
*  It's just the humor mixed with the fact
*  that these characters are all kind of awful
*  and how they navigated it.
*  Even the episode when Annabelle Sciorra's character,
*  when Tony sends the guy to basically threaten her
*  and be like, you're.
*  Yeah, yes.
*  You've said the sentence you should never say in our world,
*  which is, I'm gonna tell your wife,
*  like not only are you not gonna tell your wife,
*  but you're gonna tell her,
*  and she's like, you're gonna leave this man alone
*  or something horrible is gonna happen.
*  And he's like, it won't be cinematic, right?
*  And scares the shit out of her.
*  We never see her character again.
*  But that last, the last scene of the episode
*  is him bringing groceries back to his family.
*  This guy just was like the most violent, sociopathic,
*  scary dude.
*  And then it's like, hey,
*  did you remember to bring the milk home?
*  Yeah, yeah, he's coming back with his groceries.
*  And I think that's why people like this world
*  because it's like the worst impulses people have,
*  but also things that we care about,
*  family, friendship, loyalty,
*  these things that are like enduring themes.
*  Gandolfini though, to me it's number one.
*  I can't think of a better performance on a TV show.
*  I'm sure other people would argue,
*  but I can't imagine anyone else in the world.
*  And I think he's the biggest reason the show works.
*  He probably true,
*  but I also wonder if I had rewatched a different show,
*  if I might feel differently.
*  That's how it feels to me right now too.
*  It's like the recent, it feels that way.
*  All right, we did it.
*  We made Nephi Kyle's week
*  because he loves nothing more than good sopranos talk.
*  Chuck Kosterman, that was one of our longest pods
*  we've ever had.
*  I really had a good time though.
*  It was good talking to you.
*  Yeah, it was good seeing you.
*  Have a good Thanksgiving.
*  Yeah, have a good Thanksgiving.
*  Are you a big Thanksgiving guy?
*  I love Thanksgiving.
*  I love the football, I love the food.
*  People say like it's my favorite holiday.
*  It might be my favorite day.
*  Especially now when your kids come home
*  and you get to have your whole family together.
*  Like when your kids get older, it's like the best.
*  It's my favorite holiday too.
*  I feel like for the best holiday,
*  you have to say Christmas in the same way
*  like you have to say like the Beatles or Citizen Kane.
*  Like Christmas needs to be the biggest holiday.
*  Some people would go Christmas eat.
*  Yeah, but I think everyone likes Thanksgiving the most.
*  A lot of people do.
*  All right, good to see you.
*  Happy holidays.
*  Bye bye.
