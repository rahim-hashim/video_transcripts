# Should the Warriors Get Jimmy Butler? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ)
*  So we talked about Jimmy Butler before and it seems like Golden State, we're taping this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=0.0s)]
*  It's six o'clock Pacific time right now, Thursday. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=4.88s)]
*  Seems like Golden State is going to be the team if there's a move, unless there's some [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=9.28s)]
*  surprise out of nowhere team. And I was looking at impossible trades. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  And I think Wiggins has to be in it because there's got to be some sort of fat salary and [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=17.84s)]
*  it's either Wiggins or Draymond. I just don't think they're going to trade Draymond. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=23.2s)]
*  He just, I just think that's Steph, that's Steph's guy. That's just like, he's, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=26.72s)]
*  he's over here. You can't touch him, but it would have to be Wiggins. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=32.239999999999995s)]
*  I think it has to be Schroeder because he's an expiring. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=35.76s)]
*  And then there's a Kaminga piece to it where Kaminga, if Golden State doesn't want to pay him. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=39.68s)]
*  And it could potentially be Wiggins, Kaminga and Schroeder. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  And maybe like whatever else little small thing needs to come in. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=50.08s)]
*  So there's two separate questions here. Is that a lot to give up for a guy who's been unhappy for [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=53.36s)]
*  a year? And then also if you're Miami, you might actually be pretty good down the stretch. If you [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=57.92s)]
*  turn a guy who's not really playing at all into Wiggins, who's looked really good the last couple [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=64.4s)]
*  weeks and most of the season, Kaminga coming off the bench and then Schroeder at point guard. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=68.8s)]
*  It's a lot. I just think it's a lot. I think Jonathan Kaminga could be the next Butler. Who [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=74.32s)]
*  knows? I think he's just that good. I just think he's raw still. I think he sometimes [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=79.52s)]
*  gets out of character of what he is at this present moment. But would you pay him? Because [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=85.36s)]
*  you're going to have to pay him next summer. So what's he worth? I think he's that good, man. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=90.64s)]
*  I do. I think from the look, think about it from how he's had to evolve as a player, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  like with Steph and Clay, you know, not you're not taking shots early in the shot clock. You're [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  not trying to dribble it up on the break and be creative. You couldn't do all of that. You can get [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=106.4s)]
*  a little bit of it done now because Clay's not there. But just based on what I've seen from him [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=111.2s)]
*  this year, I just don't think they want to give him up. And if they do, I think it's going to pay [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=116.72s)]
*  a price because Butler's what? I mean, what? Three years, maybe four at the most left. And you got a [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=123.04s)]
*  young player in Kaminga. I think Miami, if they could do that deal, they jump all over that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=128.8s)]
*  But what's the point of keeping Kaminga if you're not going to play him or if you're going to yank [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=134.08s)]
*  him around like Steve Kirstein, like if he does, if you're not going to pay him, yeah, or if you're [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=138.16s)]
*  not going to pay him. And then like the flip side with Wiggins, though, is I wouldn't want Andrew [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=141.76s)]
*  Wiggins if I got to pay him 30 million dollars this year. I got to pay him 30 next year. I got [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=146.56s)]
*  to pay him 30 after after that. If he picks up the option, like I'm not crazy about Andrew Wiggins [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=150.32s)]
*  because to me, he just like, you know, it's the same reputation he had, you know, when he came into [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=154.96s)]
*  the league, he just floats in and out of games outside of the 2022 title run. I mean, Steph [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=159.6s)]
*  doesn't have a number two. And that's the other thing is I like, I don't agree with what's going [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=164.48s)]
*  on, Bill and Phoenix, but at least like, I don't think it's going to work. At least they picked a [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=169.2s)]
*  direction. Like, at least they know what they want to do. Golden States like, all right, well, we [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=174.0s)]
*  want to be in with Kaminga for the future, but we want to be, you know, we want to compete right now [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=178.16s)]
*  with Steph, like either go all in or just blow the thing up and start the rebuild. I don't agree [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  with like, there's no blow up though. They don't. Kerr is the only real trade asset they have. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=188.24s)]
*  You know, I don't know what else, what the other move is. They almost got marketing. They almost [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  got Paul George and they're probably like thanking their lucky stars. Neither of those trades happen [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=197.36s)]
*  because they would have given up everything. They're being fooled right now. I believe that's [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=201.52s)]
*  what it is. I think they beat Oklahoma City and then all of a sudden they think, oh man, all we [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  need to do is just add something. So they have a conundrum right now. And the only reason they're [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=209.04000000000002s)]
*  going to keep winning games like that is because of the coaching of Steve Kerr, because of the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=213.84s)]
*  greatness of Steph Curry. That's why. So they'll beat good teams and you'll start to think, oh, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=218.72s)]
*  okay, maybe, maybe we add somebody. I think it's a mistake. I do. I've said that. I think it's a [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=224.96s)]
*  mistake. I know Curry will never give in to being traded, but I just think it's a mistake. I think [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=230.56s)]
*  their run is over with this group. And, you know, but again, I just think that they're going to win [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=235.6s)]
*  some games, man. They're going to beat some teams and you're going to say, maybe they can do it again [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=242.88s)]
*  because they did it a couple of years ago. So it's not like they don't reach back to something and [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=246.96s)]
*  say, we've done it before. And I think that's part of their problem. Yeah. But the problem is in 2022 [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=252.0s)]
*  when they did it, the league was completely different. I just don't think the league was [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=257.92s)]
*  nearly as good. There was some injury luck with some teams that went sideways and they kind of snuck [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=261.44s)]
*  in. They rode Curry, who I think was at a slightly different point in his career too, in 22 versus [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=266.64s)]
*  now. I think that 22 team would not be able to do that in 25 with how deep the league is and how [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=272.0s)]
*  good it is. I agree. I'm torn on it because, Justin, you remember in the early 90s with the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=278.08s)]
*  Celts when we had the big three and the question was always, how long do we keep these guys? Well, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=285.52s)]
*  we can't trick. We got to keep these guys together. They won titles for us. And the Celts [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=289.68s)]
*  were able to rebuild on the fly a little bit with Reggie Lewis, who was a godsend, Brian Shaw, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=293.68s)]
*  Dee Brown, they had Ed Pinkney, and they had this cool young old thing and it was pretty good. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=299.6s)]
*  They weren't going to win the title, but they were in the mix. They had two really good seasons and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=305.36s)]
*  then Bird and Mikhail Celts just couldn't hold up. I don't even think the Warriors are close to that [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=311.6s)]
*  level. So if I'm them, it's either a question of, do we owe this to Curry because we're never [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=316.24s)]
*  trading him? So if you feel that way, then you got to do the Butler deal and give up whatever [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=324.56s)]
*  and try to hope that you catch Lightning in a bottle with him. Or you got to think about [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=330.88s)]
*  trading Curry and I just don't think they're going to do it. I got a question for you, Bill. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=334.4s)]
*  So say if Golden State had two players in front of them to trade for, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=340.16s)]
*  Derek White or Devin Booker, who do you think they want? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=344.88s)]
*  Well, Devin Booker. He's a better basketball player. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=349.12s)]
*  I saw something where you had Derek White being a better trade chip. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=352.23999999999995s)]
*  No, I had Devin Booker in the top 20. He was not. You saw the wrong thing. See, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=356.23999999999995s)]
*  you get fooled by social media. Go to your Twitter replies. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=360.32s)]
*  Explain to me. Okay. All right. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=364.23999999999995s)]
*  I had Devin Booker in the top 20. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=365.84s)]
*  Of course. Now, back to your other point before Eddie gave you some bad information. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=367.67999999999995s)]
*  Classic fake news from Eddie. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=373.91999999999996s)]
*  Hold up, muscle nose. Put the camera back on Justin Termini. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=375.11999999999995s)]
*  How dare you say that? The only reason I brought it up is because somebody told me that's what was [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=380.32s)]
*  said. That's not what I said. I told you. No, I didn't. I said it was behind Derek White. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=386.88s)]
*  I might as well have just said Bill's a massive moron. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=392.4s)]
*  He said he was behind. You said you were behind a muscle nose. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=394.48s)]
*  Muscle nose. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=398.08s)]
*  I had him number 16. I did have him behind Jalen Williams and Cade Cunningham. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=398.96s)]
*  I did have him behind Evan Mobley and Jaren Jackson. I think that's fair. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=404.32s)]
*  Jalen Williams. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=408.88s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=409.84s)]
*  Do your. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=410.4s)]
*  Well, Jalen Williams is on a rookie contract. Would you rather pay Jalen Williams $9 million a year? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=410.8s)]
*  That's the whole point of a trade asset. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=415.44s)]
*  So it's not about talent. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=416.96s)]
*  No, it's about talent. It's about time of their career. It's about the salary. It's all those [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=418.08s)]
*  things. It's basically you're telling me Phoenix wouldn't rather have Jalen Williams on a rookie [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=423.12s)]
*  contract than Devin Booker for $50 million a year. There's no way. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=427.12s)]
*  Bill, it's the same exact thing between you and Eddie. Sirius thinks you're more talented, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=431.68s)]
*  obviously, but you would cost them more money. So they settle for Eddie because he's making a lot [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=436.0s)]
*  less money. What makes you think that you would be the host and he would be the analyst? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=440.8s)]
*  You see the ego on this crazed animal. He put you in the analyst seat. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=456.64s)]
*  When you're an analyst in this tournament, you can have an ego. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=462.48s)]
*  That's fine. It's the water boys show. It's two water boys. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=464.64000000000004s)]
*  Wait, I'm going to state really quick. Let's say Butler goes back there. Let's say they get a [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=469.12s)]
*  50 cents, 40 cents of the dollar. Let's say it's just Wiggins, Looney and Schroeder and some [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=474.48s)]
*  protected pick. And that's a trade. Miami is like, please take them, give them away. And Butler [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=479.6s)]
*  flips the switch like he's done a couple of times this year to show everybody he still has it. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=484.96000000000004s)]
*  Does that team intrigue you at all? Or is that just the only because I don't make the playoffs? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=489.76s)]
*  Like I know it intrigues me a little bit, but not necessarily just because they're great, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=494.47999999999996s)]
*  just because who in the West is is dominant. Like how much faith do you have in Oklahoma City? As [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=498.56s)]
*  good as they are, we've never seen them win more than one playoff series. Shane Gilder's Alexander [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=503.36s)]
*  still like a young guy who as great as he is, hasn't really given us anything tremendous in [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=507.84s)]
*  the postseason is checking to be healthy. You know, teams with size have beat them up. Dallas [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=512.64s)]
*  has their number. The Lakers, I think, you know, aren't as talented. They match up well. So, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=518.0s)]
*  you know, anything is possible, but I think it's just because of the weakness of the Western [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=522.64s)]
*  Conference. I don't know what you guys think. No, I think the West is wide open. I do. You got your [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=526.16s)]
*  talent at the top, but I think anything can happen. So that's why I think the teams in the West are [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=531.76s)]
*  going to be trying to be aggressive in the following week before the trade deadline to see [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=536.56s)]
*  if they can, you know, get that key player. And Bill, you touched on this with Goldsbury a couple [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=542.32s)]
*  of weeks ago. I don't like, you know, this this topic of like the West being better than the East, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=547.12s)]
*  that is not the case this year. The Eastern Conference is better because the teams at the [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTAtFn7hueQ&t=551.76s)]
