# Playoff Jamal, Playoff (Gulp) Harden, and a Possible Giannis Farewell | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34)
*  Recording this part of the podcast, 9.45 Pacific time, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=0.0s)]
*  I thought the Clippers-Denver game was gonna be a lot better. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=4.04s)]
*  I thought Kirk Goldsberry and I would be talking about all these unbelievable narratives. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Instead, all the narratives came in the first game of the day, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=10.0s)]
*  in the second game of the day, and then the games got worse as they went along. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=13.32s)]
*  But Denver kind of put it on the Clippers tonight, Kirk. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=16.68s)]
*  I did not see this coming. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=20.52s)]
*  I thought Denver was lucky to be 2-2. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=22.52s)]
*  I thought the Clippers were a better team. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=25.2s)]
*  And Jamal Murray became playoff Jamal Murray again tonight. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=27.599999999999998s)]
*  Harden was invisible. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=31.52s)]
*  Where do you want to start? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  What jumped out to you tonight? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=34.72s)]
*  You gotta start with Jamal Murray. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=36.72s)]
*  I mean, that was the game they needed from him in this series, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=38.32s)]
*  in this exact moment. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=41.56s)]
*  It was his best playoff game since the bubble. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=42.96s)]
*  The Clippers looked tired, though. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  The Clippers looked... [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  I don't know if it was elevation or they just hadn't had enough rest, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  but they looked like they were slower to the basketball. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  They looked old. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=56.36s)]
*  And you sort of alluded to it, Bill. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=57.36s)]
*  James Harden did not look very good. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=59.36s)]
*  I think the headlines gotta be Jamal Murray, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=61.36s)]
*  but there is a little bit of an underwhelming current [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=64.36s)]
*  from these Los Angeles Clippers to me. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=67.36s)]
*  Well, if you said before the game, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=69.36s)]
*  Jamal Murray's gonna have his best game of the playoffs [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=71.36s)]
*  and his best game in a while. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=75.36s)]
*  And also Russell Westbrook's gonna come off the bench [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=77.36s)]
*  and score 21 points in 23 minutes, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=80.36s)]
*  I would have said, uh-oh, the Clippers are in trouble. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=82.36s)]
*  But I'm with you. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=85.44s)]
*  They look slow to the ball. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=86.44s)]
*  There was a moment in the fourth quarter [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=88.44s)]
*  for about four or five minutes [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=90.44s)]
*  where they looked like they did earlier in the series, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=91.44s)]
*  but other than that, uh... [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=93.44s)]
*  The Harden thing is just dumbfounding. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=95.44s)]
*  I can't, you know, he's now in his mid-30s. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=98.44s)]
*  He was in the 2008 draft, 2009 draft, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=101.44s)]
*  I can't even remember, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=104.44s)]
*  and it's just been such a huge part of his resume, his career. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=105.44s)]
*  How we're gonna remember him 30 years from now [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=110.44s)]
*  is like this amazing player, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=112.52s)]
*  and just over and over again, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=114.52s)]
*  it wasn't quite there in the playoffs. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=115.52s)]
*  They really needed a big James Harden game [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=117.52s)]
*  either last game or this game. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=120.52s)]
*  One of those two. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=122.52s)]
*  Does he have it in him anymore? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=123.52s)]
*  Maybe, are we expecting too much? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=125.52s)]
*  Because I voted for him for third team all-MBA this year. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=127.52s)]
*  I thought maybe, you know, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=130.52s)]
*  one of the first five games he could own. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=132.52s)]
*  I guess not. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=135.52s)]
*  Yeah, three of nine tonight. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=136.52s)]
*  I mean, players that shot more than him. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=138.52s)]
*  Zubac had 15 shots, Kawhi had 15 shots, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=140.60000000000002s)]
*  Norman Powell had 12 shots, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=143.60000000000002s)]
*  Bogdanovich had 11 shots, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=145.60000000000002s)]
*  three of nine, Bill, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  and then, okay, maybe he's getting it done with the Dimes. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=148.60000000000002s)]
*  No, barely had five assists. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  A lot of those were later in the game. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  I was just... [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  No, I'm ready to say if it's a big game, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=156.60000000000002s)]
*  like a game five in a big series like this, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  I just... [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=161.60000000000002s)]
*  I'm almost more expecting of this kind of performance [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=162.60000000000002s)]
*  from him at this point, which is just sad. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=165.60000000000002s)]
*  So I don't think we're ever gonna see it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=166.60000000000002s)]
*  Now, maybe he... [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=168.68s)]
*  We get another chance here in game six or game seven, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=169.68s)]
*  and he tells me, I'm wrong with a performance [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=172.68s)]
*  that just turns back the clock, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=174.68s)]
*  but this was just a complete no-show [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=176.68s)]
*  from a guy who's had a bunch of no-shows [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=179.68s)]
*  over the last 10 years in big moments like this. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=182.68s)]
*  Yeah, I did a rare tweet. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=185.68s)]
*  I tweeted that they had him guarding Jokic [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=187.68s)]
*  in the second half, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=189.68s)]
*  so we could remember that he was in the game, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=190.68s)]
*  because it was too hard to tell. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=192.68s)]
*  They're built so that they could serve [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=195.68s)]
*  so that they could survive kind of an offensive [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  no-show game from Harden. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  The problem for them was Denver. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  Denver went up a notch. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=204.76000000000002s)]
*  They kind of stayed the same. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  Denver got Westbrook back, which was huge for them, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=208.76000000000002s)]
*  because that was just 23 extra minutes from a bench guy. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=210.76000000000002s)]
*  They played Jordan a little bit more. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  I'm with you. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  Maybe the elevation going against an older team [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  helped a tiny bit. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  But then, you know, I start thinking about [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  some of the stuff I used to write about [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=224.76000000000002s)]
*  back when my fingers worked. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=226.84s)]
*  This is a Quippers team that has just been snake-bitten [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=228.84s)]
*  really since they moved to Southern California. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=231.84s)]
*  That loss they had, game four, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=234.84s)]
*  where they fought all the way back [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=237.84s)]
*  and then they lose on an alley-oop [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=238.84s)]
*  where the ball seemed like it was touching [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=240.84s)]
*  the tip of Aaron Gordon's fingers [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=242.84s)]
*  and it ends up counting because they couldn't overrule it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=244.84s)]
*  That loss was so devastating. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=246.84s)]
*  I'm watching the game tonight. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=248.84s)]
*  I'm like, man, maybe that beat the fight out of them [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=250.84s)]
*  a little bit. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=254.84s)]
*  This is a team that was supposed to be [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  one of the best defenses in the playoffs. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=257.92s)]
*  One of the best defensive rebounding teams [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=259.92s)]
*  in the playoffs. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=261.92s)]
*  The stat that I kept going back to is [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=262.92s)]
*  I think they ranked first in defensive rebounding percentage [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=264.92s)]
*  all year long. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=266.92s)]
*  And then in this playoffs, they ranked 15 out of 16 [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=268.92s)]
*  in that category. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=270.92s)]
*  Some of that is because of Jokic. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=272.92s)]
*  But this is also a defense when Jamal Murray gets going. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=274.92s)]
*  You'd think Kawhi Leonard or Chris Dunn [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=277.92s)]
*  or some combination of Tylue schemes could do it [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=280.92s)]
*  and they just didn't have the fight tonight at all. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=284.0s)]
*  And I don't know what... [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=287.0s)]
*  How many points did the Clippers end up with? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=288.0s)]
*  131, Bill Simmons. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=290.0s)]
*  The Nuggets. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=292.0s)]
*  Yeah, sorry. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=293.0s)]
*  The Nuggets ended up with 131, Bill. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=294.0s)]
*  And that's just, to me, that's a dumb guy stat, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=296.0s)]
*  but that's what you need to know. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=299.0s)]
*  You're not going to win a lot of playoff games [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=300.0s)]
*  if you give up 131 points. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=302.0s)]
*  So this is a proud defense that just laid an egg tonight. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=304.0s)]
*  Yeah, and you think big picture with the Clippers. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=307.0s)]
*  It's never easy with them in a playoff series [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=310.0s)]
*  in the history of their franchise [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=313.08s)]
*  since they moved to Southern California. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=315.08s)]
*  They've never won a playoff series [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=316.08s)]
*  in four or five games, ever. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=318.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=320.08s)]
*  Like, think about how impossible that is. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=321.08s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=323.08s)]
*  They had the 2021 where Kawhi is averaging 30 a game [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=324.08s)]
*  and looking like one of the best guys in the league. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=328.08s)]
*  He gets hurt. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=331.08s)]
*  They end up losing the Western Finals. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=332.08s)]
*  The only time they ever made it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=334.08s)]
*  They blew the 3-1 lead to Denver in 2020. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=335.08s)]
*  They blew that 19-point lead to the Rockets in 2015 [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=338.08s)]
*  when they had a chance to close and go to the West Finals. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  They blew that OKC series in 2014 [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=345.15999999999997s)]
*  when Chris Paul, the point guard, just completely fell apart [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  in game five when they could have had a lead. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=351.15999999999997s)]
*  Coming back to Clippers, they had that 2006 against the Suns [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  when they put in Daniel Ewing [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=359.15999999999997s)]
*  and he fouled Raja Bell on a three [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  and the Suns ended up winning an OT. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=362.15999999999997s)]
*  This is just the legacy of this team [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=365.15999999999997s)]
*  and if you talk to any of their fans, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=367.15999999999997s)]
*  it's almost a little like Junior Red Sox itch before 2004. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=369.24s)]
*  They build the hopes up. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=374.24s)]
*  They convince themselves this is the year [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=375.24s)]
*  and then they get kicked in the nuts. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=377.24s)]
*  I still think they can win game six. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=379.24s)]
*  What's a little scary is that Jokic didn't put a lot of miles [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=381.24s)]
*  on himself tonight. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=384.24s)]
*  Murray carried everything. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=385.24s)]
*  Westbrook carried some. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=386.24s)]
*  They were able to arrest him [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=387.24s)]
*  and he could just snap his fingers in game six [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=389.24s)]
*  and dominate them like he did in game four. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=391.24s)]
*  It's looking bleak for the Clippers. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=393.24s)]
*  I might have been wrong on this series, Kirk. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=395.24s)]
*  I'm bummed. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=397.24s)]
*  I was wrong too. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=398.32s)]
*  I remember, but I was like very scared [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=399.32s)]
*  coming into the playoffs [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=402.32s)]
*  because I was like looking at this Clippers team. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=403.32s)]
*  They have that history you just mentioned [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=405.32s)]
*  but then they have James Harden, Kawhi Leonard [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=408.32s)]
*  and Ben Simmons who by the way, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=411.32s)]
*  Yeah, enough. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=413.32s)]
*  What a beautiful shot tonight. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=414.32s)]
*  He got to the just inside the paint. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=416.32s)]
*  He rises up for that little half hook [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=420.32s)]
*  and he almost hit the rim. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=422.32s)]
*  God bless him. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=423.32s)]
*  It was to the left of the basket. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=424.32s)]
*  He shot it at 1030 at night on a clock. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=426.4s)]
*  It just was diagonal to the left. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=429.4s)]
*  It was rough. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=431.4s)]
*  But on Verno's podcast like three weeks ago [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=432.4s)]
*  when all the trends that I look at [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=435.4s)]
*  throughout the year are pointing to the Clippers [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=437.4s)]
*  are the best analytic team closing the season. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=439.4s)]
*  And I said to Verno, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=443.4s)]
*  Except they're the Clippers. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=444.4s)]
*  Except they're the Clippers. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=445.4s)]
*  And I was like, I'm not going to know what to do. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=446.4s)]
*  I picked them to win this series in seven games too. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=448.4s)]
*  I now would, I wish I could switch [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=451.4s)]
*  it. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=454.47999999999996s)]
*  They just, they just haven't been there. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=455.47999999999996s)]
*  And I think they could win game six, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=457.47999999999996s)]
*  but I just didn't unless they completely reinvent themselves [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=459.47999999999996s)]
*  for a game seven. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=463.47999999999996s)]
*  What we saw in Denver tonight, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=464.47999999999996s)]
*  it's not going to get it done. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=465.47999999999996s)]
*  Obviously. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=466.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean, the counters, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=467.47999999999996s)]
*  they have been there. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=468.47999999999996s)]
*  Kawhi has been the finals MVP in two different cities. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=469.47999999999996s)]
*  Harden has been in the playoffs for his entire career. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=472.47999999999996s)]
*  Derek Jones is in the finals last year. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=475.47999999999996s)]
*  Norm Pals has been in big playoff games. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=478.47999999999996s)]
*  Tai Lu coached in the finals a bunch of times. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=480.47999999999996s)]
*  Van Gundy was in big games. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=482.56s)]
*  Derek Jones was in the finals last year. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=483.56s)]
*  This is about as experienced of a random team [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=485.56s)]
*  as you're going to get. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=488.56s)]
*  They don't have the best part in the series, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=489.56s)]
*  which is a problem. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=491.56s)]
*  And they're just trying everything possible [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=492.56s)]
*  to mess with them. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=494.56s)]
*  But I think the best thing that happened to the Nuggets [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=495.56s)]
*  in this series, other than Jamal Murray, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=499.56s)]
*  seems to be getting better as it's going along. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=501.56s)]
*  Christian Brown's doing, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=503.56s)]
*  it really seems like he's in Harden's head a little bit. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=505.56s)]
*  He just seems to be getting better. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=508.56s)]
*  He just, he's low to the ground [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=511.64s)]
*  and seems to have a sense of that herky-jerky style [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=513.64s)]
*  that Harden has. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=516.64s)]
*  And he's kind of, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=517.64s)]
*  he's doing the defensive herky-jerky version of it. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=518.64s)]
*  And he's moving back and forth with it. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=520.64s)]
*  And I think Harden's just have a lot of trouble going by him. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=522.64s)]
*  In game four, in the fourth quarter, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=525.64s)]
*  I think because Brown was tired, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=528.64s)]
*  Harden started going by him in the fourth quarter. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=529.64s)]
*  But I think it might've been tired legs more than anything. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=531.64s)]
*  But Brown seems really confident against him. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=533.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think if we say there's Harden, Leonard in one corner [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=535.64s)]
*  and then you have Yoko Shimeru in the other corner, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=539.72s)]
*  the second tier guys, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=541.72s)]
*  the Brown and Aaron Gordon obviously have been great. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=543.72s)]
*  Those like guy number three and guy number four, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=547.72s)]
*  those have been the Nuggets guys that have gone. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=551.72s)]
*  Christian Brown hit that huge three, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=554.72s)]
*  I thought, to end the third quarter in this game, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=556.72s)]
*  which really set the tone. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=559.72s)]
*  He's really an emotional leader. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=560.72s)]
*  That's sort of a big thing for him. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=562.72s)]
*  And you mentioned earlier, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=564.72s)]
*  Russell Westbrook getting a performance like that [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=565.72s)]
*  too is just a huge gift. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=568.8000000000001s)]
*  And another reason they put him over the top tonight. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=570.8000000000001s)]
*  Did Denver watching them these last five games [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=573.8000000000001s)]
*  and especially game four, game five, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=577.8000000000001s)]
*  did it change your opinion at all [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=579.8000000000001s)]
*  about whether they could actually throw some haymakers at OKC? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=581.8000000000001s)]
*  The defense is still a big red flag to me. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=585.8000000000001s)]
*  The defense is, I don't know if they're going to keep up [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=589.8000000000001s)]
*  with the Oklahoma City Thunder [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=592.8000000000001s)]
*  if they play them in the next round. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=594.8000000000001s)]
*  I still think that's their Achilles heel. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=596.88s)]
*  I don't think they'll be able to hold up [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=599.88s)]
*  on that end of the court against that young, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=601.88s)]
*  ferocious, deep team with so much rest [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=603.88s)]
*  and so much energy coming into that series. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=607.88s)]
*  So they've won me over with this starting five, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=609.88s)]
*  the Murray Jokic Porter, who has come around in this series. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=614.88s)]
*  It feels like he's- [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=618.88s)]
*  Again, after a game one no show. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=619.88s)]
*  Yeah, and getting called out kind of, I mean, by the Joker. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=621.88s)]
*  But that starting group, I think, can hang [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=625.96s)]
*  where I have trouble, Bill, is below that line [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=628.96s)]
*  where the Thunder are just, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=631.96s)]
*  they almost have a second starting five [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=633.96s)]
*  and this team has Russell Westbrook and DeAndre Jordan. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=636.96s)]
*  OKC versus Denver, if that's what we end up with. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=643.96s)]
*  It's an MVP battle too, which is always fun. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=647.96s)]
*  Oh, that's great. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=650.96s)]
*  And it's a big Hartenstein test. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=651.96s)]
*  That's why they got that guy. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=654.0400000000001s)]
*  Wow, and also Denver got rid of Hartenstein. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=655.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=658.0400000000001s)]
*  James Harden, man. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=659.0400000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=660.0400000000001s)]
*  I had a couple of people in my life [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=661.0400000000001s)]
*  who were like, why is he so high on the Quippers? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=663.0400000000001s)]
*  They have James Harden. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=665.0400000000001s)]
*  I'm like, no, James Harden was good this year. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=666.0400000000001s)]
*  It's like, yeah, he's James Harden. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=668.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's different, dude. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=670.0400000000001s)]
*  It's like, no, no, no, no. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=673.0400000000001s)]
*  I'm the one for Kim Kardashian. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=674.0400000000001s)]
*  She told me, this is it. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=676.0400000000001s)]
*  It's going to work out this time for her. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=677.0400000000001s)]
*  She's going to live happily ever after. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=679.0400000000001s)]
*  We'll see what happens Thursday night. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=682.12s)]
*  I'm going. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=685.12s)]
*  The crowd will be great. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=686.12s)]
*  We're due for, if you had to pick a seven game series [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=687.12s)]
*  out of the available choices, which are probably this one, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=690.12s)]
*  Golden State Houston, even though Golden State's up 3-1, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=693.12s)]
*  Minnesota, and the Lakers, which will be 3-2 after tomorrow [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=696.12s)]
*  when the Lakers shoot 68 free throws, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=700.12s)]
*  or Detroit versus the Knicks. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=703.12s)]
*  Who would you go for a seven gamer? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=705.12s)]
*  Because we're getting one. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=707.12s)]
*  That's just the rule. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=708.12s)]
*  I feel like Detroit needs, they need to win one of these games. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=709.2s)]
*  They had a tough weekend back home in Michigan. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=713.2s)]
*  I think they're going to win game six back at Little Caesars. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=716.2s)]
*  Want to talk about that game? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=720.2s)]
*  Yeah, I thought it was a great game. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=723.2s)]
*  You know, New York is fortunate that there wasn't a late foul [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=725.2s)]
*  call at the end of Sunday's game. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=730.2s)]
*  Yes, they were. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=733.2s)]
*  But they've been playing with fire in this series [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=734.2s)]
*  and they've been getting away with it. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=737.2s)]
*  I think they had a poorly timed injury here [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=738.2800000000001s)]
*  at the end of this game. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=741.2800000000001s)]
*  But the Pistons have been ahead, Bill, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=742.2800000000001s)]
*  in every fourth quarter of the series. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=746.2800000000001s)]
*  I think in game one, they weren't ready for the smoke [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=748.2800000000001s)]
*  of the moment. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=751.2800000000001s)]
*  But since then, these games all could have gone either way [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=753.2800000000001s)]
*  to an extent. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=758.2800000000001s)]
*  And I think tonight, Kate Cunningham, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=759.2800000000001s)]
*  they played better pick and roll offense [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=764.2800000000001s)]
*  than the New York Knicks. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=766.36s)]
*  And they took it to them. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=769.36s)]
*  And I'm not shocked, but I was impressed. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=771.36s)]
*  25-10-10 for Kate. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=775.36s)]
*  Seven turnovers. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=777.36s)]
*  It's been an extra three turnovers a game for him [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=779.36s)]
*  because he has the ball so much. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=781.36s)]
*  But the stat that jumped out to me, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=783.36s)]
*  Detroit, 7-29 from three, and they went on the road. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=786.36s)]
*  That's really hard to do. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=789.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=791.36s)]
*  The Knicks, 15 for 33 from three. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=792.44s)]
*  So they were plus eight on threes. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=801.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=803.44s)]
*  And they lost at home. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=804.44s)]
*  But the key to this game, so Detroit, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=806.44s)]
*  they shoot eight for 29 from three. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=808.44s)]
*  No surprise. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=810.44s)]
*  Not exactly. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=811.44s)]
*  Beasley's not going. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=812.44s)]
*  Not exactly like an awesome 3.2. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=813.44s)]
*  But the Knicks, nine for 25 from three. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=815.44s)]
*  Right? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=819.44s)]
*  So red flag number one. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=820.5200000000001s)]
*  Red flag number two, Brunson, four for 16. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=822.5200000000001s)]
*  And it's hard to tell how hurt he is. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=826.5200000000001s)]
*  Sometimes you can do, like he got hurt in game four [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=828.5200000000001s)]
*  and he came back and you get the adrenaline [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=831.5200000000001s)]
*  20 minutes before your ankle starts to feel even worse [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=833.5200000000001s)]
*  than it did. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=836.5200000000001s)]
*  He definitely looked hobbled around. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=837.5200000000001s)]
*  He goes out at some point, probably like what, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=839.5200000000001s)]
*  three, four minutes left in the fourth quarter. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=841.5200000000001s)]
*  Then Tibbs has a chance to put him and Hart back in [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=843.5200000000001s)]
*  and doesn't use his last time out. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=847.5200000000001s)]
*  He's standing there for a minute and a half. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=849.6s)]
*  One of many bizarre Tibbs coaching decisions. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=851.6s)]
*  But what you said before about the quarters, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=853.6s)]
*  this series has been even for a week and a half. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=857.6s)]
*  And Detroit, they take the leads early in these games [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=860.6s)]
*  or they're close. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=864.6s)]
*  They hold. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=865.6s)]
*  They're never having really swoons. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=866.6s)]
*  Their defense and their rebounding's always been able [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=868.6s)]
*  to keep them around. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=870.6s)]
*  And Cade's been the most consistently good player [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=871.6s)]
*  in the series. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=874.6s)]
*  If I'm a Knicks fan now, I'm just putting miles, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=875.6800000000001s)]
*  even if I get through the series, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=879.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm just putting miles on my guys [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=880.6800000000001s)]
*  who already seem worn down with the Celtics [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=882.6800000000001s)]
*  just getting rest and waiting. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=884.6800000000001s)]
*  But do you think they, like who do you think wins a game six [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=886.6800000000001s)]
*  between these two teams based on what you've seen? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=890.6800000000001s)]
*  I think it's gonna be a hard task for the Knicks. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=892.6800000000001s)]
*  Detroit played better basketball tonight. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=894.6800000000001s)]
*  I think the play that sealed it for Detroit in my mind, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=896.6800000000001s)]
*  one of the most beautiful passes of the playoffs, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=899.6800000000001s)]
*  but Detroit just picked apart the Knicks [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=901.76s)]
*  in the pick and roll game. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=905.76s)]
*  Jaylen Dern is growing up in front of us. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=907.76s)]
*  He's a monster in person. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=910.76s)]
*  If you haven't seen him, it's just like one of these guys. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=912.76s)]
*  It's just a different size than everybody else. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=914.76s)]
*  One of the great rebounders in these playoffs. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=917.76s)]
*  But I think like there was a pick and roll near the end. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=920.76s)]
*  You know, the Knicks sent two towards Cade [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=924.76s)]
*  who ended up with the right elbow. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=926.76s)]
*  And who was it who snuck into the dunks? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=928.84s)]
*  Asar Thompson, who also played a great game. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=931.84s)]
*  He was awesome today. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=933.84s)]
*  Yeah, cat falls asleep and Cade throws that pass, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=934.84s)]
*  a rocket pass right into the dunker [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=938.84s)]
*  and Asar finishes it. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=940.84s)]
*  And it wasn't quite curtains [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=942.84s)]
*  because the Knicks made some shots. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=944.84s)]
*  But that was just, I think, really emblematic [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=945.84s)]
*  of a bread and butter play [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=947.84s)]
*  where the Cade Cunningham pick and roll with Dern. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=949.84s)]
*  Sometimes it was Paul Reed is just basic basketball [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=954.9200000000001s)]
*  and it looks better, especially with a hobbled Brunson [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=959.9200000000001s)]
*  than what the Knicks were able to counter with. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=963.9200000000001s)]
*  So I think the Pistons have a very good defense. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=965.9200000000001s)]
*  They're very young and motivated to win this game six at home [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=970.9200000000001s)]
*  and the fundamental basketball they're playing right now. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=973.9200000000001s)]
*  And one other thing is like, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=975.9200000000001s)]
*  you talk a lot about tips coaching. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=977.9200000000001s)]
*  I know that. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=978.9200000000001s)]
*  Can we post up Carl Towns on Tobias Harris, please? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=979.9200000000001s)]
*  He just dominates him when they do it. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=984.0s)]
*  It's like they're afraid [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=987.0s)]
*  he's gonna get offensive fouls or something. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=988.0s)]
*  I can't think of another reason. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=990.0s)]
*  I have no idea, but every time they do it, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=992.0s)]
*  it's like there's no answer. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=994.0s)]
*  Tobias Harris has no chance. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=995.0s)]
*  You know my rule, Kurt Goldsberry. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=997.0s)]
*  If you do something [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=999.0s)]
*  and the defense completely overreacts and doubles it [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1001.0s)]
*  because they don't have an answer for it, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1004.0s)]
*  maybe do it again. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1005.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1006.0s)]
*  Give it a whirl. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1007.0s)]
*  That might be a sign that it's something to do. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1008.0s)]
*  Particularly if Jalen Brunson is playing on one foot. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1011.08s)]
*  I don't know what his injury is. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1014.08s)]
*  I'm not speaking out of turn here, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1015.08s)]
*  but if your star is hurt, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1017.08s)]
*  you have this other guy, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1019.08s)]
*  this other bread and butter action, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1020.08s)]
*  you could increase. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1022.08s)]
*  And if it's gonna be Tobias Harris [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1025.08s)]
*  defending Carl Towns on the block, dude, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1027.08s)]
*  make them pay for that. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1030.08s)]
*  Go old school. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1032.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1033.08s)]
*  You know, and I haven't seen enough of that, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1034.08s)]
*  those adjustments from Tibbs. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1036.08s)]
*  I thought the Knicks were gonna win it, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1038.08s)]
*  I thought the Knicks were gonna win in five. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1040.1599999999999s)]
*  It seemed like they were gonna win in five tonight [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1042.1599999999999s)]
*  and then Detroit had other ideas. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1044.1599999999999s)]
*  I just continue to be underwhelmed by the Knicks. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1048.1599999999999s)]
*  And I know now people could say, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1050.1599999999999s)]
*  no, Brunson's hurt. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1052.1599999999999s)]
*  Like, well, everybody on that team plays huge minutes. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1053.1599999999999s)]
*  The more minutes you play, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1057.1599999999999s)]
*  the odds are gonna increase [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1058.1599999999999s)]
*  that you're gonna have an injury. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1059.1599999999999s)]
*  It's just the way it goes. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1061.1599999999999s)]
*  But in general, like, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1063.1599999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1066.1599999999999s)]
*  They did, like, I'm not afraid of them. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1067.1599999999999s)]
*  I said this before the playoffs, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1068.24s)]
*  I'll say it again. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1070.24s)]
*  I was way more afraid of playing Indiana than the Knicks. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1071.24s)]
*  I think Indiana knows who they are. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1073.24s)]
*  I think they have an identity. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1075.24s)]
*  And the Knicks, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1076.24s)]
*  I'm not sure what their identity is. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1077.24s)]
*  It's a lot of Brunson, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1079.24s)]
*  it's a lot of standing around. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1080.24s)]
*  They can have these little spurts. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1082.24s)]
*  Towns can get hot every once in a while. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1083.24s)]
*  Sometimes their wings look awesome. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1085.24s)]
*  Other times, I forget they're out there. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1088.24s)]
*  For all the quote unquote awesome defense [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1091.24s)]
*  that their wings were supposed to bring, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1094.24s)]
*  like, over and over again, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1096.24s)]
*  you see guys get the kind of shots and plays they want, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1097.32s)]
*  like Cade. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1100.32s)]
*  You would think, like, with Bridges, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1101.32s)]
*  and Ananobe, it's like, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1102.32s)]
*  we should be able to shut down Cade, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1103.32s)]
*  or limit him, or whatever. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1104.32s)]
*  And, you know, I don't think that's happened. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1106.32s)]
*  And a lot of it has to do with C.J. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1108.32s)]
*  being able to get the switches he wanted. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1110.32s)]
*  I get it. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1111.32s)]
*  But I just don't, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1112.32s)]
*  the balance of the team just doesn't seem right to me. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1114.32s)]
*  And I've felt that way for a while. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1116.32s)]
*  Yeah, there's two things. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1117.32s)]
*  The interior defense with Towns, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1118.32s)]
*  when they made the Towns deal, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1120.32s)]
*  that was always the red flag to me. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1121.32s)]
*  Are we really gonna see a playoff defense [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1122.32s)]
*  anchored with Carl Anthony Towns? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1125.32s)]
*  And as I said, this key moment, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1126.3999999999999s)]
*  you know, it's not his fault, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1129.3999999999999s)]
*  but that's who you're relying on to be your rim protector. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1130.3999999999999s)]
*  He's not always great at that. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1133.3999999999999s)]
*  And then the other thing is, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1135.3999999999999s)]
*  sometimes the offense looks like crap. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1136.3999999999999s)]
*  And there's multiple possessions and big moments [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1138.3999999999999s)]
*  where it's just Brunson pounding the air out of the ball, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1142.3999999999999s)]
*  and everybody else standing around, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1145.3999999999999s)]
*  and there's either gonna be a foul, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1147.3999999999999s)]
*  or some kind of fade away, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1149.3999999999999s)]
*  and nobody else is gonna touch the basketball. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1150.3999999999999s)]
*  And I hate that. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1152.3999999999999s)]
*  I hate watching it. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1153.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1154.3999999999999s)]
*  And I'm sure the players playing alongside. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1155.48s)]
*  It's just not... [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1157.48s)]
*  I don't think the fans like it either. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1158.48s)]
*  You can feel like there's a weird energy from these Knicks games. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1160.48s)]
*  The crowds were way better last year, I think. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1163.48s)]
*  This year there's a nervous energy, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1165.48s)]
*  and you can feel the frustration. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1166.48s)]
*  It's coming through the TV. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1168.48s)]
*  Yeah, the pick and roll game too. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1169.48s)]
*  It's like they only scored 27 points in the pick and roll game. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1171.48s)]
*  And the Pistons doubled them up in that category. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1174.48s)]
*  Again, Cade Cunningham, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1177.48s)]
*  it's a lot of people's introduction to him. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1179.48s)]
*  But, you know, there's a danger. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1182.48s)]
*  There's a danger. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1184.56s)]
*  Because if they do win in Detroit, look out. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1185.56s)]
*  Look out, Bill. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1187.56s)]
*  If the Pistons win. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1188.56s)]
*  If the Pistons win in Detroit, look out. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1189.56s)]
*  Well, so that game's gonna be when? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1191.56s)]
*  Is that a Thursday game? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1193.56s)]
*  That is... yeah. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1195.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1197.56s)]
*  That's not great for the Knicks, right? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1198.56s)]
*  That's two games later, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1200.56s)]
*  and Brunson's hobbin' around, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1202.56s)]
*  and Hart got hurt at the end of that game, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1203.56s)]
*  and they have no bench to begin with. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1205.56s)]
*  And the Pistons are young. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1207.56s)]
*  That's such an underrated part of this. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1209.56s)]
*  Cleveland getting out in four games, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1211.56s)]
*  and OKC getting... [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1213.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the Celts getting out of there today. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1215.6399999999999s)]
*  The Celts punted on holiday for the series [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1217.6399999999999s)]
*  and kept their fingers crossed that he could get healed [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1219.6399999999999s)]
*  and they got out of it. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1221.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and they just need all the treatment, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1223.6399999999999s)]
*  some cold plunges, you know. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1226.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1228.6399999999999s)]
*  All that rest. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1229.6399999999999s)]
*  And these other teams are gonna be flying back and forth, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1230.6399999999999s)]
*  putting more miles on their bodies, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1232.6399999999999s)]
*  twisting ankles. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1234.6399999999999s)]
*  It's such an underrated part of this. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1235.6399999999999s)]
*  So it was good that Boston emerged relatively unscathed [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1238.6399999999999s)]
*  from that Orlando series. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1242.72s)]
*  Well, I want to talk about that. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1244.72s)]
*  Let's take a quick break and we'll talk Boston-Orlando. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1245.72s)]
*  So Boston-Orlando is expecting a little bit more of a slugfest. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1247.72s)]
*  It was a weird game. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1250.72s)]
*  It was close. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1251.72s)]
*  It was close. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1252.72s)]
*  Palo got in foul trouble. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1253.72s)]
*  And then the Celts went on one of those runs [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1255.72s)]
*  that they had a lot last year. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1257.72s)]
*  They've had them intermittently this year, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1259.72s)]
*  but more on the road than at home, weirdly. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1261.72s)]
*  But they'll just have these third quarters [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1263.72s)]
*  or second quarters, whatever, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1265.72s)]
*  where they'll just go on these like 28-5 runs [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1267.72s)]
*  and guys are hitting threes [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1270.72s)]
*  and they just put the game away in five minutes, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1271.8s)]
*  which is what happened. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1273.8s)]
*  I will say, and I know I talk about Tatum a lot [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1274.8s)]
*  on this podcast and people are probably tired of it, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1277.8s)]
*  but Tatum's just been awesome. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1280.8s)]
*  And there's an edge to him [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1283.8s)]
*  that he just didn't have last year. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1286.8s)]
*  And I think a lot of it comes from Missoula. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1287.8s)]
*  I think Missoula spends a lot of time talking to him, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1289.8s)]
*  talking in his ear, motivating him, pushing him, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1292.8s)]
*  pushing to be bully, pushing to be tougher. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1295.8s)]
*  Even that play when he got knocked down [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1297.8s)]
*  and he got hurt in game two or game one. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1299.8799999999999s)]
*  And Missoula's like, get up, get up. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1302.8799999999999s)]
*  Like he's just constantly trying to make him a beast [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1304.8799999999999s)]
*  and you see it in these games. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1308.8799999999999s)]
*  Like he's carrying himself down. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1310.8799999999999s)]
*  He's got this little half sneer he does sometimes. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1311.8799999999999s)]
*  I just think he's been awesome in these games. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1314.8799999999999s)]
*  Is the new wrist thing that he's doing [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1317.8799999999999s)]
*  related to the injury? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1320.8799999999999s)]
*  Is it like a celebration of overcoming the wrist injury? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1321.8799999999999s)]
*  Is that what he's doing? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1325.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it feels like you try to break my wrist, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1326.8799999999999s)]
*  but it's still here, like one of those type of things. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1328.96s)]
*  But that's new. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1330.96s)]
*  I like that too. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1331.96s)]
*  But the thing is Orlando can't shoot. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1332.96s)]
*  And the over under for them winning a game in this series [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1334.96s)]
*  is probably 0.5. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1339.96s)]
*  They won their game, but they just cannot. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1341.96s)]
*  They can't shoot. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1344.96s)]
*  As it was slippery in the third quarter, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1345.96s)]
*  Franz took a three and it went over the backboard [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1347.96s)]
*  and hit the over the rim and hit the other side [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1351.96s)]
*  of the backboard. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1353.96s)]
*  It was one of those bricks. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1354.96s)]
*  And it was just like, that's it. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1355.96s)]
*  That's the highlight. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1356.96s)]
*  That's the highlight you need to know. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1358.04s)]
*  Eight of 38 from three for the Orlando Magic. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1359.04s)]
*  There's a couple of teams in the playoffs, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1363.04s)]
*  like Houston I think we'd fairly characterize [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1364.04s)]
*  as they're going to have trouble scoring the ball. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1367.04s)]
*  But Orlando is going to definitely have trouble [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1369.04s)]
*  shooting the basketball. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1371.04s)]
*  And then the other thing I like is [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1373.04s)]
*  Orlando does play phenomenal defense. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1374.04s)]
*  And for a long time, the Celtics I think had no threes [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1376.04s)]
*  deep into the second quarter in this game. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1379.04s)]
*  No, they didn't have a three in the first half. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1381.04s)]
*  Yeah, I was trying to go back between these two games [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1384.04s)]
*  and it was pretty incredible. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1386.12s)]
*  So shout out to them. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1388.12s)]
*  They do some good stuff and they force you [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1390.12s)]
*  into these isolation modes. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1392.12s)]
*  And that's where Tatum really shined, I thought. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1394.12s)]
*  And I know sometimes the Celtics are at their worst [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1397.12s)]
*  in those isolation moments, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1399.12s)]
*  but Tatum can get buckets in those moments. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1401.12s)]
*  And they actually, if you look at the advanced stuff tonight, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1405.12s)]
*  they really dominated in that isolation category [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1408.12s)]
*  and duh, that's Jason Tatum. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1411.12s)]
*  But it was 59-58 to your point [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1413.1999999999998s)]
*  with six minutes left in the third quarter. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1416.1999999999998s)]
*  And then I don't know what the final score was. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1419.1999999999998s)]
*  I guess it ends up being 120 to 89. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1421.1999999999998s)]
*  So they were 36 to 13 in the third quarter. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1425.1999999999998s)]
*  You know, I think the Celtics organization [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1429.1999999999998s)]
*  has been really impressed with Orlando [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1432.1999999999998s)]
*  and I think there's a sense of relief [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1434.1999999999998s)]
*  that that team wasn't healthier this year, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1436.1999999999998s)]
*  that that team was probably the third best team [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1439.1999999999998s)]
*  in the East if you just, you know, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1442.28s)]
*  you think like Palo goes down for a while, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1444.28s)]
*  Frans goes down for a while, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1447.28s)]
*  Suggs goes down for 60, 65% of the year, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1448.28s)]
*  but that team is really tough. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1453.28s)]
*  They're not afraid of the Celts. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1455.28s)]
*  They match up on the wings with Brown and Tatum [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1456.28s)]
*  at least physically. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1459.28s)]
*  They rebound. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1460.28s)]
*  They had a couple of playoff guys [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1462.28s)]
*  that weren't afraid to close on you. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1464.28s)]
*  And I think if they just had a healthy team all year, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1466.28s)]
*  I think that team would have been really good. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1469.28s)]
*  And looking forward, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1471.36s)]
*  like we were joking with Sarutti, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1472.36s)]
*  but I got to sign Ty Jerome. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1473.36s)]
*  Bobby Marks had a tweet where he tweeted [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1475.36s)]
*  where they were sitting going into the summer. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1477.36s)]
*  They've kind of paid the piper already [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1480.36s)]
*  with some of their moves. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1482.36s)]
*  They're like over I think 200 million [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1483.36s)]
*  with their salaries right now [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1485.36s)]
*  because Palo already kicked in, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1487.36s)]
*  Frans, you know, they paid KCP. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1489.36s)]
*  You're going down the line, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1493.36s)]
*  like they're spending actual money now [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1494.36s)]
*  and this is kind of the team. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1497.36s)]
*  So their best move is going to be [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1499.36s)]
*  can Suggs come back, be healthy, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1500.4399999999998s)]
*  and then can Anthony Black make a leap, I think. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1501.4399999999998s)]
*  And Frans needs to develop a jump shot [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1504.4399999999998s)]
*  and there's been some aggression there. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1506.4399999999998s)]
*  You mentioned this. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1508.4399999999998s)]
*  There's the hitch in the shot. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1509.4399999999998s)]
*  It's not great, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1511.4399999999998s)]
*  but if they can get healthy, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1513.4399999999998s)]
*  Mo Wagner, Jalen Suggs, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1515.4399999999998s)]
*  you know, I'm not going to put them [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1518.4399999999998s)]
*  in the class of the Celtics or the Cavs, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1519.4399999999998s)]
*  but I like where you have them. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1521.4399999999998s)]
*  It could be Indiana. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1522.4399999999998s)]
*  They could replace Milwaukee [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1523.4399999999998s)]
*  in that three, four, five tier. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1525.4399999999998s)]
*  And they might have been there this year [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1528.52s)]
*  if they had just been healthy. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1530.52s)]
*  You alluded to it. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1531.52s)]
*  They're three best guys, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1532.52s)]
*  all missed significant time [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1533.52s)]
*  and they ended up at the seventh spot [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1535.52s)]
*  and won a game against the champs. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1537.52s)]
*  It's just like the rung on the ladder [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1539.52s)]
*  this organization is at right now. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1542.52s)]
*  And I think they should expect [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1544.52s)]
*  to be a little bit higher next year for sure. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1546.52s)]
*  Well, the Celts definitely respected them [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1548.52s)]
*  because they brought Tatum back. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1550.52s)]
*  They probably should have waited one more game [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1552.52s)]
*  and they felt like they couldn't. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1554.52s)]
*  And then they tried to roll the dice [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1555.52s)]
*  with not playing Drew [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1557.6s)]
*  and hoping he could be healthy for the next series. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1558.6s)]
*  Now he gets more time. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1560.6s)]
*  But with the way the Knicks look, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1561.6s)]
*  that second round series might not be as, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1563.6s)]
*  maybe grueling as you thought. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1566.6s)]
*  The team you wouldn't want to play is Indiana. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1568.6s)]
*  You're confident. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1570.6s)]
*  You're confident. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1572.6s)]
*  I mean, the way the Knicks look, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1573.6s)]
*  the way the Celtics have looked [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1574.6s)]
*  for the last almost two years, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1576.6s)]
*  they have to be pretty heavy favorites [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1578.6s)]
*  to advance to round three. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1582.6s)]
*  Indiana, I think, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1584.6s)]
*  Indiana had an incredible comeback against Milwaukee [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1586.6799999999998s)]
*  that I wasn't surprised by even when they were down seven [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1591.6799999999998s)]
*  with 45 seconds left. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1594.6799999999998s)]
*  I had India in the money line in a bet [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1595.6799999999998s)]
*  and I was like, I'm not giving up. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1597.6799999999998s)]
*  I feel like they might make it three. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1598.6799999999998s)]
*  I didn't expect them to win. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1600.6799999999998s)]
*  I thought maybe they had a chance [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1602.6799999999998s)]
*  to force the other overtime. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1603.6799999999998s)]
*  But Halliburton, and I'm texting, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1605.6799999999998s)]
*  I have a friend who is a big Halliburton person [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1609.6799999999998s)]
*  and I was texting, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1611.6799999999998s)]
*  maybe through the fourth quarter, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1613.6799999999998s)]
*  I'm like, typical fucking Halliburton. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1614.76s)]
*  God forbid he takes over and does anything. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1616.76s)]
*  And then he took over and then some. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1619.76s)]
*  Like down the stretch in the fourth quarter. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1621.76s)]
*  It's almost like he forgets sometimes [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1623.76s)]
*  that he could just go right by people. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1625.76s)]
*  And what was interesting about the end of the fourth quarter [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1627.76s)]
*  in the OT, he went by Giannis. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1630.76s)]
*  He cooked Giannis, I'm going to say three or four times. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1632.76s)]
*  You don't normally see somebody do that to Giannis, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1636.76s)]
*  including for the game winning shot. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1640.76s)]
*  I was stunned. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1642.76s)]
*  Were you surprised by that? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1643.84s)]
*  Yeah, I said out loud, good luck with that [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1644.84s)]
*  for the game winner because he's like, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1647.84s)]
*  he's I sowed on the left wing against Giannis [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1648.84s)]
*  and he's like, I'm going to take this to the rack. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1650.84s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1652.84s)]
*  He did it multiple times. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1653.84s)]
*  Yeah, good luck. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1655.84s)]
*  And he did it. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1656.84s)]
*  And that exact moment, I was surprised. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1657.84s)]
*  We have to go through the seven point lead in 40 seconds. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1660.84s)]
*  So AJ Green misses a free throw. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1662.84s)]
*  Nemhard uses like a Miles Turner screen. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1666.84s)]
*  And Giannis, this is his fault. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1669.84s)]
*  He's in drop coverage. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1671.9199999999998s)]
*  So Nemhard just rises up and choose the 28 footer. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1672.9199999999998s)]
*  Okay, so four foot, four point game, timeout. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1674.9199999999998s)]
*  Here comes the first big blunder, AJ Green inbounds [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1678.9199999999998s)]
*  and Trent gets trapped, anticipates a foul, didn't come [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1682.9199999999998s)]
*  and just throws a bad pass. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1686.9199999999998s)]
*  Nemhard picks it off. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1687.9199999999998s)]
*  Pacers pretty patient. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1689.9199999999998s)]
*  Then we get the first big Halliburton play, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1690.9199999999998s)]
*  the three point play that cuts it to one. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1692.9199999999998s)]
*  Timeout. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1695.9199999999998s)]
*  And then this is one of the most depressing plays in NBA history. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1696.9199999999998s)]
*  The Trent through the legs? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1701.0s)]
*  I don't want to tell you what it reminded me of, Bill, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1704.0s)]
*  because it'll trigger you. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1708.0s)]
*  Yeah, I thought that. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1709.0s)]
*  No, don't worry. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1710.0s)]
*  I thought it. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1711.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1712.0s)]
*  As long as, yeah. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1713.0s)]
*  So, dude. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1714.0s)]
*  I mean, the dude, he hadn't had 30 points all year [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1715.0s)]
*  and he hadn't had eight threes all year [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1718.0s)]
*  and he did it twice in three games. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1719.0s)]
*  Trent, right? [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1721.0s)]
*  He literally carried them down the stretch [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1722.0s)]
*  and then had two boneheaded plays [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1724.0s)]
*  that cost them the season basically. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1726.0s)]
*  Yeah, I did a rare tweet myself. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1728.0s)]
*  I said, you know, overtime score, Indiana eight, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1730.08s)]
*  Gary Trent 12, because it looked like with one minute left [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1732.08s)]
*  in this game, Gary Trent had just saved the Bucs season. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1736.08s)]
*  I feel like we were going to be... [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1740.08s)]
*  He took 25 shots, Kirk. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1741.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1742.08s)]
*  He became the second biggest player in Milwaukee [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1743.08s)]
*  after the game injury. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1746.08s)]
*  And he made huge three after huge three. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1748.08s)]
*  And then these two mammoth turnovers, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1752.08s)]
*  just a cruel, cruel end to their season [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1755.08s)]
*  and potentially, Bill, the Gianna Santa Taccumpo era. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1758.1599999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of interesting stuff [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1763.1599999999999s)]
*  both from watching the game and the box score. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1765.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1767.1599999999999s)]
*  Brooke Lopez, seven minutes, Kyle Kuzma, 12. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1768.1599999999999s)]
*  So, Doc basically bailed on Kuzma [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1771.1599999999999s)]
*  who was somebody they traded Middleton for, beloved Buc, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1774.1599999999999s)]
*  to get under the Sadler cap. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1778.1599999999999s)]
*  They gave up A.J. Johnson, who some NBA people kind of like, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1781.1599999999999s)]
*  and there's some swap. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1784.1599999999999s)]
*  I think in 28 that they gave up as well. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1786.24s)]
*  And it took Doc Rivers about four games [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1789.24s)]
*  to get tired of Kyle Kuzma. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1792.24s)]
*  Giannis leaves a 30-20-13 on the court, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1794.24s)]
*  including 18 defensive rebounds. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1800.24s)]
*  And the game ends with him getting burned by Hal Burton [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1803.24s)]
*  and then taunted by Hal Burton's dad [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1806.24s)]
*  who just looked deranged. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1808.24s)]
*  I didn't understand what was happening. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1810.24s)]
*  And I can't believe Giannis had the restraint [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1811.24s)]
*  but then Giannis is saying good game to Ben Mathurin [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1814.32s)]
*  and now he's doing the Fredo Michael Corleone cup for the head. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1817.32s)]
*  And just look at that. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1821.32s)]
*  Everyone was talking about this 100 guys against a gorilla. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1823.32s)]
*  It seemed like it was going to be a 100 Pacers versus Giannis [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1826.32s)]
*  at one point. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1829.32s)]
*  The Artest Melee too. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1830.32s)]
*  Dude, what happened? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1832.32s)]
*  Yeah, I have no idea where to start [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1834.32s)]
*  with what happened after the game [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1836.32s)]
*  from the Hal Burton dad incident [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1838.32s)]
*  to the Mathurin, the Calabasas, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1841.32s)]
*  to the Mathurin hug that turns into a shove. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1843.3999999999999s)]
*  A hug shove. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1847.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1848.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1849.3999999999999s)]
*  It was very strange. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1850.3999999999999s)]
*  I think Giannis was so mad. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1851.3999999999999s)]
*  And Giannis does a good job in the press conferences [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1852.3999999999999s)]
*  of being like, you know, I try to be humble and blah, blah, blah [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1855.3999999999999s)]
*  but Giannis is a fucking badass, man. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1858.3999999999999s)]
*  He gets mad. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1860.3999999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1861.3999999999999s)]
*  Like the switch can go off with him. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1862.3999999999999s)]
*  I really felt like there was going to be a massive melee [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1864.3999999999999s)]
*  at the end, which would have been bizarre. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1867.3999999999999s)]
*  There's some troubling end of game stuff [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1868.3999999999999s)]
*  where he's a very competitive guy [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1870.3999999999999s)]
*  and he's lost the school. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1872.48s)]
*  Do you remember early in his career [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1873.48s)]
*  he tackled Mike Dunleavy? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1874.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1876.48s)]
*  Remember that other time when he went and grabbed the ball? [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1877.48s)]
*  Was it Mike Dunleavy? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1879.48s)]
*  Yeah, it was Mike Dunleavy Jr. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1880.48s)]
*  That other time when he grabbed the ball from Indiana [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1881.48s)]
*  that served this hole. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1883.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1884.48s)]
*  Yeah, so he gets a little feisty. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1885.48s)]
*  And I was worried. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1887.48s)]
*  And it also evokes and sort of gives the Pacers [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1889.48s)]
*  a little bit of credit and some shine here. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1892.48s)]
*  It evokes like these incredible Reggie Miller moments [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1894.48s)]
*  from that franchise's history where they have, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1896.48s)]
*  oh my God, what? [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1899.48s)]
*  So they just got another one of these like, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1900.56s)]
*  what was, you did the 30 for 30. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1902.56s)]
*  Was it 8.9 seconds? [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1904.56s)]
*  That was one. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1906.56s)]
*  Yeah, he had a bunch of them. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1907.56s)]
*  Yeah, but the 7 point comeback, 8-0 run in 34 seconds [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1909.56s)]
*  is just unbelievable from the Pacers perspective too. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1913.56s)]
*  Also in that building, which I know you've probably [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1916.56s)]
*  been there for a game, right? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1919.56s)]
*  It's that and the Clippers Arena are the two best arenas [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1921.56s)]
*  and it's just cool that that happened right there. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1924.56s)]
*  I thought Niesman was the best. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1927.56s)]
*  I thought Niesmith, you know, you look at the minutes [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1929.6399999999999s)]
*  and it's not really an accident. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1932.6399999999999s)]
*  Halbert and Siakam, Nemhard, Niesmith and Turner [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1934.6399999999999s)]
*  just all playing huge minutes. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1937.6399999999999s)]
*  Four of those guys were over 40. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1939.6399999999999s)]
*  Matherin, he switched the rotation a little. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1941.6399999999999s)]
*  So Matherin and McConnell basically just come in [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1943.6399999999999s)]
*  for these little 8-9 minute stretches, that's it. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1946.6399999999999s)]
*  Some top and not that much, but I think when we go [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1949.6399999999999s)]
*  to this next round, and I continue to think that they have [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1952.6399999999999s)]
*  a real chance against Cleveland to at least take it six [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1957.72s)]
*  or seven and throw some punches at them, but this Halbert [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1959.72s)]
*  piece, when he realizes he can get to the rim, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1964.72s)]
*  who's stopping him on Cleveland? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1969.72s)]
*  This is a good matchup for him. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1972.72s)]
*  They don't really have a good defender to throw at him. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1974.72s)]
*  I don't know, I just think they can hang in this series. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1978.72s)]
*  They're gonna score points. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1982.72s)]
*  I think the front line of the Cavs will have something [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1984.8s)]
*  to say between Mobley and Allen. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1988.8s)]
*  I like DeAndre Hunter, I like Ty Jerome, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1991.8s)]
*  obviously deserves some credit. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=1999.8s)]
*  But I think, can we do a little bit more on Milwaukee? [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2001.8s)]
*  You look at this team. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2003.8s)]
*  Yeah, let's do it. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2005.8s)]
*  Can we do one more thing on Indiana, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2006.8s)]
*  and then let's do Milwaukee. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2008.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, go ahead. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2009.8s)]
*  What do you think the line is for Indiana-Cleveland? [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2010.8s)]
*  Indiana-Cleveland, Cleveland minus 200. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2012.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Cleveland minus 480. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2017.8799999999999s)]
*  Oh, dang. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2020.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'm telling you, nobody's respecting the Pacers. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2021.8799999999999s)]
*  All right, let's move to Milwaukee because [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2024.8799999999999s)]
*  that did feel like, sometimes you have a feeling [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2027.8799999999999s)]
*  when it's a guy's last game for a team. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2031.8799999999999s)]
*  I remember LeBron in 2010 leaving Boston [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2033.8799999999999s)]
*  in a very strange last game in general by him. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2037.8799999999999s)]
*  But then taking off his jersey right at the end, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2041.96s)]
*  and there's something, he just felt like, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2043.96s)]
*  oh man, this is probably not ending well. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2045.96s)]
*  The honest thing ended a little differently, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2048.96s)]
*  it almost ended with a melee. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2050.96s)]
*  But I find it hard to believe he's gonna be a Buc next year. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2052.96s)]
*  I don't see it. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2056.96s)]
*  And I was listening to Rob Mahoney and Zach [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2058.96s)]
*  who were great the other day, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2060.96s)]
*  and I'll stack on their point. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2061.96s)]
*  Can you blame him? [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2064.96s)]
*  Look at what's happened around him at this franchise [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2065.96s)]
*  since they won it all. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2068.96s)]
*  They've sort of taken the car apart piece by piece, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2070.04s)]
*  and he's really all that's left. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2074.04s)]
*  Lopez is there, Portis is there, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2076.04s)]
*  but Middleton and Holliday are gone. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2079.04s)]
*  Bud is obviously gone. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2083.04s)]
*  And what we see there is, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2085.04s)]
*  Chris Middleton for Kyle Kuzma, are you kidding me? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2089.04s)]
*  And Kuzma's not even playing in these games. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2093.04s)]
*  Like 13 minutes was two, five, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2095.04s)]
*  14 minutes was two, five. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2098.12s)]
*  I did the Was Mahoney trade deadline pot [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2100.12s)]
*  and I was on the record adamantly. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2103.12s)]
*  I did not see the Kuzma thing at all, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2105.12s)]
*  because he hadn't played a meaningful basketball minute [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2107.12s)]
*  or a good basketball minute for like a year. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2110.12s)]
*  Right, since he was at Disney World in the pandemic. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2112.12s)]
*  But yeah, I think, can you blame him? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2116.12s)]
*  I think that's what Mahoney was saying. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2119.12s)]
*  And I think it's fair. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2121.12s)]
*  He got them a title. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2123.12s)]
*  Damien Lillard. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2124.2s)]
*  Can I blame him a little bit? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2125.2s)]
*  For leaving? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2127.2s)]
*  No. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2128.2s)]
*  You can, I mean. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2129.2s)]
*  Can we blame him a little? [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2130.2s)]
*  Because they did that Drew Holliday trade [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2131.2s)]
*  for Dame Lillard, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2135.2s)]
*  because they were feeling some pressure with him to do something [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2137.2s)]
*  because they weren't sure if he wanted to stay or not. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2140.2s)]
*  And that was, I thought it was a panic trade when it happened. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2142.2s)]
*  I was in the minority, but they gave up swaps in 20 and 30. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2145.2s)]
*  They gave up their 29 first. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2149.2s)]
*  They gave up Grayson Allen, who had some, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2151.2799999999997s)]
*  at least it was a bigger contract they could put in a deal. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2154.2799999999997s)]
*  And when you think about it, they kind of shot their asset wide [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2157.2799999999997s)]
*  with Damon Yannis that I just never believed [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2162.2799999999997s)]
*  that made them like a favorite in the East. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2164.2799999999997s)]
*  I thought it was a little bit of a Hail Mary. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2166.2799999999997s)]
*  And would they have been better off keeping Drew [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2169.2799999999997s)]
*  maybe using those picks with Grayson Allen, Chris Middleton, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2172.2799999999997s)]
*  whoever, and trying to add another piece to the foundation? [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2176.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, in retrospect, yes. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2179.36s)]
*  I'll always remember I was at the Grant Williams game in Boston. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2181.36s)]
*  I don't know if you were there. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2184.36s)]
*  I was. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2185.36s)]
*  Zach was talking about it the other day. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2186.36s)]
*  It's like a sliding doors moment, right? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2188.36s)]
*  Because I remember talking to everybody and being like, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2190.36s)]
*  man, it feels like we're going to be watching these two teams play [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2192.36s)]
*  for this Eastern Conference Championship for a long time. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2195.36s)]
*  For all decade, yeah. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2198.36s)]
*  And then this team is just, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2199.36s)]
*  and that's why I think it's an interesting macroscopic study. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2201.36s)]
*  Like you can talk about this collapse in the last 34 seconds here, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2204.36s)]
*  but really this is a collapse that's three or four years long [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2207.44s)]
*  and just goes to speak to the importance of ownership, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2210.44s)]
*  transactions, roster building. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2214.44s)]
*  But dude, yeah, I thought that Giannis and Milwaukee [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2217.44s)]
*  were going to be a big time factor [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2220.44s)]
*  for a huge part of the 2020s. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2223.44s)]
*  And they simply haven't been since that Grant Williams game. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2225.44s)]
*  Well, it starts with the original Drew Holiday trade [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2228.44s)]
*  which helped win them the title. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2231.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2233.44s)]
*  But also included their 24 and 26 first [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2234.52s)]
*  and swaps in 25 and 27 [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2237.52s)]
*  plus the George Hill blood-soak contracts [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2240.52s)]
*  that they kind of were trying to get off of as part of the trade. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2242.52s)]
*  But they're playing catch-up. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2245.52s)]
*  They're playing asset catch-up after that. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2247.52s)]
*  Yeah, and they've not made any good draft picks, Bill, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2249.52s)]
*  during this crucial time [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2252.52s)]
*  where even if you get somebody like Dalton Connect [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2255.52s)]
*  or Corey Joseph, like when the Spurs were picking at the Adaric White, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2257.52s)]
*  we would always pick that guy. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2261.52s)]
*  The Spurs were picking at the Adaric White. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2263.6s)]
*  We would always pick, well, at the end of De'Jonte Murray. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2265.6s)]
*  You've got to get those picks [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2268.6s)]
*  to keep the momentum going, to add role players. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2270.6s)]
*  And they just haven't been able to find anybody in the draft. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2273.6s)]
*  They have AJ Johnson, Tyler Smith, Chris Livingston, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2277.6s)]
*  Beauchamp, Isaiah Todd, R.J. Hampton, Jordan Awora. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2280.6s)]
*  Like, nothing. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2285.6s)]
*  That's their 2020s draft history. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2287.6s)]
*  So it's just they haven't been able to build [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2289.6s)]
*  a huge reason why this roster is so thin, too. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2292.68s)]
*  Well, the red flag was when Lazare, the co-owner, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2295.68s)]
*  he finished his managing partner thing [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2298.68s)]
*  and then he's like, I'm out of here. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2300.68s)]
*  And he sold this steak to the Browns owner. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2302.68s)]
*  And he's like, ah, that's curious. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2304.68s)]
*  And it was like, you know, he was like 2008, the big short. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2306.68s)]
*  He knew it was coming. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2309.68s)]
*  Where do you want Giannis to go? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2311.68s)]
*  Oh, well, if San Antonio is an option. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2313.68s)]
*  Just as a basketball fan, where do you want him to go? [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2316.68s)]
*  I mean, I will again, hand up. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2319.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm very biased like you are with the Celtics. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2321.7599999999998s)]
*  I will say the San Antonio Spurs. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2323.7599999999998s)]
*  I think it would be a really perfect pairing [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2325.7599999999998s)]
*  evoking the great Duncan, Tim Robinson era [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2328.7599999999998s)]
*  or David Robinson, Tim Duncan era. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2331.7599999999998s)]
*  Tim Robinson, Netflix comedian Tim Robinson. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2333.7599999999998s)]
*  Dude, I saw his new A24 movie. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2336.7599999999998s)]
*  What is that called? [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2339.7599999999998s)]
*  But anyway, I think that's what about you? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2340.7599999999998s)]
*  San Antonio is the high upside. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2344.84s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2346.84s)]
*  Like galaxy brain explosion. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2347.84s)]
*  And they have the assets right to do it. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2350.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2353.84s)]
*  But that's that would be the one that I think made everybody go. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2354.84s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2357.84s)]
*  What's that going to look like? [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2358.84s)]
*  I think that's a pretty weird fit in some ways offensively. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2359.84s)]
*  But in other ways, the fact that Wemby wants to be 25 feet [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2363.84s)]
*  from the basket and Giannis should probably be playing [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2366.84s)]
*  closer to the basket. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2369.84s)]
*  Maybe that fits. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2370.84s)]
*  But I think that's the way it should be. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2371.84s)]
*  Maybe that fits. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2373.92s)]
*  But defensively, that sounds like an all time nightmare [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2374.92s)]
*  from how are you going to attack the room against those two guys? [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2377.92s)]
*  You might as well just go to Jack Three's. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2380.92s)]
*  It's just like David Robinson and Tim Duncan 20 years ago. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2382.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's it's that's why I love it. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2385.92s)]
*  It's a fantasy of mine. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2387.92s)]
*  Realistically, I don't I don't know if that's a possibility. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2388.92s)]
*  Have you thought about other destinations? [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2392.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Rosselle and I talked about a little on Sunday, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2395.92s)]
*  just like the obvious ones, Houston, because they have [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2398.92s)]
*  the problem for Milwaukee is they don't really have their picks. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2402.0s)]
*  So it's not like they, you know, it's not like it makes sense [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2405.0s)]
*  for them to tank because what are they tanking for? [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2408.0s)]
*  They don't have their picks to tank for. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2410.0s)]
*  So what makes more sense is like them doing a two for one [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2413.0s)]
*  and a three for one and getting a couple assets back with that. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2417.0s)]
*  So that's that's the Rockets, basically. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2420.0s)]
*  That's one. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2423.0s)]
*  And I think you're probably trying to get some sort of big piece. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2424.0s)]
*  The Knicks are the other one that I think would be mildly intriguing [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2427.0s)]
*  if it was a town's. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2430.08s)]
*  Bridges, Janice going back with a contract and. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2432.08s)]
*  You know, you start doing that. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2437.08s)]
*  There's been smoke around Miami and Janice for years. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2438.08s)]
*  And he's in the same spot there that he's in with Milwaukee. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2442.08s)]
*  Miami sucks. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2445.08s)]
*  I just got absolutely annihilated in the Cleveland series. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2446.08s)]
*  They had their whole team. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2449.08s)]
*  It's not like somebody was missing again when Ernie Johnson at halftime [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2450.08s)]
*  is like, this is the worst basketball game. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2454.08s)]
*  Yeah, we're not showing highlights. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2456.08s)]
*  He's saying that on air, by the way. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2458.16s)]
*  He's not saying that at the water cooler before they go to the segment. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2460.16s)]
*  He's saying that on air. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2463.16s)]
*  That's how bad it was. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2464.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2465.16s)]
*  Yeah, well, we'll see. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2466.16s)]
*  I don't I don't think he's there next year, though. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2467.16s)]
*  It did feel like there was some sort of a finale to it. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2469.16s)]
*  But you never know with these guys like the key to me is here. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2472.16s)]
*  He won the title. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2475.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2476.16s)]
*  So when you've already won, it's like, I don't know. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2477.16s)]
*  I like it here. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2480.16s)]
*  But there's always been some some Brooklyn buzz. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2481.16s)]
*  The problem with a team like Brooklyn is, can you give the assets back [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2485.24s)]
*  that actually makes it make sense for Milwaukee who can't tank? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2489.24s)]
*  You know, what's the point of Milwaukee going 20 and 62 next year [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2493.24s)]
*  if their pick is going somewhere else? [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2497.24s)]
*  They might not have a choice. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2499.24s)]
*  We've seen that one before, too. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2501.24s)]
*  But what do you mean about Wemby, by the way? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2502.24s)]
*  Anything I think there is his he's on schedule to return for for next season. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2505.24s)]
*  I haven't heard anything specific medically, but he was caught playing [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2510.3199999999997s)]
*  soccer in Costa Rica on video. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2515.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't know if you saw that bill. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2517.3199999999997s)]
*  It was it was a very interesting video was like this that video. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2518.3199999999997s)]
*  That sounds great. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2522.3199999999997s)]
*  Hey, you got to be deep onto the Spurs message boards to see these [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2523.3199999999997s)]
*  these great videos of Wemby playing soccer. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2527.3199999999997s)]
*  Do they rig the draft for Cooper flag for the Spurs like they did with Tim [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2531.3199999999997s)]
*  Dunn? [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2535.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, they just got two Rookie of the Year's in a row. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2536.4s)]
*  So why not go for three? [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2539.4s)]
*  I mean, shout out to Steve Castle, Stephen Castle for getting the [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2540.4s)]
*  the Rookie of the Year. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2545.4s)]
*  Not a great class, but I thought he was deserving. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2547.4s)]
*  I don't think they're going to rig the draft for the Spurs to get Cooper flag. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2550.4s)]
*  But, dude, Cooper flag can play, dude. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2554.4s)]
*  This guy is going to change the fate of wherever he gets. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2557.4s)]
*  This is another way to get the Spurs. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2559.4s)]
*  I mean, I think it's a great way to get the Spurs. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2561.4s)]
*  This guy is going to change the fate of wherever he gets. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2563.48s)]
*  This is another one of the biggest lotteries of the century. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2565.48s)]
*  Whoever gets that number one. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2569.48s)]
*  Well, the good thing is there's other good guys. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2571.48s)]
*  Like even if you get the third or fourth pick in this draft, you're going to get [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2573.48s)]
*  somebody who's like even Edgecombe is like a real guy. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2577.48s)]
*  Like if he the Spurs got him and put him with Castle and all their wings, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2580.48s)]
*  like that's an amazing outcome. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2584.48s)]
*  Yeah, the Spurs have two picks they're pretty excited about. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2586.48s)]
*  I think most likely outcome is right. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2588.48s)]
*  Eight and fourteen, something like that. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2590.48s)]
*  And they could combine those and try to move up or they've drafted pretty well in the past. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2592.56s)]
*  Or they send both of them to Milwaukee in the Yadis trade. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2598.56s)]
*  Yannis and Wemby. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2603.56s)]
*  I mean, talk about an international basketball team. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2604.56s)]
*  That's like the league's wet dream. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2606.56s)]
*  I know. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2608.56s)]
*  Yannis is the greatest international story they've ever had other than Hakim. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2609.56s)]
*  And Wemby is going to be the true galaxy face of the league. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2612.56s)]
*  They're hoping four or five years from now, unless Anthony Edwards takes that. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2618.56s)]
*  Who do you have in Minnesota Lakers? [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2621.64s)]
*  You have to take Minnesota at this point. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2624.64s)]
*  You know, JJ Redick, I think, you know, there's two reasons, depth and defense. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2626.64s)]
*  The Lakers don't have much either. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2633.64s)]
*  And I think the stat was that nobody has ever played all five dudes for the last 24 minutes of a playoff game. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2635.64s)]
*  And JJ just did that. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2642.64s)]
*  That tells you something. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2644.64s)]
*  Yeah, but Denver did the same thing on Saturday and it worked. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2646.64s)]
*  And now we don't have to hear about it anymore because they won the game. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2649.72s)]
*  JJ did it. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2652.72s)]
*  I'm not defending JJ. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2653.72s)]
*  I don't understand why he would have paid Gabe Vinson for five minutes. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2654.72s)]
*  He was, I feel okay with Gabe Vinson out there. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2657.72s)]
*  I didn't get that. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2660.72s)]
*  You'd like to think Jackson Hayes can do something. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2661.72s)]
*  But I think Minnesota just deserves credit. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2664.72s)]
*  And the other thing is the defense. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2667.72s)]
*  Los Angeles defense is not good enough. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2669.72s)]
*  Jade McDaniels is exposing them on drives and no disrespect to Jade McDaniels. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2671.72s)]
*  He's helping Minnesota win this series. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2676.7999999999997s)]
*  But that goes to show that this is not the Thunder defense, dude. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2679.7999999999997s)]
*  This is not the Rockets defense. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2684.7999999999997s)]
*  This is the Lakers defense. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2687.7999999999997s)]
*  It's been a red flag for me for a while. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2688.7999999999997s)]
*  No rim protection, no rim runner. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2691.7999999999997s)]
*  The rim, just not really above. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2694.7999999999997s)]
*  And Luca has not been great on defense. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2697.7999999999997s)]
*  And again, the Western Conference is unforgiving. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2701.7999999999997s)]
*  You want to call it a weak link era of NBA basketball. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2705.88s)]
*  Fine. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2708.88s)]
*  We're hunting matchups. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2709.88s)]
*  Whatever you want to say. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2710.88s)]
*  Anthony Edwards is just the best offensive player in the series right now. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2711.88s)]
*  And on top of that, I think Minnesota has a better defense and more depth. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2718.88s)]
*  So I'm taking Minnesota, Bill. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2725.88s)]
*  I agree. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2727.88s)]
*  I think there might be a free throw discrepancy tomorrow. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2728.88s)]
*  Is it tomorrow? [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2731.88s)]
*  I'm guessing tomorrow. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2732.88s)]
*  I'm going tomorrow and I'm just going to be laughing all the time. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2733.96s)]
*  You're going to games back to back, huh? [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2736.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2739.96s)]
*  Sports. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2740.96s)]
*  Basketball, playoff basketball. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2741.96s)]
*  No, it's the best. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2742.96s)]
*  Sadly, it's going to be over soon. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2743.96s)]
*  Have you seen anything that makes you think it's not going to be Boston OKC? [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2745.96s)]
*  I think Cleveland deserves a little more respect. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2748.96s)]
*  And the Drew Holliday hamstring injury, Bill Simmons. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2752.96s)]
*  Not happy about it. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2757.96s)]
*  Yeah, not great. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2758.96s)]
*  So look, Cleveland. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2760.04s)]
*  I think if Boston is limited somehow, Cleveland is a very dangerous team. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2762.04s)]
*  So Drew Holliday and Street Close is my answer to that question. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2768.04s)]
*  Have I seen anything that makes me think Boston might not get there? [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2771.04s)]
*  If he comes back, I love that dude. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2774.04s)]
*  If Porzingis is healthy, if Tatum is playing like this, Jalen Brown, Derek White, Peyton Pritchard, Joe Mazzullo. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2776.04s)]
*  I think they deserve to be favorites coming out of the East. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2783.04s)]
*  But Cleveland is shooting the shit out of the basketball. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2786.12s)]
*  They've been a great team all year. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2791.12s)]
*  They've won in Boston, if I'm not mistaken. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2793.12s)]
*  Mitchell always does well against Celtics. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2796.12s)]
*  They always get games. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2799.12s)]
*  So it'll be a good series. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2800.12s)]
*  I'm picking Boston, but I will not be shocked whether it's because Drew Holliday is limited, somebody else goes down, that Cleveland wins the Eastern Conference. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2801.12s)]
*  So I think that's the case. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2810.12s)]
*  On the Western side, OKC, again, clear favorite. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2812.2s)]
*  I don't see anybody in their class right now on the Western Conference side. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2816.2s)]
*  I don't either, but who knows with this Minnesota piece? [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2821.2s)]
*  And who knows with Golden State? [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2825.2s)]
*  Because Golden State's love playing OKC forever. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2827.2s)]
*  And, you know, I'm not going to, I'm just, I would, if I had to bet, I would stick with my preseason OKC Boston. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2829.2s)]
*  But I think Minnesota and Golden State and then the way Denver played tonight, who knows? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2837.2s)]
*  All right, Kurt Goldsberry, writing for TheRinger.com, popping on our podcast. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2841.2799999999997s)]
*  Always good to see you. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2846.2799999999997s)]
*  Thank you, Bill. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2847.2799999999997s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E1SBelbh34&t=2848.2799999999997s)]
