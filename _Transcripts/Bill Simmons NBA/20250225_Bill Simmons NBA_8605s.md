# Luka’s Revenge, NFL QB Roulette, Stafford Trades & ‘White Lotus' Secrets | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ)
*  The Bill Simmons podcast presented by Fandool Sportsbook. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I am recording this right after Lakers maps, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3.36s)]
*  just the very top here. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5.72s)]
*  Four things I wanted to hit coming off that game. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7.28s)]
*  Number one, the Luka Donch's trade is now kind of seeming [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=9.76s)]
*  stupid for Dallas. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=13.32s)]
*  Oh wait, it was stupid immediately when it happened. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=16.96s)]
*  This is just a disaster. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=20.52s)]
*  I can't believe Nico Harrison actually went to the game. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=22.28s)]
*  Like they weren't gonna chant thank you Nico at him [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=26.2s)]
*  for two and a half hours. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=29.2s)]
*  If I was him, I would have pretended to have COVID, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=30.6s)]
*  the flu, bronchitis, I don't know what, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=34.0s)]
*  but I would not have wanted to be in the building. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=36.44s)]
*  That's just nuts. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=38.2s)]
*  All right, three actual takeaways. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=40.0s)]
*  One, this is already the best rivalry in the NBA. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=42.24s)]
*  I am the most interested in every Lakers Mavericks game [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=46.6s)]
*  from now on. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=49.08s)]
*  We didn't even have Anthony Davis tonight. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=49.92s)]
*  We didn't have Gafford, we didn't have Lively. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=51.56s)]
*  There's gonna be a version of this game, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=53.2s)]
*  at least for this season and next season, I would guess, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=56.0s)]
*  where you have this big Mavericks team with a bunch of size [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=59.56s)]
*  and then you have this weird Lakers team [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=62.88s)]
*  that's kind of playing small, but they're not small [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=64.56s)]
*  because their front court has 800 pounds of guys. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=66.72s)]
*  Then Luka trying to get revenge against his old team [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=70.2s)]
*  and just a lot of different storylines [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=73.72s)]
*  that I think are great. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=75.44s)]
*  We had this in the 2000s, the seeds of it, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=77.2s)]
*  when Shaq went to Miami, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  but Kobe's Lakers team wasn't good enough. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=81.84s)]
*  We had the seeds of it when Durant went to Golden State [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=84.36s)]
*  in 2016 and then there was gonna be an OKC Golden State [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=87.8s)]
*  rivalry, but Golden State was just way better than OKC. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=91.56s)]
*  This has a chance to be a really fun back and forth [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=93.88s)]
*  every time they play. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=97.44s)]
*  It's gonna be a fun game like the one tonight [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=98.32s)]
*  and I'm looking forward to it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=100.16s)]
*  I would say for the rest of the 2020s, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=101.28s)]
*  this is our best bet for an awesome NBA rivalry. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=103.52s)]
*  Like Boston, Cleveland, maybe that'll get there. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=106.36s)]
*  I doubt we're gonna have all the storylines [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=109.44s)]
*  and the baggage that this one has. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=111.32s)]
*  I don't know, Minnesota, OKC, sure. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  SGA, Anthony Edwards, that'll be great. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=116.32s)]
*  Can't wait to watch those guys battle, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  but it's not gonna have the baggage [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=120.2s)]
*  in the history of this rivalry. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=122.4s)]
*  So depending on how long LeBron is able to play [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=123.88s)]
*  at this level, this is the best we're gonna do. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=126.28s)]
*  Could we get this as a 2-7 matchup in the NBA playoffs? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=129.52s)]
*  So Lakers right now, 35 and 21. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=135.12s)]
*  Two seed is conceivable for them. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=140.84s)]
*  Dallas right now is the eight seed. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=143.12s)]
*  There's a bunch of teams tied in between seven and 10. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=144.52s)]
*  They're getting some guys back soon. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  If you wanna get good ratings, NBA, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=150.52s)]
*  I would rig a 2-7 Lakers-Dallas, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=152.68s)]
*  I think would be the way to do it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=155.56s)]
*  Anyway, this is an awesome rivalry. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=157.52s)]
*  That was my first takeaway tonight watching this, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=159.28s)]
*  for I'm just like, this is must watch TV every time [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  these two teams play. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=163.0s)]
*  Second one is the Lakers, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=164.84s)]
*  who Russel and I talked about on Sunday night. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=166.16000000000003s)]
*  I think they're a wild card contender. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=169.84s)]
*  They're not one of the four contenders to win the title, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=172.0s)]
*  but they might be fifth. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=174.92s)]
*  And they're definitely the, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=177.56s)]
*  I don't know what the ceiling is of this team yet. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=179.84s)]
*  They're 15 and four in their last 19 now. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=182.28s)]
*  They've been top five net the whole time. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=184.4s)]
*  Rui at center, which they've done from time to time [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=186.76s)]
*  when AD was out, but they're doing it by necessity now [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=191.0s)]
*  because the Mark Williams trade got canceled. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=194.36s)]
*  He's a little Carl Anthony Towns this chair at times, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=197.16s)]
*  and I mean that in a good way. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=200.24s)]
*  He's got size, he could stretch the floor, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=202.56s)]
*  and he's just big enough that he can push [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=205.44s)]
*  against a post-up player, not a rim protector, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=207.64s)]
*  neither is Towns. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=211.8s)]
*  But when you watch them and it's their crunch time today, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=213.32s)]
*  and I think their crunch time just going forward, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=216.2s)]
*  Reeves as the point guard, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=218.68s)]
*  even though he's not a point guard. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=220.6s)]
*  Rui is the center, even though he's not a center. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=222.56s)]
*  And then LeBron and Luca and Finney Smith as the wings. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=225.36s)]
*  And they're all just really smart basketball players [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=229.92s)]
*  who can kind of fill in the blanks and not totally get burned. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  The rim protection is not gonna be perfect. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=234.68s)]
*  There's gonna be guards like Kyrie tonight [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  that they're just not gonna be able to stay in front of [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=238.72s)]
*  unless it's a team defensive concept. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=240.88s)]
*  I think it works. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=244.68s)]
*  I'm bullish on this Lakers team as a contender. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=246.12s)]
*  Everyone's like, oh, you hate the Lakers, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=248.6s)]
*  you hate the Lakers. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=250.12s)]
*  When the Lakers are good, I'm gonna admit it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  We were admitting it, we were doing pods all the way up [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=253.12s)]
*  until COVID happened in the 2019-20 season [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=255.68s)]
*  and I'm saying the Lakers Clippers are the two best teams. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=258.32s)]
*  I think the Lakers are a legit contender [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=260.08s)]
*  and I think they can get away with these goofy lineups [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=263.0s)]
*  because they're really well-coached [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=266.03999999999996s)]
*  and their best two players are really smart [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=267.71999999999997s)]
*  and know where to go and what to do. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=269.47999999999996s)]
*  So that's my second takeaway. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=271.64s)]
*  Ironically, Luca is not in any of my big three takeaways [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=274.64s)]
*  because we know how talented he is, we know how good he is. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=277.52s)]
*  And it was interesting. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=281.79999999999995s)]
*  You would have bet, if you're betting on Fandall, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  you're doing the same game. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=285.84s)]
*  They had the Parlay boost token. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=287.2s)]
*  The obvious bet would have been, oh, Luca, revenge, points. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  And it never works out that way. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=296.03999999999996s)]
*  He just did the classic other version of a Luca game [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=297.24s)]
*  where he filled out every part of the box score, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=300.12s)]
*  got a triple double, but he did not have the 40 point game, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=301.84s)]
*  which I think, when you think about revenge, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=305.44s)]
*  it wasn't what we saw tonight, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=309.44s)]
*  but he played a really smart offensive game [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=311.08s)]
*  and really controlled it and did a lot of good stuff. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=313.15999999999997s)]
*  But that leads to the third thing. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=315.08s)]
*  Watching LeBron reinvent himself on the fly, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=318.08s)]
*  and I think this is his 22nd NBA season, at age 40, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=322.28s)]
*  when we thought we had seen every version [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=326.88s)]
*  of whatever was happening with him, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=328.76s)]
*  I didn't think he ever had a chance [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=330.12s)]
*  to compete for a title again. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=331.56s)]
*  And almost immediately, he has figured out [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=334.2s)]
*  how to kind of coexist with Luca, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=337.52s)]
*  how to let Luca have the ball way more than we've ever seen [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=339.36s)]
*  LeBron be comfortable with with a teammate [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=342.32s)]
*  since 2011 Miami, playing off the ball [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=345.23999999999995s)]
*  and figuring out how to affect the game [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=349.32s)]
*  in all these different ways. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  And then when he gets the ball, doing LeBron things. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=351.79999999999995s)]
*  This is a hybrid of 2011 Miami, that first year, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=355.67999999999995s)]
*  when it was still Wade's team, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=360.32s)]
*  and he was kind of easing his way into it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=361.96s)]
*  He was still getting his stats, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=363.47999999999996s)]
*  but there was a lot of time when Wade was cooking, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=364.64s)]
*  because Wade was one of the three best players in the league, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=367.08s)]
*  and he's deferring to Luca, at least what we've seen so far, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=369.96000000000004s)]
*  while also trying to figure out [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=373.6s)]
*  all these different ways to fit in. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=375.04s)]
*  He'll get these sneaky offensive rebounds. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=376.56s)]
*  He only had two assists today, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=378.76s)]
*  because he didn't have the ball that much, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=379.96000000000004s)]
*  but he still ended up with, I think he had 25 and 12, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=381.48s)]
*  got some big rebounds. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=385.20000000000005s)]
*  And then defensively, the first two months of the season, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=387.56s)]
*  he was just atrocious defensively, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=391.8s)]
*  and all the advanced metrics backed it up. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=394.36s)]
*  And he's been way more active, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=396.8s)]
*  and I'm just really impressed. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=398.84s)]
*  The defensive rebounding and the off the ball stuff [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=401.67999999999995s)]
*  is about as high level as it gets. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=404.08s)]
*  We were working on the ringer 100 stuff, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=405.91999999999996s)]
*  and after the second month of the season, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=408.52s)]
*  I didn't think there was any case for him [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=412.59999999999997s)]
*  to be a top 25 player anymore. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=413.91999999999996s)]
*  I don't think there's nine players [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=416.55999999999995s)]
*  playing better than him right now. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=418.88s)]
*  Like you go Jokic, SGA, Janis, Tatum, those four. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=420.55999999999995s)]
*  Luka from a pedigree has to be still a top 10 player. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=425.56s)]
*  Mitchell Brunson Edwards. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=429.32s)]
*  And then it's LeBron and Cade [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=432.24s)]
*  are probably the 10 best players in the league right now. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=434.16s)]
*  There's been some injuries. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=436.32s)]
*  We've lost some guys. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=437.24s)]
*  But LeBron has to be in the top 10, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=438.6s)]
*  and I think he's a second team NBA guy [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=440.24s)]
*  the way this is going. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=442.36s)]
*  He's been awesome. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=443.88s)]
*  And at this point in his career, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=445.68s)]
*  when he's done pretty much everything you can do, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=449.0s)]
*  and we see a lot of the old superstars, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=450.88s)]
*  Doug Collins always used to talk about how hard it is [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=453.56s)]
*  to coach an old superstar. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=455.79999999999995s)]
*  He seems like he's completely bought into, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=457.71999999999997s)]
*  hey, we might actually have a chance to win. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=461.15999999999997s)]
*  What do I have to do? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=463.12s)]
*  It doesn't seem like there's a lot of ego stuff, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=465.12s)]
*  which you see with a lot of older players. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=467.2s)]
*  Just how do I fit in? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=468.84s)]
*  How do we win? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=470.35999999999996s)]
*  How can I chip in? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=471.79999999999995s)]
*  It's really interesting to watch. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=474.03999999999996s)]
*  And I'm taking the Lakers seriously. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=475.47999999999996s)]
*  So those are my big takeaways from Lakers. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=477.4s)]
*  Mavs, we have a lot more on the podcast coming up. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=479.84s)]
*  Hey, don't leave the podcast now. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=482.88s)]
*  I still got football and white lotus for you next. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=484.15999999999997s)]
*  We're also brought to you by the Ringer Podcast Network, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=486.56s)]
*  where I put up a brand new rewatchables on Monday night. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=489.35999999999996s)]
*  Me and Van Lathan and Joanna Robinson did Crash, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=492.08s)]
*  the 2006 Oscar winner. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=494.88s)]
*  It's the 20th anniversary of that movie. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=496.71999999999997s)]
*  We rarely do this on the rewatchables, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=500.0s)]
*  where we just bring a movie on, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=502.08s)]
*  just so we can pick nets with it for an hour and a half [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=503.55999999999995s)]
*  and make fun of it and do a whole bunch of things. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=507.23999999999995s)]
*  I had a really good time. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=510.64s)]
*  I thought this was a very entertaining episode. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=511.64s)]
*  Every once in a while, we just got to do this [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=513.52s)]
*  to keep the muscles fresh. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=515.16s)]
*  Anyway, you can watch that as a video podcast on Spotify. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=516.48s)]
*  You can go to the Ringer Movies YouTube channel [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=520.1999999999999s)]
*  and watch it there as well. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=522.1999999999999s)]
*  You can get all the videos and clips from this podcast [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=524.24s)]
*  on the Bill Simmons YouTube channel. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=527.96s)]
*  And then last but not least, Celtic City on HBO, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=531.56s)]
*  Sunday night, March 3rd, HBO Max. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=536.4399999999999s)]
*  It's gonna be once a week, it's nine episodes. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=541.6s)]
*  It's one of the coolest projects I've been involved with, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=545.1600000000001s)]
*  and I'm really psyched for everybody to watch it. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=547.5600000000001s)]
*  So mark it down. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=549.8800000000001s)]
*  I know there's a lot of good TV on these days, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=551.6400000000001s)]
*  but mark down Celtic City. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=553.6400000000001s)]
*  It's coming. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=555.6400000000001s)]
*  I'll talk more about it on Thursday's podcast. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=556.5600000000001s)]
*  Coming up for the rest of this podcast, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=559.32s)]
*  Shilka Patti and I are gonna talk about [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=560.84s)]
*  the quarterback situation in the NFL right now. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=563.2s)]
*  A lot of teams that need one, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=566.32s)]
*  a lot of teams that can't find one, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=567.7600000000001s)]
*  some guys that might be moving teams, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=569.4000000000001s)]
*  some top 10, possibly top five, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=572.0400000000001s)]
*  possibly top three quarterback prospects [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=573.84s)]
*  that are gonna make the draft more interesting. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=577.4000000000001s)]
*  So we're gonna cover all of that. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=579.24s)]
*  And then my friend Dave Barnett is gonna come on, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=581.12s)]
*  who is an EP of White Lotus [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=584.1600000000001s)]
*  and has been a producer for a long time. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=586.2s)]
*  His story is interesting. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=587.6800000000001s)]
*  His story is about White Lotus [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=588.6800000000001s)]
*  and just like what it's like when you see somebody [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=590.0s)]
*  as an executive producer of a scripted TV show. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=592.36s)]
*  What is that job? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=595.5600000000001s)]
*  What do they do? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=596.4000000000001s)]
*  We're gonna dive into all of it. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=597.6400000000001s)]
*  I promise you're gonna like it. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=598.8000000000001s)]
*  So that is what's happening. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=600.0s)]
*  First, our friends from Pearl Jam. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=601.92s)]
*  ["Ringers"] [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=603.72s)]
*  All right, Shilka Patti from the Ringers here. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=625.2s)]
*  A roller coaster ride of a month for him. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=627.08s)]
*  The Eagles win the Super Bowl [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=629.04s)]
*  in about as convincing a fashion as we've had in a while. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=630.64s)]
*  And then on the flip side, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=633.6s)]
*  the Sixers have spiraled into a fiery pit of hell. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=635.28s)]
*  Do you care, does anyone in Philly even care [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=639.0s)]
*  about the Sixers right now? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=640.84s)]
*  A little bit, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=642.28s)]
*  but you can't wipe the smiles off everyone's faces. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=643.12s)]
*  It usually just goes back to the Eagles and the Super Bowl [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=645.32s)]
*  and then rooting now for the Sixers [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=648.48s)]
*  to just hold on to that pick one through six. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=650.56s)]
*  I think that's what it's returned to here. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=653.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's gonna be, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=655.84s)]
*  if they end up in the sixth spot [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=657.04s)]
*  and it's a top six protected pick [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=659.3199999999999s)]
*  and you're just holding your fingers crossed [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=661.8399999999999s)]
*  that nobody leapfrogs them. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=664.16s)]
*  I think ending up at seven [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=666.0799999999999s)]
*  after how devastated in the season would have been is, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=667.4s)]
*  that would be an all-timer. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=670.5999999999999s)]
*  The Eagles thing, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=672.12s)]
*  I'm still kicking myself for not picking them. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=673.28s)]
*  I have so many regrets. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=676.0799999999999s)]
*  I talked to you that first week [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=677.48s)]
*  of before we got into the Super Bowl week. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=679.28s)]
*  I'm like, I'm taking the Eagles, I'm taking them. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=681.48s)]
*  I really think they have a better team. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=683.28s)]
*  Then by Wednesday, the Mahomes Kool-Aid had washed over me [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=685.24s)]
*  and the fear of just being wrong and having Mahomes, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=688.96s)]
*  I'm like, God, and it just, that was it. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=693.96s)]
*  That was the only reason. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=696.96s)]
*  I'm never doing that again. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=698.24s)]
*  If all the evidence is on one team like that, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=699.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm just never doing that again. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=702.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm never buying into this whole amorphous, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=703.72s)]
*  well, you gotta do it. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=706.72s)]
*  They win all the time. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=707.64s)]
*  This is the stupidest thing you can do. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=708.84s)]
*  Why did we do it? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=710.36s)]
*  I picked the Eagles. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=712.36s)]
*  No, I know you did. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=713.44s)]
*  You picked the Mahomes pickers. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=714.28s)]
*  It came down to, yes, great quarterback versus great team. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=715.88s)]
*  I think we knew the Eagles had the better team, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=719.36s)]
*  numbers two through 53. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=721.68s)]
*  I don't think, I don't know anybody [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=723.92s)]
*  that picked the Eagles to blow them out in that fashion, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=725.64s)]
*  the way they did. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=728.28s)]
*  No one does that to the Chiefs. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=729.12s)]
*  I mean, really, it was an all-time performance. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=731.24s)]
*  That's why everybody still, anywhere you go, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=733.56s)]
*  still has the Eagles gear on and is not ready [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=736.52s)]
*  to turn the page to any of the other teams right now. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=738.8399999999999s)]
*  So all the Eagles fans have told me [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=741.4399999999999s)]
*  that the Pat Super Bowl, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=743.6800000000001s)]
*  because it was the first one of this, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=745.0s)]
*  of two generations, basically, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=746.96s)]
*  was a more emotional, better one, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=748.44s)]
*  but this was, in a lot of ways, more satisfying. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=749.9200000000001s)]
*  Especially the Jalen Hurts piece of it, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=753.88s)]
*  which I think as we get away from that game [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=757.16s)]
*  and the days pass and it's just, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=759.32s)]
*  weren't really sure what you had with that guy. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=761.44s)]
*  And then he was really awesome. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=763.08s)]
*  I was watching some of the Inside the NFL type stuff [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=764.36s)]
*  after that game. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=767.4s)]
*  He was just great in that game. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=768.24s)]
*  I mean, that's one of the better QB performances. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=769.2s)]
*  So going forward, for the money you're paying, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=771.12s)]
*  all right, it's like, all right, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=774.64s)]
*  we can win the Super Bowl with this guy. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=775.6s)]
*  This is good. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=777.08s)]
*  What is the shelf life for the Seagulls team [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=778.36s)]
*  with all the stuff they've done with the cap? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=780.36s)]
*  Because I know they were maneuvering [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=782.48s)]
*  and getting a little creative, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=783.84s)]
*  but at some point that runs out, right? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=785.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think you and I talked about [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=787.4s)]
*  quarterback analysis before. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=788.96s)]
*  And has it gone too far where now [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=790.52s)]
*  we don't care as much if the guy is winning? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=792.5600000000001s)]
*  It's more about the film and the analytics. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=794.64s)]
*  And Hurts has kind of been a throwback [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=797.44s)]
*  where all season long, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=798.96s)]
*  we had conversations. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=800.56s)]
*  It's like, all right, it's a little up and down. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=801.64s)]
*  And then the two biggest games of the year, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=803.6s)]
*  he comes through and is fantastic [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=805.72s)]
*  in the NFC Championship game and the Super Bowl. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=807.56s)]
*  So I'm with you. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=809.9599999999999s)]
*  I think it changed his sort of his legacy [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=810.8s)]
*  and the way he's viewed, at least locally, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=813.4s)]
*  but also nationally. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=815.68s)]
*  And in terms of the window, they're in a good spot. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=816.64s)]
*  You mentioned it, 2017, it was like, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=819.0s)]
*  that was magical for everyone [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=821.12s)]
*  because they had never done it before. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=822.6s)]
*  This feels like it's built to last. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=824.1999999999999s)]
*  They've got young guys in the secondary. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=825.84s)]
*  They've got young defensive linemen. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=827.8s)]
*  They're gonna bring back 10 of 11 starters, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=829.44s)]
*  at least on offense. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=831.36s)]
*  And so, yeah, they're in a very good spot [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=833.12s)]
*  where I would expect this. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=835.12s)]
*  You never know if you get to another one [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=836.12s)]
*  or win another one, but the window is more open [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=837.8000000000001s)]
*  than it was, I think, the last time they won one. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=840.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you figure it's four or five years for the window. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=842.48s)]
*  That was certainly the Pats had three different windows [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=845.1600000000001s)]
*  during the Brady era. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=847.6s)]
*  And, you know, as we've discussed in the past, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=849.08s)]
*  all of them hinge on, if you can nail a couple of drafts [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=851.8000000000001s)]
*  in a row, which is the Eagles did that. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=854.08s)]
*  They're probably the best example of that, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=855.96s)]
*  the drafts that they had the last couple of years. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=857.56s)]
*  And then, looking out with that linebacker [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=859.92s)]
*  who now is gonna become one of the top three agents, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=862.68s)]
*  a couple really shrewd signings [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=865.3199999999999s)]
*  where you pay X amount for somebody [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=866.84s)]
*  and then he turns out to be an A-lister. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=869.4s)]
*  It's really impressive. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=871.8s)]
*  You don't think there's an unexpected trade with them, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=872.96s)]
*  though, right? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=877.36s)]
*  There's no, hey, here's the time to trade AJ Brown [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=878.1999999999999s)]
*  right now for draft capital so we can get, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=881.0799999999999s)]
*  like, are they gonna do anything crazy? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=883.36s)]
*  I don't think they're gonna trade a core player [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=885.0799999999999s)]
*  if there's an unexpected trade. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=887.04s)]
*  If Miles Garrett gets dealt and it's a position of need [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=889.12s)]
*  and you say, hey, we're not gonna be drafting Kai [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=892.7199999999999s)]
*  in the next couple of years anyway, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=894.5999999999999s)]
*  and this is a premium position, an elite player [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=896.5999999999999s)]
*  to add to the best defense in the NFL, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=899.3199999999999s)]
*  that to me would be a Howie Roseman move. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=901.48s)]
*  I don't know that it's gonna happen, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=903.64s)]
*  but when I look at the list of teams that I would say [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=904.9599999999999s)]
*  I could actually see them giving up a haul for Miles Garrett, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=907.48s)]
*  I would put them on that list of two or three teams. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=911.16s)]
*  You don't think Parsons gets into play this year, right? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=914.12s)]
*  No? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=917.5600000000001s)]
*  I think this is the Cowboys being the Cowboys. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=918.4000000000001s)]
*  Let's get ourselves in the headlines for three months [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=920.0400000000001s)]
*  over some nonsense and then we'll end up making him [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=922.88s)]
*  the highest paid defensive player in NFL history. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=925.2800000000001s)]
*  I don't know how you take yourself seriously [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=927.76s)]
*  and trade a generational defensive player like that, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=931.0s)]
*  but I guess who knows? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=934.5200000000001s)]
*  Well, it's the thing where you've already committed [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=935.96s)]
*  to these other guys money-wise, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=938.88s)]
*  and it's almost like you've made the mistake of doing that [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=941.0400000000001s)]
*  and now you compound the mistake by doing the second thing. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=944.6s)]
*  It's almost like the Embiid extension the Sixers did, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=946.0s)]
*  where it's like, well, we're all in, okay, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=948.72s)]
*  here's the extension and you're just making things worth. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=950.08s)]
*  So Eagles plus 650 on Fandl to win the Super Bowl again. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=953.36s)]
*  They're the favorites. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=957.6800000000001s)]
*  KC 701, which I thought was ambitious [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=959.08s)]
*  because that's an aging team in a lot of respects. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=961.64s)]
*  I don't know, they have the same offensive line problems [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=966.0s)]
*  that half the league has. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=968.76s)]
*  It can't be like, well, we need a left tackle. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=969.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, cool, 15 teams need a left tackle. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=971.36s)]
*  Kelsey, don't even know if he's coming back or not. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=974.04s)]
*  I thought that was pretty ambitious [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=977.32s)]
*  to have them tied with the Ravens. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=980.28s)]
*  The Ravens are 701 too. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=982.72s)]
*  I probably would have had the Ravens [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=983.96s)]
*  as the favorite coming out of the AFC. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=985.36s)]
*  Detroit's down to 901, San Francisco's 12 to one, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=987.2s)]
*  Buffalo plus 750. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=990.8000000000001s)]
*  And then we get into some intriguing teams. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=993.52s)]
*  When you go into like the longer shot, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=996.32s)]
*  like Texans 28 to one kind of jumped out to me. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=999.12s)]
*  A whiff, Vikings 32 to one. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1002.3199999999999s)]
*  If you can make a case for McCarthy to be good next year, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1005.3199999999999s)]
*  but they have a lot of cap space too. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1008.3199999999999s)]
*  Thought that was interesting. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1010.48s)]
*  And then really nobody, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1011.56s)]
*  is there anybody else you were thinking long shot wise [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1014.0799999999999s)]
*  that you're like, I want to see what happens [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1016.36s)]
*  with their draft and free agency [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1017.8s)]
*  and there might be value now? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1019.24s)]
*  The Packers you didn't mention in there, I don't think. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1021.56s)]
*  Did I miss the Packers? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1024.0s)]
*  21 to one Packers. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1025.6s)]
*  Okay, yeah. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1027.56s)]
*  Like they're a team that I think [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1028.56s)]
*  just had sort of a weird year [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1030.0s)]
*  where I think there's a path to them being in the mix [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1031.52s)]
*  and being really good next year. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1034.6s)]
*  Well they're trying to ban the tush push. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1036.3999999999999s)]
*  So they're already like getting on it right now. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1038.12s)]
*  That has made Eagles fans much more angry [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1041.28s)]
*  than anything the Sixers are doing. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1043.48s)]
*  They've turned their wrath to the Packers [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1045.0s)]
*  and they're like, those losers, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1046.9199999999998s)]
*  they want to ban this play that they can't stop. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1048.36s)]
*  So that's interesting. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1050.36s)]
*  And then I think a team that we'll get to here [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1051.3999999999999s)]
*  and talk about quite a bit, the Rams. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1053.08s)]
*  We don't know what they're going to do, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1055.4s)]
*  but if you look at sort of the Eagles Super Bowl path, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1057.64s)]
*  who was the one team that really played them tough [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1061.0s)]
*  in the snow and it came down to the final possession? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1063.68s)]
*  It was the Rams. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1066.44s)]
*  And you can really look at the Rams the last two years [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1067.2800000000002s)]
*  and be like, if you played every season out 10 times, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1069.24s)]
*  there's definitely a scenario [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1072.72s)]
*  where I think they get to the Super Bowl [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1073.8400000000001s)]
*  each of the last two seasons. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1075.96s)]
*  So they're another team that stands out to me [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1077.3600000000001s)]
*  a little bit as well. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1079.44s)]
*  They are so fucked up, everybody who was going [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1080.68s)]
*  against the Eagles the last two rounds, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1082.8000000000002s)]
*  because they really came on like a freight train [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1084.44s)]
*  in that Rams, in the Rams Eagles game. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1086.3600000000001s)]
*  And that was the worst the Eagles looked the whole playoffs [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1089.28s)]
*  just for, you know, that fourth quarter. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1091.3600000000001s)]
*  I brought you on to do a little quarterback roulette. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1095.6000000000001s)]
*  Usually teams, we go into the off season [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1100.1200000000001s)]
*  and teams need quarterbacks, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1102.24s)]
*  but it feels like it's an unusual amount of, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1103.52s)]
*  this could go this way, this could go this way, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1107.1200000000001s)]
*  this could go this way. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1109.3200000000002s)]
*  I wanted to go through all the scenarios, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1111.68s)]
*  but we should start with the Rams [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1113.92s)]
*  before we go through the draft pick teams. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1115.3200000000002s)]
*  The Rams, they have Stafford, they have the 26 pick, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1116.92s)]
*  they have 44.3 million in cap space. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1121.04s)]
*  There's some weird Stafford stuff where if they trade him, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1124.24s)]
*  they take a massive cap hit for this season, right? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1127.96s)]
*  They save like 4 million bucks, something like that, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1131.16s)]
*  but long-term, dead cap 45.3 and they would save 4.3. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1133.3600000000001s)]
*  The new team that takes him, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1140.16s)]
*  he'd count for 27 million, 4 million guaranteed this year [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1142.2s)]
*  and 31 million next year. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1145.16s)]
*  Is it realistic to you that he gets traded? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1146.48s)]
*  We don't usually see this with a team trading [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1148.72s)]
*  an expensive quarterback and taking cap hit, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1151.48s)]
*  and then another team absorbing a big contract. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1153.92s)]
*  Do you see him getting traded? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1156.4s)]
*  I think it's the biggest story in the NFL right now. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1157.96s)]
*  It's the biggest domino to fall. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1160.16s)]
*  And I think it really goes back to last off season [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1161.72s)]
*  where they were at ahead, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1164.3600000000001s)]
*  Matthew Stafford and the Rams with this contract. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1166.0s)]
*  And ultimately the Rams gave in a little bit. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1168.68s)]
*  It didn't happen I think until like the first day [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1171.16s)]
*  of training camp where finally they came to an agreement, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1173.2s)]
*  but it's pretty clear that Matthew Stafford wants [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1175.88s)]
*  to cash in and feels like all this big quarterback money [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1178.3600000000001s)]
*  that's getting paid out there, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1181.64s)]
*  he feels like he's playing better than those guys. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1182.8000000000002s)]
*  And I think Peter Schrager throughout $50 million per year [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1185.0400000000002s)]
*  is what he's seeking. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1188.48s)]
*  So this isn't just like a new thing that's cropped. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1189.52s)]
*  That's what makes me think there's some legs to it [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1191.6000000000001s)]
*  and he could get traded. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1193.64s)]
*  Now having said that, I think- [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1194.96s)]
*  Hold on on the 50 million a year, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1196.5600000000002s)]
*  cause that's, Tu is making that and Hertz is making that. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1198.0800000000002s)]
*  So if I'm Matthew Stafford, I'm like, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1200.88s)]
*  I'm worth 50 million a year. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1202.7600000000002s)]
*  Look at that guy and that guy. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1203.96s)]
*  Yeah. And even last year, Kurt Cousins, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1205.3600000000001s)]
*  often Achilles similar age got $46.5 million per year. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1207.1200000000001s)]
*  So I get that aspect of it. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1211.2s)]
*  And I get the aspect of the Rams saying, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1212.92s)]
*  dude, you're going to be 37 years old. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1214.6000000000001s)]
*  We've paid you a lot of money over the years. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1216.92s)]
*  You're under contract. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1219.6000000000001s)]
*  We can't commit to like three more years of Matthew Stafford [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1220.7600000000002s)]
*  because we just watched Kurt Cousins and Aaron Rodgers [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1223.8400000000001s)]
*  and old quarterbacks around the NFL. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1227.5200000000002s)]
*  When the cliff comes, it comes pretty quickly. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1229.84s)]
*  So I think that's what this is about with the two sides. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1232.28s)]
*  And so I don't know, you know, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1235.28s)]
*  they've given Stafford and his agent permission, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1237.1599999999999s)]
*  Hey, go negotiate with other teams, see what you can get. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1239.12s)]
*  And then the Rams can decide, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1242.0s)]
*  Hey, is that compensation worth it? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1243.36s)]
*  I think what's going to happen is everyone's going to take [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1245.1599999999999s)]
*  a deep breath and the Rams are going to say, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1247.76s)]
*  we are a good team with Matthew Stafford. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1250.72s)]
*  We have a chance to make noise in the playoffs. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1252.6799999999998s)]
*  We want him back. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1254.9199999999998s)]
*  And Stafford's going to say, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1256.12s)]
*  do I want to go chase something with the New York giant? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1257.76s)]
*  It's not going to be as good of a situation [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1261.28s)]
*  wherever he goes. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1263.28s)]
*  And if he's thinking, hey, I want to win. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1264.16s)]
*  I want to have that hall of fame resume, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1266.44s)]
*  maybe when my career is over, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1268.64s)]
*  there's no better situation than Los Angeles. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1270.28s)]
*  So if I'm making a prediction, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1272.68s)]
*  it's that eventually they reach some type of agreement [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1274.04s)]
*  and he's back with the Rams. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1276.76s)]
*  But given that it's the second year in a row [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1278.32s)]
*  and there could be hurt feelings [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1280.44s)]
*  and it could get personal, all those things, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1281.72s)]
*  you never know. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1283.84s)]
*  Well, and there's a lot of posturing through the press, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1284.92s)]
*  which always makes me suspicious. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1287.44s)]
*  The more posturing publicly, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1289.28s)]
*  the more I usually think this is just people [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1290.68s)]
*  rolling up their sleeves, showing some biceps, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1294.68s)]
*  but nothing's actually going to happen. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1296.8400000000001s)]
*  I looked at all the scenarios for trade teams for him. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1298.68s)]
*  And people were mentioning the giants. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1301.0800000000002s)]
*  Like you said, I have no idea why he'd want to do that. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1303.4s)]
*  He already took an insane amount of punishment [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1305.6000000000001s)]
*  when he was on the Lions, the first half of his career. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1307.68s)]
*  He's 37. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1310.2s)]
*  I also think, Kyle, turn the TikTok camera on. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1312.04s)]
*  I think, I was thinking about how LeBron and Brady [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1315.24s)]
*  have ruined our perspective with guys in their late 30s [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1318.32s)]
*  to the point now that, like LeBron looks great. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1322.08s)]
*  I think LeBron might be a second team all NBA guy [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1324.88s)]
*  at this point, the way he's playing [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1327.24s)]
*  and how much he's invested in defense, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1328.8s)]
*  especially the last month and a half, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1331.84s)]
*  where he's been one of the top 10 guys in the league [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1333.52s)]
*  for two months now. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1336.2s)]
*  And then you have Brady playing until he's 45, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1337.64s)]
*  but there's really no other examples. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1339.44s)]
*  You go like, oh, look at Chris Paul. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1341.76s)]
*  He's still doing really well in this part. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1343.52s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, he's 10 and eight. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1345.4s)]
*  I would be so nervous with the Stafford thing. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1348.0s)]
*  So if I'm the Giants, I'm not trading a third pick for him. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1350.76s)]
*  Maybe it's like the third for the Rams, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1355.44s)]
*  have the 26 for the 26 in Stafford. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1358.6000000000001s)]
*  And then I'm using all my cap space for Stafford. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1361.3600000000001s)]
*  Where am I going? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1363.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna be like, I'm in the same division as the Eagles. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1364.44s)]
*  How does that make me better? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1367.52s)]
*  The only team I think makes sense is the Raiders. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1368.72s)]
*  The Raiders have almost a hundred million in cap space. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1373.08s)]
*  They have Carroll. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1375.32s)]
*  They have some blue chippers on both sides. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1376.8s)]
*  I don't think it's inconceivable [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1380.56s)]
*  that they could be pretty good next year [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1382.04s)]
*  if they had Stafford and then, you know, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1384.12s)]
*  didn't give up the sixth pick in the trade. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1386.96s)]
*  Is there any other team? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1388.96s)]
*  Do you like that Raiders fit for him? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1389.84s)]
*  We are 100% on the same page. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1391.72s)]
*  Can we just pour cold water on the Giants thing [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1393.9199999999998s)]
*  a little bit more for a second? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1395.96s)]
*  I'm with you. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1397.56s)]
*  They stink. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1398.3999999999999s)]
*  This is one of the dumbest ideas. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1399.24s)]
*  They would be just making a desperate move [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1401.64s)]
*  to save their jobs. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1403.6s)]
*  And all of a sudden Matthew Stafford's [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1404.68s)]
*  gonna go across the country at 37 years old [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1406.44s)]
*  and they're gonna rebuild their offensive line [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1409.2s)]
*  and they're gonna add more pass catching help [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1411.2s)]
*  and they're gonna improve a defense [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1413.24s)]
*  that was bottom five in the NFL. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1414.56s)]
*  And Stafford's gonna look as good without Sean McBec. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1416.8s)]
*  All those things are gonna happen. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1419.76s)]
*  And this is gonna work out beautifully for the Giants. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1421.24s)]
*  And cold weather instead of a dome. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1422.88s)]
*  Give me a break. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1425.0s)]
*  And the Eagles twice a week or twice a year. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1425.84s)]
*  And Parsons twice a year. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1427.8s)]
*  Come on. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1429.2s)]
*  And Washington. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1430.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1431.7600000000002s)]
*  Terrible idea. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1432.6000000000001s)]
*  So we're on the same page there. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1433.44s)]
*  I thought I was gonna surprise you [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1434.2800000000002s)]
*  with the Raiders is my wild card. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1435.1200000000001s)]
*  That's the one I can see. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1437.0400000000002s)]
*  Because I can see Tom Brady go, like you just said. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1438.3200000000002s)]
*  Dude, Matthew, come here. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1441.3200000000002s)]
*  I can show you some ways to stay healthy, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1442.3200000000002s)]
*  extend your career. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1445.2800000000002s)]
*  You are one of the smartest quarterbacks in the NFL. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1446.8400000000001s)]
*  I don't want these young guys, they're dummies. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1449.2s)]
*  They can't get to the third read on the bat. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1451.0400000000002s)]
*  No, I know you can play quarterback. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1453.16s)]
*  We're gonna bring you in. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1455.0400000000002s)]
*  Pete Carroll, he's like, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1456.3200000000002s)]
*  I'm not trying to rebuild anything here. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1457.64s)]
*  Let's go get a quarterback. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1459.3600000000001s)]
*  I know I can win with right away. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1461.2s)]
*  So I don't love the roster. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1462.72s)]
*  You're probably a little bit higher on the roster [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1464.2s)]
*  maybe than I am. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1465.9199999999998s)]
*  I see like. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1467.08s)]
*  Oh, don't mistake me high on the roster. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1467.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm just saying they have a couple of good players. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1470.32s)]
*  And they have cap space. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1472.36s)]
*  Yeah, they got Brock Bowers, Max Crosby. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1473.6799999999998s)]
*  And then they would need to rebuild things. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1476.04s)]
*  But again, he's playing in a controlled environment. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1477.52s)]
*  Indoors there. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1480.32s)]
*  They have work-ins too. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1481.1599999999999s)]
*  They have three blue chippers. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1481.98s)]
*  Yeah, so they have three guys there. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1483.2s)]
*  So that's the one I looked at. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1484.9199999999998s)]
*  And I thought I could see the Raiders [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1486.32s)]
*  if there's a team that says, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1488.8s)]
*  we're willing to go there. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1490.0s)]
*  50 million a year, two years. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1491.44s)]
*  Let's go, let's win right now. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1494.1200000000001s)]
*  We'll give you maybe a second round pick or whatever [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1495.8400000000001s)]
*  to the Rams. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1498.16s)]
*  And Stafford says, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1499.04s)]
*  hey, Pete Carroll, Tom Brady, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1499.88s)]
*  that sounds pretty good to me. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1502.96s)]
*  I wanna get paid what I'm worth. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1504.44s)]
*  Well, a thing that you and I both love [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1506.04s)]
*  when we're doing the futures in the off season [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1507.96s)]
*  is new coach replacing an incompetent coach, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1509.96s)]
*  which I think is the case here with the Raiders. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1514.04s)]
*  And then way better QB replacing [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1516.44s)]
*  a bunch of shit QBs. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1519.3999999999999s)]
*  They fit that recipe too. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1521.1999999999998s)]
*  And there's some Washington parallels with them. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1523.28s)]
*  And none of us had the balls to pick Washington [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1526.0s)]
*  as a team that could potentially make the NFC title game [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1529.1999999999998s)]
*  or even the playoffs. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1533.0s)]
*  But there was a recipe we all looked at. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1534.7199999999998s)]
*  And we're like, ah man, they need too much help. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1536.6799999999998s)]
*  But they did have the new coach. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1539.1599999999999s)]
*  It was way better than the old coach. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1540.36s)]
*  And the QB that could come in [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1541.9599999999998s)]
*  and potentially be way, way better [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1543.32s)]
*  than what they were getting in QB. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1545.0s)]
*  Both of those things happened. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1546.6s)]
*  They hit some draft picks. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1547.76s)]
*  They hit some free agents. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1548.8s)]
*  I don't feel like the Raiders are that far away [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1550.36s)]
*  from that recipe. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1552.36s)]
*  I don't think the Patriots are either. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1553.24s)]
*  Those are the two teams that I think [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1554.56s)]
*  you have to take seriously. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1556.6399999999999s)]
*  But for them, if they were able to keep that six pick, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1557.48s)]
*  get somebody awesome, trade for Stafford, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1562.12s)]
*  nail one more pick, get two more guys in free agent. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1565.32s)]
*  And all of a sudden you hope the Chiefs go backwards. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1568.68s)]
*  You hope the Chargers kind of stay where they are. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1571.48s)]
*  You kind of, you could talk yourself into it, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1573.52s)]
*  I guess is my point. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1575.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's tough in the AFC. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1577.08s)]
*  Like I don't see a path really for them [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1578.36s)]
*  to get to the Super Bowl. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1580.1999999999998s)]
*  But it's not about that for every team. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1581.4399999999998s)]

*  and have a moment where they've just been [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1587.8799999999999s)]
*  such a beat down franchise? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1589.48s)]
*  I think that is within the realm of possibilities there. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1591.36s)]

*  Minshew and Antonio Pierce, that's five wins. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1597.72s)]

*  They have the first pick of the draft. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1756.48s)]
*  And they have Will Levis, a quarterback, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1758.1000000000001s)]
*  who I think we can all agree, it's not happening. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1759.76s)]
*  There's two separate questions here. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1763.8400000000001s)]
*  Why wouldn't they just take Kam Ward? [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1765.16s)]
*  I know you're starting to do your draft prep. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1767.16s)]
*  People do not think he is the best player in this class. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1769.66s)]
*  I think there's consensus. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1772.72s)]
*  McShea had his great newsletter this weekend. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1774.62s)]
*  Our draft guys are talking about it too. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1777.1399999999999s)]
*  You can say there's either two or three elite players [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1778.6999999999998s)]
*  in the draft, right? [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1781.74s)]
*  Abdul Carter, Travis Hunter, and then I personally, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1783.34s)]
*  and as you know, I don't watch a lot of college football, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1787.22s)]
*  but I've prepped for this draft a lot. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1789.1399999999999s)]
*  It seems like Mason Graham to me is a home run pick [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1791.3s)]
*  and an elite guy. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1794.1s)]
*  So those three guys, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1795.1999999999998s)]
*  Kam Ward is not better than any of them, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1796.3799999999999s)]
*  but QB matters the most. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1797.9399999999998s)]
*  And if you can hit with the guy in the rookie scale, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1800.1999999999998s)]
*  that's the best thing you can do. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1802.6599999999999s)]
*  So two questions. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1805.42s)]
*  Why wouldn't they just take Kam Ward? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1806.26s)]
*  And if they didn't, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1807.46s)]
*  why wouldn't they trade back to a team [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1809.02s)]
*  that wanted to take Kam Ward? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1811.02s)]
*  Because I think he should be the first pick. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1812.62s)]
*  What are your thoughts on that? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1814.54s)]
*  I think the reason why they wouldn't [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1815.78s)]
*  is because teams are kind of overconfident [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1818.5s)]
*  in their ability to evaluate quarterbacks. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1821.58s)]
*  And we see it every year. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1823.74s)]
*  Like this time last year, this time last year, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1824.86s)]
*  we're talking about Jaden Daniels, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1827.14s)]
*  but we're pointing out all the flaws. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1828.82s)]
*  No one, I don't know that anyone had the take [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1830.42s)]
*  that he's gonna come in [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1832.36s)]
*  and turn around the franchise right away and be the guy. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1833.6s)]
*  No one was that confident. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1836.34s)]
*  And we see it year after year [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1837.4399999999998s)]
*  with the way these guys get drafted high, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1838.82s)]
*  they don't pan out. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1841.12s)]
*  Other guys get drafted later in the first round [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1841.96s)]
*  or the second round. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1844.24s)]
*  So I think it's fair to look at Kam Ward [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1845.1399999999999s)]
*  and say there are some questions there, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1847.28s)]
*  but I'm with you. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1849.6399999999999s)]
*  If you see the upside, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1850.56s)]
*  and I think by all accounts, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1852.08s)]
*  the people who have already studied this, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1853.6399999999999s)]
*  and I still have to look at it a little bit closer, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1855.1599999999999s)]
*  but they say he has the tools. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1857.4399999999998s)]
*  He has the upside. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1859.08s)]
*  He has the athletic traits. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1860.08s)]
*  He has the arms. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1861.48s)]
*  So if you have those things, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1862.3200000000002s)]
*  sometimes you just have to take a swing. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1864.0s)]
*  And it's different to take a guy with the first pick [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1865.76s)]
*  than to trade three first round picks [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1868.56s)]
*  to get up to the top five. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1870.48s)]
*  Like if you draft, if you're the Titans, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1871.64s)]
*  you draft Kam Ward, you keep him for two years, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1873.52s)]
*  it's not really working out, he's not the guy. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1876.56s)]
*  You're just sort of back to where you are now, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1879.04s)]
*  but with good players, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1880.76s)]
*  because hopefully you've added pieces to the roster. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1881.92s)]
*  It's not like you're a complete dumpster fire of a franchise [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1884.0800000000002s)]
*  and you have to come up with all these solutions. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1887.48s)]
*  So I think that they should look into taking him [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1889.4s)]
*  if they reach the threshold of, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1891.96s)]
*  hey, he has the upside and we gotta find a quarterback. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1893.3200000000002s)]
*  I'm not convinced that they're going to do that [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1896.44s)]
*  just because they've been a train wreck of an organization. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1898.3600000000001s)]
*  Let's call it what I mean. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1900.8400000000001s)]
*  They can't figure out which way the wind blows, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1901.8400000000001s)]
*  who do they want the GM to be, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1904.2s)]
*  who do they want the coach to be, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1905.48s)]
*  what's their plan, they spend big in free agency. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1906.92s)]
*  So- [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1909.3600000000001s)]
*  Seems like a top five worst owner right now. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1910.2s)]
*  I agree, yes. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1911.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1912.8000000000002s)]
*  Like to be like, yeah, Braybell's not our guy. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1913.64s)]
*  Let me back the GM who I'm gonna fire a year later. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1916.0400000000002s)]
*  That just tells me you don't know what you're doing. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1920.32s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1921.9599999999998s)]
*  So I sort of lean towards them being safer [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1922.8s)]
*  and just drafting the best possible player [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1924.56s)]
*  and maybe saying, hey, Cam Ward's not perfect, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1927.1999999999998s)]
*  so let's go in a different direction. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1929.3999999999999s)]
*  And I wonder if other teams look at Ward [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1931.12s)]
*  and say he's good enough [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1932.8799999999999s)]
*  where we wanna give up draft capital [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1933.8799999999999s)]
*  to move up to number one, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1935.6s)]
*  or maybe we hang tight and see who falls to us. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1937.0s)]
*  So there's two possible moves for them [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1940.9199999999998s)]
*  if it's not Cam Ward. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1942.6799999999998s)]
*  One is you flip picks with the Giants one to three. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1944.6799999999998s)]
*  If you think the Giants are fired up for him [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1947.3999999999999s)]
*  and are worried that they're not gonna get him, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1950.12s)]
*  that he's not gonna fall to three, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1952.36s)]
*  that somebody's gonna trade above them, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1953.4799999999998s)]
*  they just wanna lock it down. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1954.84s)]
*  I mean, would you trade down two spots [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1957.4399999999998s)]
*  if you could get a Giants future first out of it? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1962.3999999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't do it for the second rounder. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1965.9199999999998s)]
*  I think that's too much. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1968.32s)]
*  And the history of the draft is [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1969.3999999999999s)]
*  if you're trading up for a quarterback, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1970.9199999999998s)]
*  you've gotta have another first in the deal. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1973.0s)]
*  That's how it's gone. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1975.4799999999998s)]
*  If I'm the Titans and I need help everywhere [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1977.6s)]
*  and I could go from one to three, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1979.76s)]
*  and I know I'm still getting Carter or Hunter [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1981.8s)]
*  at number three, and I'm getting a Giants pick, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1984.24s)]
*  which I would really want [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1987.36s)]
*  because I don't think they're gonna be good anytime soon, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1988.36s)]
*  I would do that. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1991.1599999999999s)]
*  I don't know if I would do it if I was the Giants [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1992.6s)]
*  because like we discussed earlier, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1994.32s)]
*  I don't know where I'm going if I'm the Giants. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1996.1599999999999s)]
*  I'd probably just, I just want a good player. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=1998.24s)]
*  But that's the only trade that makes sense to me for them. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2001.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I'm with you. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2006.12s)]
*  I think if you're the Titans, I would absolutely do that. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2007.1599999999999s)]
*  Move down two spots and get a future first. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2009.76s)]
*  That'd be smart business. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2012.04s)]
*  The Giants would have to really, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2013.6799999999998s)]
*  now the Giants are an interesting team [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2015.1999999999998s)]
*  because they are in job preservation mode. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2017.12s)]
*  And these are the teams that act the most recklessly [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2018.9799999999998s)]
*  because they don't really care what's happening [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2021.84s)]
*  three years down the road. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2023.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I'm getting fired next year. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2024.76s)]
*  This doesn't work out. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2026.7199999999998s)]
*  My favorite GMs for content, these are the best teams. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2027.9599999999998s)]
*  So maybe they do it. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2030.8s)]
*  I sort of feel like that might even, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2032.4799999999998s)]
*  I don't know that they'll like him that much to say, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2035.8s)]
*  yeah, we'll give up next year's first to move up two spots. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2037.24s)]
*  Yeah, content MVPs, brand new owners [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2040.3600000000001s)]
*  and GMs who need to do something desperate [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2043.64s)]
*  because if it doesn't work out, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2046.52s)]
*  they're getting fired anyway. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2047.7s)]
*  Just the MVPs for 25 years for me. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2049.12s)]
*  I don't really see any other moves up to the one spot [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2052.92s)]
*  unless it was the Raiders and they dangled six [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2056.52s)]
*  and a future first and maybe even took like a bad contract [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2060.88s)]
*  from the Titans because they have the cap space [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2065.8s)]
*  to actually absorb something. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2067.96s)]
*  That's the only other one. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2069.76s)]
*  Like the draft order is Titans, Browns, Giants. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2071.2400000000002s)]
*  The Pats aren't trading up for Cam Ward. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2075.48s)]
*  Jacksonville's not trading up for Cam Ward at number five. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2078.2400000000002s)]
*  So it would really just be the Raiders unless, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2081.04s)]
*  there's a jet scenario that I think [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2084.6s)]
*  there's a more interesting version of this, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2086.84s)]
*  but they have the seventh pick. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2088.36s)]
*  And if Garrett Wilson was on the table [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2091.04s)]
*  and he had the eighth pick to move up to one, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2092.84s)]
*  I'm at least having a meeting about that [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2096.0s)]
*  if I'm the Titans, but I'm probably not doing it. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2097.6000000000004s)]
*  I think the Jets need to be in just relax mode, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2100.6000000000004s)]
*  reset everything. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2103.52s)]
*  I don't think this is the year for them [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2105.0800000000004s)]
*  to take a big swing on something like that [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2107.0800000000004s)]
*  for a quarterback, just kind of rebuild the culture, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2109.36s)]
*  add to the roster and the draft. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2112.0800000000004s)]
*  So that would surprise me a little bit. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2113.7200000000003s)]
*  The Raiders, a lot of sort of links [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2115.52s)]
*  between Shador Sanders and the Raiders [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2118.2000000000003s)]
*  where he and Tom Brady have a relationship. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2121.0s)]
*  He and Mark Davis, I think have a relationship. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2123.12s)]
*  That one's interesting to me. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2125.7599999999998s)]
*  Cause I think, we mentioned Stafford, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2126.88s)]
*  but let's say Stafford's not on the table. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2128.96s)]
*  They might look at it and Pete Carroll's not gonna be afraid [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2130.92s)]
*  to play a young quarterback. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2133.48s)]
*  He's done that before, obviously with Russell Wilson. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2134.6s)]
*  And if Tom Brady's like, no, trust me, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2137.7599999999998s)]
*  I just feel like whoever Tom Brady wants, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2140.2s)]
*  that's gonna be the quarterback of the Raiders. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2142.24s)]
*  Maybe that's wrong, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2144.2s)]
*  but every time I'm looking at some of the options, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2145.68s)]
*  I'm like, Tom Brady's not gonna want Sam Darnold [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2147.56s)]
*  for 30 plus million dollars a year. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2150.4s)]
*  And I'm like, Stafford, I could see it. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2152.2400000000002s)]
*  Shador Sanders, I could see it. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2154.6s)]
*  And then maybe if those don't pan out, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2156.76s)]
*  or are they the Aaron Rodgers team? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2159.88s)]
*  Where again, he would look at it and say, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2163.64s)]
*  you know what, he's a veteran, but he can still play. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2166.2000000000003s)]
*  He's gonna be good in this system. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2168.64s)]
*  So either the Raiders might be the most interesting [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2169.92s)]
*  of any of these teams that need a quarterback. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2172.52s)]
*  We'll go back to that top of the draft. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2175.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm just gonna give everybody the possibilities. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2176.92s)]
*  Here are the quarterback possibilities [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2179.08s)]
*  if you're looking for one. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2180.48s)]
*  Cam Ward, who's gonna be a top four pick. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2182.04s)]
*  Shador Sanders, who I think is going to be, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2185.2799999999997s)]
*  I would say top eight pick, maybe top nine pick. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2187.88s)]
*  He's gonna go in the first nine. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2191.24s)]
*  I just don't know where. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2192.96s)]
*  And we're gonna know, did he go to the combine [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2194.12s)]
*  or did he skip it? [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2196.88s)]
*  I don't think he's participating in the combine. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2198.16s)]
*  Because there's some athleticism stuff with him [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2200.7599999999998s)]
*  that's funny because his dad's DM. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2203.0s)]
*  But I think everyone talks about he's tough, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2204.56s)]
*  he's smart, he processes everything. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2206.6s)]
*  But athletically, he's not actually as athletic [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2208.24s)]
*  as you would think he is. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2210.9199999999996s)]
*  So I'm sure that at some point, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2211.7599999999998s)]
*  people are gonna wanna see it with their own eyes. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2214.2799999999997s)]
*  And then there's the Jackson Dart late first round, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2215.7599999999998s)]
*  early second. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2219.04s)]
*  Could he have like a Bo Nicks rise out of nowhere? [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2221.2s)]
*  That's it for guys who could actually start [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2224.48s)]
*  for a team next year. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2226.64s)]
*  Then you have Stafford. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2227.48s)]
*  We talked about all the cap stuff with him. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2229.12s)]
*  Sam Darnold, Garoppolo, Rogers, Russell Wilson, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2232.3599999999997s)]
*  the corpse of Kirk Cousins, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2238.8799999999997s)]
*  Jameis Winston, Justin Fields, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2240.8799999999997s)]
*  and my guy Joe Milton, who I don't know if you've seen. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2244.96s)]
*  Don't look at who's on Buffalo's team in week 18. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2247.6s)]
*  Just look at what Joe Milton is doing. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2250.6s)]
*  Don't look to see if there are any starters on the field. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2252.2799999999997s)]
*  Joe Milton, is he worth the first round pick? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2254.7999999999997s)]
*  Probably. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2256.8799999999997s)]
*  Eagles version of that is Tanner McKee, by the way. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2259.2s)]
*  There are a couple of those guys who, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2261.6s)]
*  the fan base of that team is like, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2263.64s)]
*  would you take a first for this guy? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2265.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2266.8799999999997s)]
*  You probably want to hold on to him. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2268.56s)]
*  Is there anyone else, I've listed all those QBs, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2270.0s)]
*  is there anyone else you had that is like, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2272.2s)]
*  ah, I can see that guy starting. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2273.8799999999997s)]
*  All right, do you want a little wild card [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2275.56s)]
*  that I don't think is gonna happen? [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2277.0s)]
*  Do I need to buckle up? [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2279.12s)]
*  Should I put my seatbelt on? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2280.08s)]
*  Buckle up a little bit. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2281.2s)]
*  The Pittsburgh Steelers call the Indianapolis Colts [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2283.2s)]
*  and say, we will give you a third round pick [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2287.08s)]
*  for Anthony Richardson, a quarterback who you guys know, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2291.52s)]
*  you don't like him anyway. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2295.24s)]
*  You benched him last year, you brought him back in, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2296.6s)]
*  the vibes were terrible, you want to admit your mistake. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2299.32s)]
*  You know, you're not gonna get a first for him, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2302.68s)]
*  obviously, at this point, and he's been injured [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2304.2s)]
*  and he hasn't done anything yet, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2305.84s)]
*  but we'll give you a third round pick [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2307.16s)]
*  and then you can decide what you want to do as quarterback. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2309.4s)]
*  So Anthony Richardson goes to Pittsburgh [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2312.0s)]
*  under the Mike Tomlin umbrella, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2314.32s)]
*  they get a young quarterback, they get a new culture, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2316.08s)]
*  they run the football with him, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2319.48s)]
*  and the Indianapolis Colts bill, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2321.48s)]
*  they are your Sam Darnold team. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2324.04s)]
*  They say, you know what? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2325.8s)]
*  We're gonna give Sam Darnold $35-ish million per year, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2326.96s)]
*  we're gonna admit our mistake with Anthony Richardson [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2332.0400000000004s)]
*  and take the third round pick, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2334.5600000000004s)]
*  and this is gonna be the trade that shakes up the NFL [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2336.2400000000002s)]
*  this off season, how do we feel? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2338.96s)]
*  So the Colts have $30 million in cap space right now, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2340.88s)]
*  and they have the 14th pick. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2344.0800000000004s)]
*  And if they traded Richardson, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2345.92s)]
*  I would assume there's some sort of cap hit to it, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2348.36s)]
*  but not that much, because he's on a rookie contract, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2350.36s)]
*  so maybe that gets them into Darnold range. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2352.5600000000004s)]
*  What's Darnold worth for you, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2355.8s)]
*  before I tell you whether I like this idea or not? [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2357.5600000000004s)]
*  Because the franchise tag for him would be [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2360.36s)]
*  42.4 million franchise tags, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2365.84s)]
*  because people were thinking, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2369.5200000000004s)]
*  oh, you could see the Vikings franchise, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2370.5200000000004s)]
*  that would be insane for them to do that. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2372.4s)]
*  I personally think they have 60 million in cap space, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2374.92s)]
*  so you're just gonna use all of that to franchise tag them, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2377.92s)]
*  then hope you can trade them? [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2380.6800000000003s)]
*  Why would they do that? [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2382.2400000000002s)]
*  So what's he actually worth, because he's not worth 44? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2383.48s)]
*  Yeah, I'm with you, that's the posturing [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2385.92s)]
*  you mentioned earlier with the Stafford, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2388.32s)]
*  I think that's the Darnold, give me a break, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2390.84s)]
*  they're gonna franchise tag him and then trade him, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2392.56s)]
*  and keep a $40 million cap hold, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2394.68s)]
*  I don't see any team's gonna give up picks. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2396.56s)]
*  We've never seen anyone do that. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2397.4s)]
*  No, I wouldn't see it. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2399.0s)]
*  I think the comp is the Baker Mayfield deal, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2400.12s)]
*  from was it last year or two years ago, [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2403.36s)]
*  where he got, I think it was 33, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2405.44s)]
*  33 and a half million dollars per year, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2407.76s)]
*  it was like a three year, $100 million deal. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2409.68s)]
*  I think that's kind of the best case scenario [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2412.68s)]
*  for Sam Darnold, where if there's a team that says, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2414.92s)]
*  you know what, I know it didn't end well for him, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2417.04s)]
*  but we like him, he can play well for us, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2419.3199999999997s)]
*  we're gonna pay him real starter money, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2421.3599999999997s)]
*  I think that's the number, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2423.2799999999997s)]
*  because the weird thing about the NFL, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2424.3199999999997s)]
*  is there's no kind of middle ground for these contracts, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2426.2799999999997s)]
*  like the only quarterback making between [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2429.04s)]
*  15 and $30 million per year is Geno Smith. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2431.52s)]
*  So it's either you're a bridge quarterback, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2435.56s)]
*  or a backup, and you're under $15 million per year, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2437.96s)]
*  or it's no, we believe in you as our starter, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2441.52s)]
*  and you're making between 30 and $60 million per year. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2444.16s)]
*  It's almost like Hollywood actors, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2447.64s)]
*  where you have like, you have your Tom Cruise types, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2450.48s)]
*  and then you drop like majorly to the next level of like, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2454.2s)]
*  yeah, we can put that guy in a poster, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2459.04s)]
*  but it does, you know, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2461.4s)]
*  you don't really have to spend a lot of money for it. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2462.6s)]
*  I personally think 30 million for Darnold's too high, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2465.56s)]
*  but I can't shake the last two games. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2468.36s)]
*  I don't know how you get past that, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2473.1600000000003s)]
*  if you're running a team and you're thinking about, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2474.6400000000003s)]
*  if the goal is to actually try to win the Super Bowl, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2477.52s)]
*  there might be some other teams that just, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2479.84s)]
*  their goal would be competency, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2482.4s)]
*  and then maybe it makes sense, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2484.8s)]
*  but you know, Mayfield, at least Mayfield had done, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2486.1200000000003s)]
*  you know, he had pulled the Browns, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2490.08s)]
*  he'd won a playoff game, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2491.44s)]
*  there was some sort of history, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2492.56s)]
*  and then he had a really good comeback year, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2494.44s)]
*  and there was some stuff you could point to, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2496.04s)]
*  I don't know, I'd be really nervous about that. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2498.2799999999997s)]
*  So you think Colts potentially for him, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2501.84s)]
*  I don't see it with the Raiders, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2504.64s)]
*  the Steelers would be the other one, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2507.32s)]
*  just cause they have the cap space, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2509.84s)]
*  and if they could get him and sell him on the culture [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2512.2s)]
*  and be like 60 million for three years, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2514.6s)]
*  make them a $20 million guy, maybe? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2516.72s)]
*  Yeah, you seem suspicious. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2521.04s)]
*  I look at it, and yeah, my Richardson trade [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2522.8s)]
*  was more team content, and I don't expect that to happen, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2526.36s)]
*  I'm with you, so I think you look at it, [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2529.36s)]
*  the Steelers, when I was just going through all the teams, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2531.36s)]
*  they were one of the teams left, where I said, [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2533.6000000000004s)]
*  okay, I don't have a place for Sam Darnold, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2535.2000000000003s)]
*  so in that sense, I could see it. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2537.5600000000004s)]
*  Is he the type of guy Mike Tomlin wants though? [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2539.84s)]
*  You know, like he's gonna probably turn the book all over. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2542.28s)]
*  I don't know what Mike, what is Mike Tomlin, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2544.1600000000003s)]
*  Mike Tomlin's like your buddy who just dates [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2545.5600000000004s)]
*  all kinds of girls, you have no idea what his type is. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2547.36s)]
*  He's been all over the map. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2550.76s)]
*  Think of all the QBs, they've runnin' it out of there. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2552.88s)]
*  He's tryin' to tuck himself into Trubisky, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2555.6s)]
*  you know, is he Russell Wilson, great, Justin Fields, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2558.0s)]
*  does he have a type? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2561.28s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's a good point, you're right, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2562.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't know what it is, so I don't know that [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2565.2400000000002s)]
*  they would wanna pay that kind of money for Sam Darnold. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2567.44s)]
*  Would they rather just take a one-year flyer on somebody, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2570.32s)]
*  are they in Aaron Rodgers' team, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2573.48s)]
*  potentially, the Steelers, where they say. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2575.36s)]
*  Can I ask you this, are you in Aaron Rodgers' team? [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2577.1600000000003s)]
*  Would you wanna do a year with Aaron Rodgers? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2579.32s)]
*  I'm out, there's no way I'm goin' near that dude. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2581.84s)]
*  And from what we saw last year, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2585.04s)]
*  he doesn't wanna get hit anymore, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2586.5600000000004s)]
*  he doesn't have legs anymore, like I just don't see it. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2587.7200000000003s)]
*  I agree, and all the stuff that comes with it, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2590.96s)]
*  I would want nothing to do with it. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2592.88s)]
*  The Steelers kinda just sit back and look at who's left there, [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2594.6000000000004s)]
*  so that's why I threw them out there for him. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2597.76s)]
*  Would the Titans, if they don't draft a quarterback at one, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2599.96s)]
*  who's playing quarterback for the Titans? [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2603.7200000000003s)]
*  Would they look at Sam Darnold or somebody like Derek Carr [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2605.48s)]
*  and say, let's just get sort of a short-term option [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2608.92s)]
*  for a couple years while we build up the roster? [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2611.96s)]
*  Derek Carr, I'm out. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2613.56s)]
*  All right, I'm blind out. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2614.4s)]
*  Can I throw a name at you that I feel like his stock [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2617.4s)]
*  is too far down compared to what it should be? [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2621.0s)]
*  Garoppolo. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2623.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2625.92s)]
*  So, terrible Raiders year, right? [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2626.76s)]
*  Immortalized in the Devonte Adams wide receiver show, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2628.96s)]
*  just him being pissed off the whole year. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2632.36s)]
*  But we've also seen, he's had success, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2634.92s)]
*  there was a while where the biggest criticism for him [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2637.2s)]
*  would be like, well, when he's on the field, he's good, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2639.72s)]
*  but he keeps getting hurt. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2642.92s)]
*  He keeps getting dinged up. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2645.08s)]
*  He takes hits. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2646.16s)]
*  It's the durability would be the question for him. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2647.0s)]
*  And now we've moved into this phase of, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2649.88s)]
*  he's just not good at quarterback. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2651.52s)]
*  And I'm not sure I believe that because, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2652.96s)]
*  the Niners came pretty close to winning a Super Bowl with him, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2656.4s)]
*  which is a lot more than we could say about anyone else [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2659.68s)]
*  we're talking about on this list, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2662.24s)]
*  except Rogers, who's washed up. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2663.44s)]
*  And I'm just like, if I'm gonna pay 30 million for Sam Darnold, [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2665.8s)]
*  I would kind of rather pay 5 million for Garoppolo [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2670.2000000000003s)]
*  and try to build an offensive line around him [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2673.4s)]
*  so he's not taking big hits [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2675.96s)]
*  and do that because I've seen him do it before. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2678.0800000000004s)]
*  I don't think he can do it if he doesn't have a line, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2681.0s)]
*  but if you're actually blocking for him, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2682.7200000000003s)]
*  it's not inconceivable to me that he'd be good. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2686.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2690.0s)]
*  You agree or disagree? [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2690.84s)]
*  No, I think you're right. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2691.6800000000003s)]
*  If you have the infrastructure in place, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2692.5200000000004s)]
*  I think the problem with a lot of these teams [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2694.68s)]
*  we're talking about and look at, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2696.8399999999997s)]
*  do they have a good offensive line? [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2698.96s)]
*  Do they have good wide receivers? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2700.8399999999997s)]
*  Do they have a good play caller? [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2702.2799999999997s)]
*  Now you could have those caveats [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2703.52s)]
*  for a lot of the quarterbacks we're discussing here as well, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2704.8399999999997s)]
*  but I do agree with you. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2707.64s)]
*  I would rather take a flyer on Jimmy Garoppolo [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2708.6s)]
*  for under 10 million than commit to Sam Darnold [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2710.8399999999997s)]
*  on that Baker Mayfield contract [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2713.8799999999997s)]
*  than to have all the stuff that comes with Aaron Rogers [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2715.48s)]
*  at this age. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2719.12s)]
*  I would rather just buy some time [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2719.96s)]
*  because I think you're right, [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2721.96s)]
*  when he's on the field, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2722.8s)]
*  he will give you a baseline level of competency [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2723.92s)]
*  where you will be able to run your offense, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2726.7200000000003s)]
*  your other players will get their touches, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2729.28s)]
*  you build up the roster, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2731.32s)]
*  and then you see where you're at a year from now. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2732.6400000000003s)]
*  So yeah, I don't think that's a wrong way to look at it. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2734.4s)]
*  The Rams, would they, [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2737.32s)]
*  if they were to trade Matthew Stafford, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2739.0s)]
*  would they just say, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2741.6800000000003s)]
*  hey, Garoppolo has been here, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2742.52s)]
*  let's do a year with Garoppolo [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2744.1400000000003s)]
*  and then we'll figure it out after that? [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2745.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, like if the Seahawks chaired at Gino, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2747.2400000000002s)]
*  which we'll talk about in a second, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2749.7200000000003s)]
*  and they were like, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2751.52s)]
*  we're gonna bring in Jimmy, cheaper price. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2752.36s)]
*  I'd be like, that's a bad idea, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2755.56s)]
*  you guys can't block. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2756.8s)]
*  Like Jimmy's gonna just take a lot of hits [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2758.6s)]
*  and run for his life [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2760.32s)]
*  and he's gonna suck like he did on the Raiders. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2761.16s)]
*  But if it was a team that had a little more stability, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2762.92s)]
*  like I actually think the Steelers, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2765.72s)]
*  if they can get their offensive line healthy next year, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2767.64s)]
*  it's a good offensive line potentially, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2770.04s)]
*  they've certainly invested in it. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2772.08s)]
*  And he seems like more of a Steeler type to me. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2773.4s)]
*  Going backwards, Brown's at two, [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2776.22s)]
*  no QB and Watson out for the year of the Achilles thing. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2779.98s)]
*  This is another team, it's like, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2784.22s)]
*  why wouldn't they take Cam Ward [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2785.54s)]
*  if he was sitting there at two? [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2786.8599999999997s)]
*  They're never gonna have another chance [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2788.4199999999996s)]
*  to sign a QB, trade for one, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2789.94s)]
*  they're in this Watson hell. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2792.2799999999997s)]
*  And everyone's like, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2795.48s)]
*  well, do you see them take Hunter or Carter? [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2796.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't understand why they wouldn't take a quarterback [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2798.7s)]
*  if they liked Ward, why wouldn't they? [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2800.74s)]
*  I'm with you with these teams. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2803.22s)]
*  Like you only get so many chances at drafting a quarterback [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2804.98s)]
*  and it's not that the likelihood is high [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2807.9s)]
*  that you're gonna hit, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2809.94s)]
*  but it's what happens if you do actually hit. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2810.9s)]
*  It totally changes you. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2813.1800000000003s)]
*  And especially for a team like this, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2814.5800000000004s)]
*  that is in Capel, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2816.42s)]
*  that has signed the worst contract of any player [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2817.82s)]
*  in NFL history with Deshaun Watson [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2820.1400000000003s)]
*  and there's no way out of it. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2821.9s)]
*  Like I see the rumors that, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2823.34s)]
*  hey, go get Kirk Cousins. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2824.98s)]
*  I mean, where does that leave you? [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2827.2200000000003s)]
*  37 year old Kirk Cousins and then- [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2829.5s)]
*  Much rather have Garoppolo than Kirk Cousins. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2831.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so- [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2834.1000000000004s)]
*  Kirk Cousins I think is gonna retire [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2834.94s)]
*  and be on TV next year would be my prediction for him. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2836.4s)]
*  Interesting, maybe, yeah. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2838.56s)]
*  Cause he's getting paid either way. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2840.2400000000002s)]
*  He's getting most of the Atlanta money. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2841.44s)]
*  Why does he wanna keep playing? [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2843.2400000000002s)]
*  He's had a great life, he's made a bunch of money [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2844.92s)]
*  and he'll be an immediate, [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2847.08s)]
*  I think like an aggressive TV candidate. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2849.48s)]
*  Okay, I like that. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2852.6400000000003s)]
*  I hadn't thought about that. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2853.84s)]
*  I was looking at where Kirk Cousins might end up, [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2854.8s)]
*  but I'm with you. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2856.88s)]
*  Basically we're on the same page [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2857.7200000000003s)]
*  with the teams at the top of the draft. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2858.84s)]
*  I think too often teams are like, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2860.6800000000003s)]
*  this isn't an Andrew Luck type prospect. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2862.32s)]
*  This isn't whoever, we can't take them. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2865.08s)]
*  Cause it goes back to the job security thing. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2868.04s)]
*  Cause they're like, if we miss on this, [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2870.64s)]
*  we're not going to get a chance [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2872.48s)]
*  to draft another quarterback. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2873.88s)]
*  I do think that's a big deal. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2875.2s)]
*  We talked about the Eagles at the top, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2876.52s)]
*  like how we Roseman can make mistakes. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2878.3199999999997s)]
*  They signed Bryce Huff last year for $17 million per year [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2880.68s)]
*  and he was inactive in the Superbowl. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2884.6s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2886.48s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2887.3199999999997s)]
*  He's allowed to take those risks. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2888.16s)]
*  They had Carson Wentz on a huge deal [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2890.04s)]
*  and they were able to trade him. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2891.84s)]
*  Other organizations that don't have stability, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2893.16s)]
*  their GMs are making decisions based on, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2895.72s)]
*  is this potentially going to get me fired? [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2898.44s)]
*  And they can't get that out of their head [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2900.4s)]
*  where if you had a guy who knew he had the job [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2902.0s)]
*  for the next 15, 20 years, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2903.88s)]
*  I bet they'd be more likely to say, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2905.56s)]
*  hey, Cam Ward's not perfect, but we kind of like him. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2906.96s)]
*  Let's take a flyer on this. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2910.08s)]
*  Cause look at what the other options are. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2911.3599999999997s)]
*  It's such an important point. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2913.88s)]
*  The psychology of the people making the decision [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2915.8399999999997s)]
*  never gets factored into these mock drafts. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2918.56s)]
*  If I'm running the Titans [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2921.16s)]
*  or if I'm running the Browns [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2922.48s)]
*  and I don't take Cam Ward [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2924.56s)]
*  and then he goes to the Giants at three and he's awesome. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2927.4s)]
*  I'm getting fired. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2930.28s)]
*  If I take Cam Ward, I'm buying two years. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2932.6s)]
*  I'm in the same spot like with Griggson [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2935.72s)]
*  and on the Colts with Richardson. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2937.6s)]
*  Where you take the guy, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2940.04s)]
*  you're not really going to get criticized [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2942.0s)]
*  no matter what happens for two years. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2943.52s)]
*  And there's always the illusion of hope [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2945.32s)]
*  with the QB you took, right? [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2947.04s)]
*  So with Cam Ward, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2948.6s)]
*  I'm buying the illusion of hope for two years. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2949.96s)]
*  I now I'm secure with my job. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2952.56s)]
*  Same thing if the Giants were able to get him at three. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2953.88s)]
*  That's why I think there's no scenario [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2956.0s)]
*  where he's not one of the top three picks. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2957.68s)]
*  And I'd be really surprised. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2959.7999999999997s)]
*  I just, I don't understand why the Browns would pass on him [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2961.84s)]
*  when they are just completely fucked [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2964.36s)]
*  with this Watson thing. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2966.2s)]
*  And I also think like, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2968.7999999999997s)]
*  is it inconceivable Ward could go one [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2970.44s)]
*  and Sanders could go two? [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2972.3199999999997s)]
*  And we'd be like, oh my God, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2973.52s)]
*  we've seen Mitch Trubisky go second in a draft. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2975.08s)]
*  Like the closer you get to these drafts, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2977.44s)]
*  like everybody thinks Cam Ward isn't as good [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2980.2s)]
*  as the top three quarterbacks in last year's draft, right? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2982.72s)]
*  They don't even maybe think he's as good [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2985.7599999999998s)]
*  as Pennex was last year. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2987.7599999999998s)]
*  But when you're in these drafts and people need quarterbacks, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2989.68s)]
*  all of a sudden the value just skyrockets [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2992.48s)]
*  for these stupid reasons. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2994.3999999999996s)]
*  I think the Browns, they're so screwed. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2996.12s)]
*  I don't know how they don't take a quarterback with one. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=2999.08s)]
*  Like, oh cool, we have Travis Hunter. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3001.16s)]
*  Great, I have nobody to throw the ball to him. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3002.9199999999996s)]
*  And our defense is going to be in the field all the time. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3005.0s)]
*  I'll probably get hurt. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3007.3599999999997s)]
*  Giants at three. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3008.52s)]
*  No QB except Drew Lock, third pick, 38.7 million cap space. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3009.92s)]
*  And this seems like another QB spot for me. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3014.6s)]
*  There's a pot, like could you trade three [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3019.7200000000003s)]
*  for Stafford in 26? [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3021.8s)]
*  You could, as we covered, I don't know how it makes sense. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3023.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think their best case scenario is to stay put [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3026.6s)]
*  and those quarterbacks don't go one and two. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3030.0s)]
*  And you take a quarterback, they're like the team [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3032.88s)]
*  that has to, they have to make a move. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3035.4s)]
*  I don't even think they have a quarterback [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3037.32s)]
*  on the roster right now. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3039.0s)]
*  And they're not going to be like, oh, let's sign a bridge guy [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3040.24s)]
*  like Garoppolo again for what we just talked about [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3042.6s)]
*  because there are jobs on the line. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3045.16s)]
*  So they have to take a swing. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3046.88s)]
*  They seem like the KM Ward team if he doesn't go one or two. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3048.4s)]
*  And if he does, I think you have to maybe look [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3052.56s)]
*  at Shador Sanders there. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3054.88s)]
*  It could be a Russell Wilson team too. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3056.72s)]
*  Like there's a case for Russell Wilson for a team like that [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3059.08s)]
*  where you say, hey, you made the playoffs last year. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3062.28s)]
*  He's pretty good for the Steelers, right? [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3066.04s)]
*  We get him for cheap because he's still being, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3068.32s)]
*  he's still on that giant contract. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3070.2000000000003s)]
*  He's in New York. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3071.92s)]
*  He knows how to handle the city. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3072.76s)]
*  You can talk to yourself in the network. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3073.84s)]
*  We're going to suck anyway. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3075.2000000000003s)]
*  Why am I spending money on a quarterback [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3076.1600000000003s)]
*  if I'm not drafting one? [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3078.0s)]
*  Raiders at six. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3079.8s)]
*  Six pick, 99.5 million cap space. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3083.4s)]
*  There was stuff online as we were taping this morning [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3085.84s)]
*  about Pete Carroll talking to the Seahawks guy. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3088.4s)]
*  A lot of people wonder if Gino might get traded. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3093.6400000000003s)]
*  What is Gino worth to you? [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3098.32s)]
*  Like, let's say the Raiders are like, Gino's our guy. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3101.28s)]
*  We're going to get him. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3103.48s)]
*  We're going to give him a new contract. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3104.84s)]
*  This is the guy we want. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3106.1200000000003s)]
*  He's competent enough. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3107.6800000000003s)]
*  He can throw the ball. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3109.1600000000003s)]
*  He's had some success. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3110.48s)]
*  This is who we like. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3112.6800000000003s)]
*  Is it a second round pick for Gino? [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3113.96s)]
*  Is it, we'll give you the six for Gino in the 18. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3115.92s)]
*  What's the trade? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3119.36s)]
*  My initial gut went to second round pick. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3121.56s)]
*  I don't think you're getting a first round pick [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3124.28s)]
*  for Gino Smith at his age. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3126.44s)]
*  You're also going to have to redo his contract. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3128.84s)]
*  So you're making a financial commitment to him. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3130.6s)]
*  He's going into the final year of his deal. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3132.64s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3134.7599999999998s)]
*  Sixth for Gino in 18. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3135.6s)]
*  Would you do that if you're the Seahawks? [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3139.16s)]
*  And then you use the money and you sign, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3140.92s)]
*  I don't know, Sam Darnold? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3143.3199999999997s)]
*  I wouldn't do that if I were the Seahawks. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3145.04s)]
*  I don't think I would either. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3146.7599999999998s)]
*  How about this? [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3148.24s)]
*  I wouldn't trade Gino Smith if I were the Seahawks. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3149.08s)]
*  I wouldn't either. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3151.04s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't either. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3151.88s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3152.72s)]
*  How about this? [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3153.56s)]
*  Draft an offensive line for him. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3154.4s)]
*  Add a couple of people who can block. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3155.24s)]
*  I mean, you lost last year. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3158.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's true. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3160.36s)]
*  I mean, if they had a great off season [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3161.68s)]
*  where they were able to upgrade just the offensive line [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3163.16s)]
*  and not do anything else, [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3166.92s)]
*  we might be on here in August saying, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3168.84s)]
*  hey, we like the Seahawks to win the NFC West. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3170.44s)]
*  I mean, they won 10 games last year [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3172.48s)]
*  with a bad offensive line, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3174.48s)]
*  with a defensive coach implementing a system [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3176.12s)]
*  for the first time. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3178.6s)]
*  I think their defense is going to be pretty good next year. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3179.64s)]
*  So I'm with you. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3182.08s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if they give him an extension. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3182.92s)]
*  In terms of an extension for Gino, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3185.04s)]
*  the floor is probably that Baker Mayfield deal [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3187.2799999999997s)]
*  we talked about, 33 million per year. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3189.3599999999997s)]
*  But he might look at it and go, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3191.72s)]
*  give me a break. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3192.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm playing better, like you said, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3193.68s)]
*  behind this offensive line, the salary cap has gone up. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3195.3599999999997s)]
*  I want over $40 million per year. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3198.7599999999998s)]
*  And then at his age in his mid 30s, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3200.8799999999997s)]
*  if you're the Seahawks, are you comfortable doing that? [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3202.9199999999996s)]
*  He's like, look at all my come from behind wins. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3205.2s)]
*  And then they're like, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3207.2s)]
*  let's throw in the Cardinals tape [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3208.08s)]
*  of some of the throws you made in that game. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3209.8399999999997s)]
*  Jets at seven. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3213.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh, by the way, with the Raiders, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3215.84s)]
*  we feel like Stafford is a real possibility there. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3218.08s)]
*  That's our favorite Raiders move, right? [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3220.6400000000003s)]
*  Or taking Sanders. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3222.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3224.6400000000003s)]
*  There's one more Sanders piece [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3225.48s)]
*  that I forgot to mention during the Raiders part. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3228.2400000000002s)]
*  If Sanders is at four for the Patriots, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3231.92s)]
*  I don't know why they wouldn't flip picks with them [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3236.52s)]
*  at that point. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3238.56s)]
*  If the Patriots, Sanders is still there [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3239.4s)]
*  and the Patriots signal, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3241.7200000000003s)]
*  we're trading out of this pick [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3245.52s)]
*  because we have a bunch of people that want Sanders. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3247.44s)]
*  You could just move up and take them. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3249.56s)]
*  But give us your first next year. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3252.36s)]
*  Four and six. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3256.1600000000003s)]
*  We'll flip. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3258.32s)]
*  Give us next year's first. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3259.2000000000003s)]
*  And we'll throw in our third round pick next year. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3260.76s)]
*  I'm doing that in five seconds if I'm the Pats. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3264.0s)]
*  If you're the Pats, yes. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3267.2400000000002s)]
*  These quarterbacks, I don't know that the league [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3269.1200000000003s)]
*  thinks as highly of them that they would say, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3271.0s)]
*  I'm giving up a future first. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3272.7200000000003s)]
*  I think there's a trade there to be made. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3273.96s)]
*  Move from four to six. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3275.64s)]
*  So second? [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3276.48s)]
*  Would you do four and six for the second? [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3277.32s)]
*  Something like that, sure. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3279.36s)]
*  I would think about something like that. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3280.84s)]
*  I mean, when we're doing these, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3282.8s)]
*  it's like, yeah, who would say no? [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3284.6800000000003s)]
*  The Patriots, I think, are still saying yes to that. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3286.84s)]
*  Whereas the other team, the Raiders might be like, [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3289.16s)]
*  I still don't know if I want to go that high. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3292.76s)]
*  But yeah, I think if they like Sanders [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3295.04s)]
*  and they want to go get him, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3296.88s)]
*  I would have no issue with them making a move like that. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3297.96s)]
*  Yeah, because if they're at six [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3300.52s)]
*  and they're basically talking themselves into Mason Graham [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3302.48s)]
*  or the best left tackle at that point, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3305.12s)]
*  who unfortunately, people aren't positive he's a left tackle, [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3308.12s)]
*  which makes me nervous. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3312.08s)]
*  Will Campbell, it's like, no, he's almost definitely a tackle, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3313.0s)]
*  but he does have short arms. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3316.64s)]
*  He might be a guard. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3317.68s)]
*  It's like, well, if he might be a guard, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3318.52s)]
*  I'm not taking him in the top six. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3319.76s)]
*  I'm just not. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3321.2000000000003s)]
*  You can't spend a top six pick [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3322.2400000000002s)]
*  on somebody who might be a guard. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3324.2400000000002s)]
*  I like him. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3325.88s)]
*  I mean, he literally played left tackle in the SEC. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3326.7200000000003s)]
*  And then we start measuring the arm length [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3329.76s)]
*  and I'm like, no, he's not going to play. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3331.68s)]
*  I like him too. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3332.96s)]
*  Do I have to take him with the fourth pick? [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3333.7999999999997s)]
*  Do I have to take him with the sixth pick? [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3335.3599999999997s)]
*  Can I just move down and take him at nine? [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3337.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3340.3999999999996s)]
*  Jets seven, no QB, seventh pick, 11.2 million in cap space. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3342.44s)]
*  Another possible Sanders spot. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3346.48s)]
*  Can I just, can I test drive you through [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3348.64s)]
*  Pat's trade the four to the Jets for Wilson in the seven [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3352.24s)]
*  scenario, just for fun, just for shits and giggles? [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3356.12s)]
*  Can you give me a who says no on that one? [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3360.0s)]
*  I got, I know I got Nephi Kyle's attention. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3361.88s)]
*  Jets are a no. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3365.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, Garrett Wilson on his own traded, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3366.08s)]
*  I believe would get a first round pick in return. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3368.92s)]
*  If you look at wide receivers, I mean, AJ brought all these [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3372.08s)]
*  guys who got traded in the last five years who have been [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3374.36s)]
*  young wide receivers who are very good get first round picks. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3377.36s)]
*  So I didn't say it was a fair trade for the Jets. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3381.88s)]
*  I just wanted to walk you through the scenario. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3383.96s)]
*  What about four and, and our third, which is high up in the [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3387.1600000000003s)]
*  third round for seven and Wilson, is that more interesting [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3394.1600000000003s)]
*  to you and the Jets take Sanders still not it. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3397.84s)]
*  I'm not doing that. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3401.2000000000003s)]
*  We have to put our second in that for you to do it. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3402.04s)]
*  Yes. And even that, like if I'm the Jets, I, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3406.76s)]
*  why am I trading Garrett Wilson? [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3409.84s)]
*  Like we're like, Hey, we know he's miserable. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3411.2400000000002s)]
*  He doesn't want to be a jet anymore. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3413.56s)]
*  Listen, this is why you hire. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3415.4s)]
*  Come to Drake, bang, come to Drake, bang, get him, get [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3416.52s)]
*  Aaron Glenn in a room with him and he may change this to him [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3420.52s)]
*  that this is that's why you hire Aaron Glenn to get through [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3423.76s)]
*  to some of these guys who have just been like, man, it has [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3426.1200000000003s)]
*  been miserable being a jet. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3428.56s)]
*  Well, it's not going to be miserable anymore. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3429.88s)]
*  So I wouldn't trade number one wide receivers on rookie contracts. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3431.7200000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3435.4s)]
*  Seventh pick in the draft. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3436.96s)]
*  Does Sanders fall below seven? [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3439.2400000000002s)]
*  Cause I don't see how the Jets don't take them at seven. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3441.48s)]
*  I don't see any scenario where that doesn't happen. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3443.8s)]
*  I don't think he falls below six. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3446.88s)]
*  I sort of feel like if he's there when the Raiders draft, yeah. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3448.4s)]
*  So I'm with you. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3451.4s)]
*  I don't think it's interesting. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3452.1200000000003s)]
*  So we definitely have Hunter Carter who now they're talking [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3453.36s)]
*  about our shoulders, not a hundred percent, which could [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3457.96s)]
*  knock them out of the number one pick. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3460.0s)]
*  Come to the Patriots, be our Willie McGinnis of this generation. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3461.6400000000003s)]
*  Uh, Carter Hunter Graham, the two QBs. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3465.6800000000003s)]
*  And then it gets like, when you start talking about like, who do [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3472.12s)]
*  you think is going to be the six pick in this draft or in that top six, [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3474.8s)]
*  you'll get different answers from different people. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3479.92s)]
*  Some people would say it's Campbell might be the cornerback from Michigan. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3481.96s)]
*  Um, so for the Jets, like if they're just sitting there and both [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3485.6s)]
*  quarterbacks are gone at that point, they're just, they're taking anybody. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3488.8s)]
*  A couple more teams, saints. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3492.4s)]
*  They have the ninth pick, no cap space and Derek Carr and Spencer Rattler. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3494.32s)]
*  Good luck. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3497.92s)]
*  Uh, no ability to trade. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3499.2s)]
*  No ability to really do anything. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3500.92s)]
*  Colts we mentioned whether they move on from Richardson or not. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3502.56s)]
*  Steelers, no QB whatsoever. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3507.04s)]
*  21st pick, 60.2 million in cap space. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3508.96s)]
*  I'm not saying they're not a Stafford team. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3513.12s)]
*  They could fit the contract in. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3517.84s)]
*  Would you trade the 21st pick for Stafford if you're the Steelers? [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3520.16s)]
*  You have to feel like you could win the title if you're doing that. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3524.32s)]
*  It's a good one. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3528.0s)]
*  It was another one. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3528.7200000000003s)]
*  It's a good one. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3529.64s)]
*  It was another name that I had written down for him. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3530.44s)]
*  I would have to think strongly about doing that if I'm the Steelers, when you [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3533.56s)]
*  look at their quarterback situation in recent years and like you said, they [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3537.2s)]
*  made the playoffs last year with it's not like they have a terrible team. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3540.52s)]
*  They had a good defense. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3544.44s)]
*  Uh, you know, things fell apart. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3545.6s)]
*  Hey, idiots like me were saying they were the best team in the AFC at the end of [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3546.8799999999997s)]
*  November, they really looked that way. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3550.2s)]
*  And then they completely died. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3551.7599999999998s)]
*  And I have, we found TJ Watts body yet. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3553.08s)]
*  What happened to him? [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3555.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3556.3199999999997s)]
*  Where'd he go? [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3556.72s)]
*  So offensively, it's not the greatest spot for Stafford when you look at just [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3558.7599999999998s)]
*  kind of the supporting cast, but you have pickings, maybe you can add a piece in, [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3563.3599999999997s)]
*  in the draft here in the, uh, later rounds. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3567.3999999999996s)]
*  I would have to think about that if I were the Steelers and given their other options. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3569.8399999999997s)]
*  Would you trade 21 for Geno Smith? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3573.48s)]
*  Wow. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3578.08s)]
*  I actually think if I'm the Steelers. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3579.72s)]
*  I like that. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3582.72s)]
*  I would do that. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3583.24s)]
*  I think I would too. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3584.08s)]
*  I think I would do it. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3585.08s)]
*  I'm pro Geno. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3586.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3587.44s)]
*  Uh, a couple more teams and then we'll go. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3588.2s)]
*  The Niners, Purdy, one more year left on this deal, but this is the time when you [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3589.88s)]
*  blow up the deal, you give them the giant extension and you kind of have to decide. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3596.3199999999997s)]
*  How much is Brock Purdy worth? [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3601.16s)]
*  Um, probably more than a Mayfield contract, maybe less than a Tua contract, [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3602.72s)]
*  but Tua got the contract he did. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3607.88s)]
*  And that made me think he's probably worth the Tua contract. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3609.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3613.0s)]
*  I say more than the Tua contract. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3613.2s)]
*  I mean, [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3614.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh Jesus. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3615.16s)]
*  Really? [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3615.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3616.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3616.4s)]
*  I, I, I, if I'm Purdy, maybe this, I mean, if Tua is getting $53 million per year [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3616.72s)]
*  and now the cap has gone up, how are you taking anything under, under [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3622.96s)]
*  than like 55 million per year? [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3626.2s)]
*  I mean, that's just what the price is for. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3628.0s)]
*  Quarterback Tua is not better than Purdy. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3630.2s)]
*  I don't think. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3631.88s)]
*  But they have the leverage of how about you take 85% of that Tua deal and then [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3632.92s)]
*  you have the security, whatever happens this season, you know, you have the contract. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3639.08s)]
*  What if this season goes badly? [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3643.08s)]
*  This is a pretty big financial decision. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3645.44s)]
*  You're locking it up. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3647.12s)]
*  Do it now. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3648.24s)]
*  That would be the psychology you try to use against them, I guess. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3649.7599999999998s)]
*  Like look at what happened to you the second half of last season. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3652.68s)]
*  You fell apart. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3655.36s)]
*  We're not going to have Debo Samuel next year. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3656.04s)]
*  God only knows how long we're going to have McCaffrey. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3658.04s)]
*  God only knows how long Trump William's going to be healthy. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3660.36s)]
*  Like, you sure you don't want this now? [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3662.7999999999997s)]
*  I guess, but I think with the agents, I would be like, okay, cool. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3667.7599999999998s)]
*  I'll play out the final year of my deal. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3671.7599999999998s)]
*  Then you're going to tag me next year for what? [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3673.64s)]
*  $45 million per year. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3675.48s)]
*  You're not going to be able to make any other moves. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3676.92s)]
*  And then after that, I'm a free agent at the age of what he's going to be in his late [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3679.0s)]
*  twenties, and I just saw what Kirk Cousins got on the open market. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3683.28s)]
*  So unless I have a career ending injury, I'm going to be just fine with that. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3686.12s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3690.0s)]
*  I think that's probably the floor. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3690.84s)]
*  Now they could wait. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3692.4s)]
*  The 49ers could wait, say play out the final year of your deal, maybe tag him. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3693.44s)]
*  Just you want, do you want some more information before you [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3697.96s)]
*  commit that money to Brock Purdy? [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3700.2400000000002s)]
*  I think that would be reasonable, even if it costs you a little bit more in the long run. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3701.8399999999997s)]
*  He should hire Kirk Cousins as his advisor. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3706.72s)]
*  Just to scare them. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3710.7999999999997s)]
*  Seahawks, we mentioned Gino and the 18th pick, they're over the cap. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3712.72s)]
*  So they basically have to figure out the Gino thing. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3715.8799999999997s)]
*  Trading him is not going to really buy them flexibility. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3718.44s)]
*  And then the last one is the Vikings. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3720.64s)]
*  JJ McCarthy, year two. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3722.6s)]
*  Darno will be the 44.2 million franchise tag. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3724.96s)]
*  They have the 24th pick and they have 60 million in cap space. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3728.44s)]
*  And they're a team. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3733.44s)]
*  We mentioned them earlier when we were talking about the Superbowl odds. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3734.4s)]
*  That's a team where the odds could shift pretty dramatically. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3738.44s)]
*  Like 32 to one right now. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3741.0s)]
*  They do a couple moves and a couple things all of a sudden I could see [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3743.8399999999997s)]
*  them getting the, getting the bump. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3747.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm watching them. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3750.6s)]
*  Green Bay is the other one that I think we just kind of have to see how [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3751.4s)]
*  March and April go for these teams. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3754.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3755.96s)]
*  It's like with Darnold, if you look at it on the whole, he probably [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3756.2000000000003s)]
*  performed statistically like the 14th or 16th best starter in the NFL. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3759.28s)]
*  So that's kind of the bar you need JJ McCarthy to clear. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3764.6s)]
*  You don't need him to be like a top five quarterback. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3767.08s)]
*  It's like with that system, with a good offensive coach, with Justin [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3769.2000000000003s)]
*  Jefferson, Jordan Addison, can you upgrade aspects of the offensive line? [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3772.92s)]
*  Your offense really could be better next year than it was this year. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3777.68s)]
*  And then you just put your faith in Brian Flores on the defensive side of the ball. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3781.2000000000003s)]
*  So yeah, that's the whole point of drafting McCarthy is that he's on a rookie [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3784.72s)]
*  deal, you don't have to pay Darnold anymore. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3787.7999999999997s)]
*  You can upgrade other areas of the roster. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3789.9599999999996s)]
*  Well, one thing, one question with them with him is would he be the [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3792.68s)]
*  number one pick in this draft? [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3797.2799999999997s)]
*  If teams knew he was a hundred percent healthy. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3799.12s)]
*  Cause I think people like McCarthy last year, McCarthy is a draft prospect. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3801.48s)]
*  It seems like it's higher than Ken Ward or Sanders this year. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3806.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3809.16s)]
*  And we're talking about how Ken Ward has to be in the top three. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3809.72s)]
*  So my guess would be, you know, see if they almost think of that way for the Vikings. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3812.36s)]
*  Like we, we used this capital last year with this great season. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3816.84s)]
*  Didn't end the way we wanted it, but now we have cap space and this guy who's [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3820.1200000000003s)]
*  coming in, who'd be the number one pick in the draft potentially. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3824.04s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3826.84s)]
*  I think he probably would be. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3827.6000000000004s)]
*  I think everybody, you know, the people I've heard and like, and respect to do [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3828.56s)]
*  this stuff have mostly said that the quarterbacks this year would certainly [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3832.48s)]
*  go below the top four guys from last year. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3836.52s)]
*  So I think you're right. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3839.6000000000004s)]
*  Can I give you one more crazy wildcard trade and then we'll go, just for your [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3841.2000000000003s)]
*  reaction, JJ McCarthy for Herbert. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3844.52s)]
*  The chargers say no. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3853.84s)]
*  Oh, I think they say no. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3857.2400000000002s)]
*  I just wanted to, I wanted to talk it out. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3858.32s)]
*  I love it. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3860.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3861.1200000000003s)]
*  Harbaugh's like, ah, love what I, what I got from my guy last year. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3861.6s)]
*  You know who won me a title? [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3866.4s)]
*  McCarthy. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3868.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3868.72s)]
*  I'd have some cap space. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3869.7999999999997s)]
*  Like I'm really interested in what the charges are doing. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3870.8799999999997s)]
*  Cause it seems like both is out of there and it's, that's not as big of a deal as [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3873.24s)]
*  it probably is on paper because if you've watched him the last couple of years, I [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3877.4399999999996s)]
*  don't think he's been Mr. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3881.7599999999998s)]
*  Reliable, but it's a big foundational piece for them that didn't totally work out. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3882.8399999999997s)]
*  And you think about what happened with them last season where a lot of things [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3887.9199999999996s)]
*  lined up schedule, you know, some of the pieces they had, and now I don't like [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3891.9199999999996s)]
*  their scenario nearly as much this year. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3897.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3899.48s)]
*  They got to figure out the Herbert piece. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3899.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3901.6s)]
*  He's a free agent. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3902.28s)]
*  So yeah, they, they don't have a lot of, they don't have a ton of talent. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3903.1200000000003s)]
*  Like they've got good offensive tackles. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3905.84s)]
*  They've got Herbert, they've got McConkie. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3907.92s)]
*  So that's a nice sort of foundation, I guess, for the offense. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3909.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't know if you trust Greg Roman to make the most out of those pieces. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3913.7200000000003s)]
*  And then defensively, it's kind of has to be all coaching unless they can really [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3917.0s)]
*  add some upgrades here this off season. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3921.04s)]
*  So you're working on it your annual 50 best free agents ever for the season list. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3923.32s)]
*  That's right. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3929.16s)]
*  I got the tab up right here. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3929.64s)]
*  T Higgins has been number one on a lot of lists. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3931.32s)]
*  Who's my number one guy I want the Patriots to get. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3933.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3936.4s)]
*  Is there a scenario where the Bengals keep T Higgins at a huge price and pay [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3937.48s)]
*  chase and pay Burrow and have a competent football team? [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3941.88s)]
*  Cause I don't understand how they would do it. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3945.16s)]
*  You can do it. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3947.36s)]
*  Joe Burrow has talked about, Hey, the Eagles did it. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3948.04s)]
*  We can figure it. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3950.28s)]
*  There are ways you can do it where you pay big money upfront. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3950.92s)]
*  You spread that cash out over the course of the deals. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3953.6s)]
*  Have way more money than the Bengals. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3956.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3958.2400000000002s)]
*  Bengals are cheap. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3958.48s)]
*  I, yeah, you can't do it if you're cheap. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3959.6s)]
*  Yeah, I do love though. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3961.88s)]
*  Burrow is actually acting. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3963.28s)]
*  He's doing an NBA player impersonation. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3964.76s)]
*  Have you noticed that this he's like going out being like, we need to do this. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3967.44s)]
*  We need to pay this. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3971.8s)]
*  Like he is taking control of the team, like putting pressure on ownership and the front [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3972.76s)]
*  office that if you guys don't do this, like it's on you. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3978.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm telling anyone who puts a microphone in front of my face, what I think we [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3981.52s)]
*  should be doing with this organization. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3985.2s)]
*  I think it's been kind of cool. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3986.9199999999996s)]
*  And I don't, I don't know that you see a lot of quarterbacks go out there. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3988.0s)]
*  Usually they're like, you know, that's not my job. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3991.16s)]
*  You know, I just, I like him, but it's a business. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3993.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3996.4399999999996s)]
*  So that's been a pretty fun storyline for me over the last, whatever, two, three [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=3997.04s)]
*  months. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4000.9599999999996s)]
*  Well, I'm sure he's looking at it. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4001.64s)]
*  Like, dude, I want chase and Higgins. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4002.9199999999996s)]
*  Like, like we're going to be awesome if we just have the three of us and we'll [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4005.88s)]
*  figure out the rest, but you still like the Eagles. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4009.6s)]
*  They have a great owner and who's, you know, perfectly willing to spend money, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4012.6s)]
*  spend money upfront. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4018.84s)]
*  That's the game you have to do if you're going to play it that way. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4020.6800000000003s)]
*  And we, the Bengals have been cheap. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4023.08s)]
*  I'm dealing with this right now at the Patriots. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4025.08s)]
*  The Patriots have been cheap for the last 10 years. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4026.96s)]
*  They have some real opportunity now, cap space with the Drake may rookie [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4028.96s)]
*  contract to spend aggressively. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4032.48s)]
*  Are they going to do it? [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4034.48s)]
*  You know, are they going to actually show out the cash? [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4035.92s)]
*  They haven't done it for a decade. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4038.1600000000003s)]
*  We'll see. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4039.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4040.56s)]
*  I'll give you my dream scenario for the past. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4040.7200000000003s)]
*  Then we'll go. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4042.96s)]
*  Okay. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4043.76s)]
*  Trading back from four to six with the Raiders and either getting a future first [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4044.76s)]
*  or the Raiders second and a fourth, something like that. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4049.28s)]
*  And then taking Mason Graham or the left tackle who's ever left the left tackle [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4052.92s)]
*  might be a guard, might be a tight, whatever. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4057.92s)]
*  I'll take, I'll take either of those. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4059.36s)]
*  We just need good players. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4060.6s)]
*  T Higgins signing him. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4062.7200000000003s)]
*  You're lying back or I'm taking them. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4066.28s)]
*  Is that okay? [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4070.76s)]
*  Are you, are you okay with him being a Pat next year? [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4072.32s)]
*  Cause he's coming. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4074.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4075.6s)]
*  I think the Eagles make one move. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4076.2400000000002s)]
*  They're going to try to keep him, but go, I'm listening. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4077.8s)]
*  They could overpay it. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4079.76s)]
*  Like you said, what's the price? [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4080.48s)]
*  I think the floor is probably around 14 million. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4083.32s)]
*  And if a team wants to blow them away with a contract, it's going to be up [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4085.84s)]
*  around 18 million, I would say. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4088.6400000000003s)]
*  Good. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4090.4s)]
*  Come to new England and then, uh, and then I'm best player available after that in [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4090.6800000000003s)]
*  the draft, cause we need players everywhere. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4094.6s)]
*  That would be my dream scenario. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4096.64s)]
*  Get it, get it, get an asset from the Raiders. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4098.4s)]
*  Cause the Raiders feel a little gamey and desperate to me. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4100.68s)]
*  Um, and go all out for Higgins all out. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4104.16s)]
*  And then there's, if Parsons is actually on the table, I think they [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4108.16s)]
*  have to investigate that one. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4112.68s)]
*  And if it was, you know, even with the fourth pick, I don't really like trading [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4114.84s)]
*  top five picks for, you know, guys in their mid twenties who are making big money. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4118.44s)]
*  I don't know if that's an awesome NFL recipe, but for Parsons, I think [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4125.719999999999s)]
*  you have to think about it, right? [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4129.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4130.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, Parsons, it's like that Khalil Mack deal back in the day. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4130.96s)]
*  I mean, I, I, it might be the biggest trade since like the Ricky Williams [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4133.92s)]
*  trade or something, if he were actually to get dealt when you're talking about [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4137.5599999999995s)]
*  a hall of fame player, premium position in his prime, uh, pretty much 31 [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4140.799999999999s)]
*  teams would be interested. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4146.08s)]
*  But Garrett makes me more nervous, older, a little erratic as a guy. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4147.2s)]
*  I think there's been some weird stuff over the years. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4152.64s)]
*  Uh, the team's not, it doesn't seem to ever be that good with him. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4155.24s)]
*  And I, I just, to give up like a top five pick for that and to have [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4158.8s)]
*  to pay him all that money. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4162.32s)]
*  I don't, I like, is that really changing my destiny? [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4163.32s)]
*  I don't see it. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4166.12s)]
*  I think he's like the final piece for a team that can contend, like the [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4167.6s)]
*  bills, the Eagles, the commanders, a team that's like, Hey, we're trying to win. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4170.8s)]
*  Right now the age is the only thing really for me. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4176.36s)]
*  I think he's been durable. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4178.72s)]
*  He's been productive. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4179.76s)]
*  He's been on some bad teams, but, uh, I would say at least like a first and [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4180.88s)]
*  maybe a second that turns into a first, something like that is, is what I think. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4185.16s)]
*  What's Parsons worth if the Dallas calls the Pats and says, we're [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4189.4s)]
*  ready to move on Parsons. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4193.16s)]
*  We need your fourth pick plus blank. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4194.4s)]
*  It starts at two first round picks. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4197.6s)]
*  I think it might get to three first round picks. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4200.08s)]
*  It might get to two first round picks and two second round picks. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4202.5199999999995s)]
*  Like I'm not even having a conversation without two first round picks. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4205.2s)]
*  And again, it's just bad management by the Cowboys. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4208.76s)]
*  I think to even be considering something like that. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4211.599999999999s)]
*  When you, when you lucked into the thing with the Cowboys, sorry, [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4214.16s)]
*  I got to go on one last rant. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4216.92s)]
*  Yeah, they get Dak Prescott in the fourth round. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4218.12s)]
*  They get a number one wide receiver and CD lamb outside the top five. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4220.639999999999s)]
*  They get Micah Parsons, but the best, maybe the best defensive [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4224.2s)]
*  player in football outside the top five. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4226.88s)]
*  Like they've nailed the hardest things to nail and they can't figure out the [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4229.12s)]
*  other stuff and that's why. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4233.4s)]
*  The Cowboys are the Cowboys, but I'm with you, Jerry Jones, still a [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4235.16s)]
*  actor of the year for that performance in land man. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4239.0s)]
*  Did I tell you my story on that? [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4241.84s)]
*  He did win the Emmy. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4243.2s)]
*  No, you did that. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4243.96s)]
*  We were watching my wife actually paused the screen, looked at me to be like, he [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4244.76s)]
*  could have been one of the greatest actors of this generation. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4250.76s)]
*  Amazing stuff. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4256.0s)]
*  Uh, she'll, when's your free agent piece coming out? [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4257.2s)]
*  Uh, now I think it should be out Monday morning next week. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4259.92s)]
*  Top 50 free agents. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4262.16s)]
*  Is Higgins first? [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4263.44s)]
*  You don't spoil it. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4265.4s)]
*  I'm going to do it based on who's going to be the most expensive to least expensive. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4267.08s)]
*  That's my plan this year. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4271.48s)]
*  So you got to take in positional value and maybe a quarterback we just talked [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4273.16s)]
*  about to differentiate the ringers content might be first on my list. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4277.32s)]

*  director, like I was sitting in these chairs and I sat in the director chairs [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4379.64s)]
*  and I'm like, this is what I want to do when I grow up. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4383.56s)]
*  So I started in the mail room at UTA and kind of hustled and. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4385.280000000001s)]
*  Well, you're a man. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4390.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I forgot this. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4391.160000000001s)]
*  You're a mail room guy. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4391.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4392.88s)]
*  I was like very obsessed with starting at the bottom. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4393.64s)]
*  I'm like, what's the lowest level I can start at. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4397.04s)]
*  And so I started. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4401.0s)]
*  Ronnie James is like that. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4401.400000000001s)]
*  I always think of myself as I'm the brawny James of producers. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4403.92s)]
*  It's really, it's how I view myself. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4406.6s)]
*  And I started off in the mayor and I will, that's where I read [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4408.639999999999s)]
*  my first Bill Simmons column. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4411.96s)]
*  UT. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4413.72s)]
*  I think I had a friend of mine at UTA who was in the mail room with me, who [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4414.04s)]
*  kept telling people that he had signed you Ryan Hayden at UTA and we were like, [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4418.0s)]
*  wow, you signed Bill Simmons. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4423.72s)]
*  We were like 23. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4425.08s)]
*  That's true. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4426.04s)]
*  Cause I was a huge paradise hotel fan and you would write about Paris hotel, [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4426.639999999999s)]
*  paradise hotel, the Celtics, obviously in sports. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4430.72s)]
*  And I was obsessed with your columns. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4432.8s)]
*  Um, and I met Mike White when I worked at UTA and that was 20 years ago. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4435.12s)]
*  And so we've been working together ever since. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4440.08s)]
*  And I then we, Mike and I had a company together. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4441.68s)]
*  I then at one point he came to me and he's like, I'm wasting your energy. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4444.72s)]
*  You're way too ambitious for me. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4449.16s)]
*  Just go start your own company. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4451.0s)]
*  You can always work with me, but you're too ambitious for me. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4452.2s)]
*  So I started my own company and yeah. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4454.76s)]
*  So you went from UTA mail room, worked your way up a little bit, but then [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4457.28s)]
*  eventually landed with Mike White and you open a company with him. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4460.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4464.24s)]
*  I was his assistant and this is right around when like funnier diets started [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4464.56s)]
*  and all these digital, you know, web series. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4468.360000000001s)]
*  Great times. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4470.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4470.76s)]
*  Early 2010s. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4471.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4472.120000000001s)]
*  And I started producing digital shorts and I would do, I did a lot of the first [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4472.68s)]
*  funnier dive videos is I did this because I was obsessed with the Hills. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4476.6s)]
*  Mike and I were both obsessed with the Hills. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4479.400000000001s)]
*  Who wasn't? [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4481.040000000001s)]
*  One of the best shows ever made, honestly. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4482.080000000001s)]
*  And we did a spoof of the Hills with James Franco and Mila Kunis. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4484.240000000001s)]
*  And that's the first thing I ever produced was basically I sat in an office and I [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4488.4800000000005s)]
*  transcribed to Audrina, Justin Bobby scenes. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4492.24s)]
*  Wow. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4496.36s)]
*  James Franco played Justin Bobby. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4496.84s)]
*  I remember this actually. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4499.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4501.0s)]
*  That's the first thing I ever produced. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4501.24s)]
*  And I drove around West Hollywood looking for a bar to let us shoot at it. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4502.76s)]
*  And not the Lilas was a bar called Cameron. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4505.92s)]
*  They were, it was a bar on Santa Monica Boulevard and they let me shoot there for [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4510.719999999999s)]
*  free and everyone showed up and, and yeah, that was the first thing I produced. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4513.12s)]
*  And then I was just hustling. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4517.5199999999995s)]
*  I was always really ambitious as an assistant. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4519.28s)]
*  And at one point Mike came to me as his assistant. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4523.04s)]
*  He goes, I just got a show picked up at HBO called enlightened and the pilot. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4525.36s)]
*  And he's like, do you want to produce it? [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4529.36s)]
*  And I was his assistant. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4530.8s)]
*  I was like, yeah. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4531.5599999999995s)]
*  So Laura Dern, Laura Dern, I was like 27, 28, and I would show up to these rooms, [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4533.24s)]
*  Mike Lombardo and soon, Agile and Laura Dern. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4537.32s)]
*  And, and I didn't realize how young I was at the time. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4539.84s)]
*  I just was like, yeah, I deserve to be here for whatever reason. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4542.76s)]
*  And they were probably looking at me like, who's this, who's this kid that's in the [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4546.160000000001s)]
*  room and I produced the show and yeah, I was the one only producer. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4551.120000000001s)]
*  And that, that's how it got going. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4554.8s)]
*  That's how it got going. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4556.4400000000005s)]
*  So what are the tricks before we talk to the history of white lotus, which is [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4557.0s)]
*  fascinating, what are the, what are the tricks you learn with producing a TV show [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4560.280000000001s)]
*  that like the common person wouldn't understand? [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4564.4400000000005s)]
*  Cause people just see producer. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4566.76s)]
*  It's a name that gets thrown around when you live in LA, you're like, what do you [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4568.52s)]
*  do? I'm a producer and people are like, oh, yeah. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4571.56s)]
*  And they don't really know what that means or what you do. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4573.48s)]
*  It's embarrassing how many people say they're like, it really is embarrassing. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4575.679999999999s)]
*  But, you know, I, I played basketball. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4578.5199999999995s)]
*  I got my, my high school basketball coach, Mike Hibbs in DC who, who coached [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4580.48s)]
*  at the MAPHA one of the most famous high school basketball programs in the country. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4584.5199999999995s)]
*  I, and so I was the glue guy. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4589.36s)]
*  I was the guy like taking charge. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4591.12s)]
*  It was a Kurt Rambas of my, of my team. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4592.48s)]
*  And that's how I view producing. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4594.839999999999s)]
*  I really, I'm the glue guy. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4596.799999999999s)]
*  Like, you know, we're having trouble closing the production designer's deal. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4597.92s)]
*  I will step in and close the deal, you know, casting locations, deal with the [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4602.36s)]
*  network, deal with notes, deal with release date, deal with marketing. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4607.28s)]
*  You know, I think the best producers know where there's kind of an issue and they [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4610.44s)]
*  step in and they kind of, you know, take over an issue or prevent issues from [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4614.92s)]
*  coming, but you know, on a day to day level, I can't tell you what my day will [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4618.96s)]
*  be, just things will present themselves. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4622.24s)]
*  And again, I think the best producers can kind of put their ego aside and step [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4624.44s)]
*  in and handle any situation. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4628.759999999999s)]
*  So you're probably glue guy problem solver. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4631.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4634.2s)]
*  So it's like that little more, little more important than Phinney Smith. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4635.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4638.96s)]
*  But yeah, almost like Andrea Goudala mid 2010s, warriors range. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4639.2s)]
*  I would take that. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4643.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4643.679999999999s)]
*  I'm, I'm, I like to think of myself more like an Austin Reeves guy. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4643.88s)]
*  Like if I need to like jury duty, for example, was an idea that kind of, I [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4647.5599999999995s)]
*  originated with another producer, Todd Schulman, and we were kind of figuring [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4653.4s)]
*  out how can we, Todd worked with Sasha and I work with Eric Andre, did Bad Trip. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4657.36s)]
*  And we're like, how can we take what we did and put that in TV? [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4661.639999999999s)]
*  And we came up with this idea of jury duty. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4664.44s)]
*  We hired the writers and kind of originated it and was really creative. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4665.88s)]
*  We really was really the engine creatively. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4670.36s)]
*  And then on something like white Lotus, Mike White is a genius. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4673.0s)]
*  That's Mike White's creative vision. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4676.4s)]
*  And my role in that is really kind of to be there by his side and do [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4678.24s)]
*  whatever Mike needs me to do. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4682.5199999999995s)]
*  So I, I, you know, like to think I can go, I can do both things. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4684.36s)]
*  Like it can originate things creatively, like jury duty or white house [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4688.4400000000005s)]
*  plumbers is something I originated. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4691.36s)]
*  Or if it's something like super store or white Lotus, I can step in with a [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4693.08s)]
*  creator and kind of help them get their vision made and hopefully make it as, [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4696.76s)]
*  you know, as good as it can be. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4700.4800000000005s)]
*  And what's the right number of projects to have going at the same time? [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4701.92s)]
*  Cause this is part of the problems. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4705.36s)]
*  If you start doing well, then you start grabbing and all of a sudden you're [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4706.84s)]
*  doing like 10 things and you're not doing any of them well. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4710.12s)]
*  I've trouble saying no. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4712.24s)]
*  I have trouble with boundaries. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4713.28s)]
*  But I haven't, you know, it's a good question. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4714.4s)]
*  I haven't found the answer to that yet, but you know, the problem with our [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4716.48s)]
*  business is you never know what's going to get made, what's not going to get [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4720.679999999999s)]
*  made and why it gets made. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4724.08s)]
*  And that's kind of part of the white Lotus story. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4725.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4727.28s)]
*  So I'll get into, but so I'm, I'm a, I maybe have too many projects, but you [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4727.679999999999s)]
*  know, again, you just never know what's going to actually come to fruition. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4733.28s)]
*  And, and you know, producers only get paid in success, so you have to have [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4736.44s)]
*  a lot going to make a living. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4741.16s)]
*  The timeline of it is always so fascinating to me when people like get a deal done. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4743.16s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4748.0s)]
*  Just getting the deal done. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4748.32s)]
*  You have to have the meetings. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4749.92s)]
*  You have to talk people into it. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4751.16s)]
*  When you do it, how many months is that? [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4752.52s)]
*  That's like four to six. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4754.0s)]
*  Just close the deal this morning. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4755.24s)]
*  That took eight months. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4756.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4758.56s)]
*  And why it took eight months. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4759.0s)]
*  It could have taken two weeks. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4759.96s)]
*  If people just got on the phone and go hear the issues, that's eight months. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4761.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4765.0s)]
*  So couldn't tell you why eight months. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4765.4800000000005s)]
*  Best case scenario, four months, probably somewhere four to eight [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4767.04s)]
*  months, maybe even like a year. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4770.6s)]
*  Well, I wouldn't against the white lotus story to actually [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4772.0s)]
*  prove it could be a week. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4774.4800000000005s)]
*  It could be a week. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4776.04s)]
*  But that's where the case where HBO loves creators. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4776.96s)]
*  They love Mike. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4779.88s)]
*  He had an idea and they're like, done, go do it. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4781.32s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4783.16s)]
*  If there's a little bit of pressure. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4783.68s)]
*  That's an anomaly. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4784.16s)]
*  Yes. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4785.2s)]
*  It's, it's, it is the, it's, it is an anomaly. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4785.52s)]
*  The, it usually takes four to eight months to get a deal done. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4787.8s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4790.76s)]
*  For whatever reason. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4791.12s)]
*  So you get the deal done. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4791.84s)]
*  So let's say four to eight. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4793.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4795.0s)]
*  Now you got to start writing outlines, scripts that could be like another year. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4795.2s)]
*  Could be another year. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4800.2s)]
*  Then the studio network will sit on it. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4801.72s)]
*  Me, it did like when we turned Mike turned in lights and in on a Friday, [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4804.72s)]
*  that's the first show I produced. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4808.5199999999995s)]
*  They greenlit it on a Monday. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4810.24s)]
*  And I was like, Oh, this business is super easy. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4811.72s)]
*  This is, this is how the rookie wants the Superbowl title the first year and [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4813.44s)]
*  thinks they're going to be back every year. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4817.5199999999995s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4819.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4819.48s)]
*  And I'm like, Oh, this is easy. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4820.08s)]
*  And that is, that is the anomaly. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4821.48s)]
*  It usually can take a month, two months, three months for a studio [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4824.44s)]
*  network to read something, do the internal economics budgeted. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4828.48s)]
*  And then goes on vacation. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4833.639999999999s)]
*  We got, we got to push this to January cause Bob's away. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4836.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4839.879999999999s)]
*  June, July where it's June, July for whatever reasons, when kids are, you [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4840.12s)]
*  know, out of school vacation, it's August, August is Toronto. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4843.5199999999995s)]
*  There's a bunch of stuff in August. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4847.48s)]
*  The meeting gets canceled. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4848.719999999999s)]
*  Oh, I thought we were meeting Wednesday. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4849.959999999999s)]
*  We got to push it. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4851.08s)]
*  When's your next availability? [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4851.959999999999s)]
*  I can't do it. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4853.28s)]
*  And then that's 10 more days. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4853.839999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4854.919999999999s)]
*  September's can, whatever, like there's something, you know, whatever [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4855.16s)]
*  is South by whatever it is. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4857.5599999999995s)]
*  So then it's October. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4858.92s)]
*  So things take so much longer than you think it's going to take. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4860.4s)]
*  It's the most incompetent system I've ever seen the way, the way it's done [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4863.68s)]
*  and how hard it is just to get balls going. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4867.4s)]
*  But then when you actually get going, now you're in the outline process. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4869.72s)]
*  Then they have to approve that. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4874.0s)]
*  Then you're in like, all right, now it's like the giant advanced outline. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4875.84s)]
*  They have to prove that. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4879.64s)]
*  Then it's like the first possible pilot script. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4880.48s)]
*  And that goes, and this could be like another year and a half, right? [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4883.48s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4886.48s)]
*  And then, and then you, at some point you go, wait, what, what are we making? [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4887.16s)]
*  Why are we making this? [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4889.599999999999s)]
*  And you kind of, you hope after a year and a half, you're still excited [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4890.32s)]
*  about the idea you sold and the idea still makes sense and are still relevant. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4893.4s)]
*  We're still viable because that's part of the problem. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4898.24s)]
*  Like culture shifts, things happen, things that were interesting a year [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4901.2s)]
*  and a half ago, aren't interesting anymore. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4905.2s)]
*  White House plumbers was an idea. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4907.04s)]
*  My dad, my dad's a hun, my dad's from Hungary. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4909.2s)]
*  He's an immigrant. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4911.879999999999s)]
*  He, he ended up in DC, a doctor. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4912.4s)]
*  He would call me with this idea for, I'm not exaggerating, five years. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4917.12s)]
*  He called me and I would go to whole foods on Santa Monica and I'd like [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4920.5199999999995s)]
*  fill up my food after work and he just would, he pitched me in this idea. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4923.759999999999s)]
*  I put him on mute. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4926.96s)]
*  I wouldn't listen. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4927.639999999999s)]
*  And finally to get him to shut up. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4928.92s)]
*  I'm like, okay, I'll come to DC. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4930.08s)]
*  I'll meet this guy who has some interesting stories. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4931.5199999999995s)]
*  Everyone has an interesting story, right? [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4933.719999999999s)]
*  So I, I was on my way to Montreal to shoot something else. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4935.639999999999s)]
*  I literally land. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4938.44s)]
*  I left the airport. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4939.96s)]
*  I gave myself like two hours. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4941.0s)]
*  When I met this guy and he tells me the story of the White House plumbers. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4942.599999999999s)]
*  And this is probably 2016. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4946.08s)]
*  And I was, I leave the hospital, the guy was in the hospital and I was like, [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4948.32s)]
*  this is an incredible story. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4951.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4952.5199999999995s)]
*  My dad was right. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4952.96s)]
*  I fly to Montreal. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4953.639999999999s)]
*  I think about it for a year. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4954.639999999999s)]
*  I finally start meeting with writers. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4956.5599999999995s)]
*  So do you think about it? [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4957.92s)]
*  Like, what's it like as a movie? [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4958.839999999999s)]
*  What's it like as a script? [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4960.16s)]
*  That you're trying to figure out the best model for it. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4961.28s)]
*  And it's funny. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4963.599999999999s)]
*  It actually comes back to white lotus season three, which is I'm on a flight. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4964.24s)]
*  I see this movie death of Stalin, which is an incredible movie, Armando Iannucci. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4967.5599999999995s)]
*  And I'm like, oh my God, this is a, because the story of the White House [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4972.0s)]
*  plumbers and Nixon Watergate is, is a comedy. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4974.76s)]
*  It's tragic, you know, comedy. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4977.6s)]
*  And so I'm like, oh, this would be so funny in this tone. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4979.84s)]
*  And then I saw Jason Isaacs and I was like, Jason Isaacs is brilliant. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4983.160000000001s)]
*  And that comes back later in white lotus, but Jerry West, Jason Isaacs. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4986.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4990.8s)]
*  No, didn't he play Jerry West? [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4991.320000000001s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4992.96s)]
*  Who played? [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4993.56s)]
*  Oh, that was Jason, uh, Jason Clark. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4993.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4996.4800000000005s)]
*  But got my Jason screwed up. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4997.400000000001s)]
*  But this is 2016, right? [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=4999.080000000001s)]
*  So then I, white house plumbers, I pitched it to writers. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5000.12s)]
*  We pitched it to Woody Harrelson signs on, pitch it to Justin Theroux signs on. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5003.36s)]
*  We sell it. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5007.5599999999995s)]
*  Do you feel like it's like a party where the, when the first star comes on, then [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5008.64s)]
*  it just becomes like dominoes. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5012.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5014.36s)]
*  Cause you're like, once you get the first person on, it's easier to get the second. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5014.599999999999s)]
*  You're like, oh yeah, Woody's coming to this party. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5017.4s)]
*  Like it's way. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5019.2s)]
*  That's what happened with us with 30 for 30. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5020.0s)]
*  We got Barry Levinson and he vetted the whole, once we had him, it made the, it [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5021.44s)]
*  made the next like five people easy, but we had to get him to get it going. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5026.36s)]
*  I think I'm like, oh, for 70 with my 30 for 30 pitches at some point. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5030.84s)]
*  Just such as I don't control it anymore. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5035.48s)]
*  So, um, so then, so this is 2019 we sell to HBO. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5036.799999999999s)]
*  They're like, we're making this COVID happens. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5040.639999999999s)]
*  It's pushed 21, 2021, 2022. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5042.759999999999s)]
*  And then all of a sudden an idea that has never been made in 40 years, I get a [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5045.84s)]
*  call, Oh, you know, this is Julia Roberts, Sean Penn project called [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5051.84s)]
*  Gaslit that's getting shot the exact same time I'm shooting white house [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5055.2s)]
*  plumbers, which is the exact same story. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5059.4s)]
*  And so this idea I've been thinking about for six years, which has never existed. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5062.08s)]
*  All of a sudden my show comes out two months after the exact same show, which [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5067.76s)]
*  is something I can't control. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5073.2s)]
*  So then at that point, it's like, Oh, we're the second Watergate show about [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5074.24s)]
*  G Gordon and Lady and Howard Hunt. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5078.12s)]
*  And that's just the difficulty of producing. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5080.12s)]
*  It's like, that's something that's so out of my control. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5082.2s)]
*  You put all this energy into something. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5084.719999999999s)]
*  And then by the time my show comes out, it's kind of an afterthought. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5086.0s)]
*  Oh, we've already seen that show. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5088.96s)]
*  Saw it on stars. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5090.879999999999s)]
*  What's your, what's your best thing that you had that fell apart, but it's still [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5091.839999999999s)]
*  haunts you at night the same way, like the 1985 finals haunts me for the [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5096.5599999999995s)]
*  cell phone. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5100.4s)]
*  Yes. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5100.679999999999s)]
*  That's a great question. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5101.2s)]
*  Um, you don't have to say what the project exactly was, but was there one [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5101.799999999999s)]
*  that you're just like the one that got away? [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5106.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5107.839999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5108.2s)]
*  I have several, but that could like kind of slipped through my fingers and you [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5108.679999999999s)]
*  kind of think about those for years. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5111.839999999999s)]
*  And I have probably two of those that I'm like, if I just moved a little quicker [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5114.04s)]
*  or just put a little bit more energy into this or, you know, um, yeah, but I, [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5118.24s)]
*  do they, do they die or do they just go in a coma? [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5124.16s)]
*  What happens is people get busy and if you miss a window with people, then [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5127.4s)]
*  they're off doing other things. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5132.4s)]
*  And I had a show that had three elements that then went off to become massive [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5134.04s)]
*  stars, but I had them before their thing. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5141.28s)]
*  And it was in the world of music, which is a world I love and been trying to [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5144.44s)]
*  figure out the show or movie in. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5147.5199999999995s)]
*  And it just was like about to come together and someone hesitated and I [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5149.36s)]
*  didn't push. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5153.48s)]
*  And then it been all three of those elements have gone off to become big [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5154.08s)]
*  stars and so you can't get the band back together. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5157.5199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5160.32s)]
*  Just too hard. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5161.04s)]
*  It's like having the OKC Thunder in 2010, but when they're on rookie contracts. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5161.92s)]
*  That's it. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5166.639999999999s)]
*  You make up. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5167.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5167.599999999999s)]
*  It's like literally it's exactly it. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5167.92s)]
*  And I just hesitated and made the, I made like, I probably put my energy [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5170.24s)]
*  towards the wrong thing and then it went away. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5173.24s)]
*  Is there a moment when, you know, things are going well because people are now [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5175.92s)]
*  approaching with projects in a way that can you feel that happening in real time? [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5179.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5183.28s)]
*  We have, we have a mutual friends. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5183.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5185.72s)]
*  When you start getting certain invites to things, you're like, things must be [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5186.68s)]
*  going well for getting those invites. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5191.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5193.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5193.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5194.28s)]
*  So, but yeah, I mean, I think like it's a momentum business. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5194.4800000000005s)]
*  I think people love to chase momentum and, and as you kind of start to build [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5197.84s)]
*  momentum becomes slightly easier, but not. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5201.4400000000005s)]
*  It's never totally easy. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5204.64s)]
*  It's never totally easy. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5205.72s)]
*  It's always hard because you always have to have the right idea at the right [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5206.400000000001s)]
*  time, the right configuration of elements. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5209.6s)]
*  And that momentum makes it easier to get your calls returned or get people [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5212.56s)]
*  attached, but you still, it always comes down to the writer. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5216.0s)]
*  It always comes back to that. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5218.84s)]
*  And, and, uh, yeah, but yeah, but yes. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5220.6s)]
*  So the ways it can go wrong. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5223.96s)]
*  Cause we see this when I do the rewatchables research and it's always so [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5225.8s)]
*  interesting with the casting, what ifs or this movie fell through and then they [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5229.160000000001s)]
*  revitalize that years later, the same idea, but it's what totally different [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5233.92s)]
*  people, a different director, the ways it can go wrong, like the, your music [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5237.280000000001s)]
*  scenario where you have the people, you have the right people in your head, but [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5241.52s)]
*  then too much time passes and you lose them and you just can't find the next [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5245.160000000001s)]
*  batch of people, or you have it built around a star, there's a delay in the [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5250.160000000001s)]
*  production, something bad happens. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5254.24s)]
*  You lose the star and now the student doesn't want to make it. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5257.08s)]
*  And then the other one that's the famous one is the person who backed it on the [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5260.32s)]
*  studio side or the Hollywood side. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5263.5199999999995s)]
*  They switched jobs or they got fired. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5265.679999999999s)]
*  And now the new guy, new guy or new lady comes in and it's like, well, that [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5268.599999999999s)]
*  wasn't my project. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5271.84s)]
*  I don't want to do this. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5272.679999999999s)]
*  I'm going through that right now. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5273.5599999999995s)]
*  I had a project that we had like nine bidders on sold it to a studio movie [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5274.5599999999995s)]
*  and now to paramount and now we're going through, like, could you have [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5279.32s)]
*  predicted to know this is my three years ago now that the entire company would be [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5283.28s)]
*  turned over and going through this merger. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5288.08s)]
*  And so, but yeah, I mean, that's really it. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5290.5199999999995s)]
*  Like, or the star of your movie is going through a divorce and you don't, you [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5292.4s)]
*  know, there's so many elements that kind of come in to making things on set and [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5296.44s)]
*  they're not focused and you're in production. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5300.5599999999995s)]
*  You have the perfect script, the perfect director, but the star is distracted. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5303.04s)]
*  So they're not giving them the right, you know, the right performance. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5306.4s)]
*  But I learned my lesson. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5309.08s)]
*  So I did this movie with Sydney Sweeney, Immaculate and, and basically [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5310.28s)]
*  Euphoria was starting, this is 2023 and they're like, Euphoria is starting February [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5315.679999999999s)]
*  19th and you have a moment you're like, okay, we have a six week window with [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5320.32s)]
*  Sydney, the script's not ready. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5325.08s)]
*  Do we try to rush it into production or do we wait till after Euphoria? [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5327.28s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm not waiting because after Euphoria, who knows? [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5331.36s)]
*  And by the way, we, so we rush into production and I'm very proud of the [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5334.32s)]
*  movie, I think the movie turned out great. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5336.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5338.04s)]
*  But then Euphoria doesn't get shot for two more years. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5338.799999999999s)]
*  So it's what I was talking about. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5341.48s)]
*  This was Sydney yesterday. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5342.28s)]
*  I'm like, we were neither finally back into production two years later, but we [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5343.08s)]
*  rushed into this thing and she killed herself. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5347.599999999999s)]
*  She worked six to eight weeks. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5350.0s)]
*  Then she goes to do the movie with Glenn Powell, works six to eight weeks to get [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5352.0s)]
*  it in before Euphoria and then Euphoria doesn't happen for two years. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5354.96s)]
*  And, but I learned my lesson. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5357.44s)]
*  I'm not, I'm never going to just wait. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5359.2s)]
*  You have to like, when it's set, you know, it's a burden in the hand. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5361.32s)]
*  You got to take it. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5364.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5365.6s)]
*  Cause you also see this stuff where, like what happened with Levinson on that [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5365.84s)]
*  show where he starts to do the idol. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5370.64s)]
*  Then the idol becomes this whole thing that ties up. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5373.16s)]
*  And then that entourage, I'm not entourage, you forecast they're on hold. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5376.56s)]
*  They lose the momentum from the series, but that also happens with all [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5381.72s)]
*  these other projects too, where you think, Oh, we're going to start as soon [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5384.4400000000005s)]
*  as they're wrapped up with season four. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5387.76s)]
*  And then it's like, Oh no, they're actually not going to be wrapped up. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5389.36s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5392.28s)]
*  You have a whole set and a whole system in place that now is on hold. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5392.6s)]
*  And then you have to decide whether you want to punt on the actor or not. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5397.120000000001s)]
*  Right? [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5399.360000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5399.64s)]
*  They have, do you replace them or, you know, and I think it's like, it's, [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5400.0s)]
*  it's an imperfect science Hollywood. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5403.0s)]
*  Like, and you, you know, on the rewatchables, you're watching these movies [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5405.120000000001s)]
*  and it's funny people are like, how do they make it so obviously bad or how [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5408.280000000001s)]
*  do they make such a bad movie? [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5411.68s)]
*  And I think, you know, having made things that aren't as good as they [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5413.8s)]
*  probably should be. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5417.28s)]
*  I think you're there's, there's a great quote from a brought from project [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5418.639999999999s)]
*  runway, and I always think about it. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5423.719999999999s)]
*  It's from like the, from the first couple of seasons where Tim gun is [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5425.639999999999s)]
*  like when you're in the monkey house for too long, you stop smelling the shit. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5429.44s)]
*  And like, sometimes you're just like, you're just like getting in it and [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5433.8s)]
*  you're thinking about it all the time and you're like, you're in it. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5436.84s)]
*  And it was like, you're so deep inside of it. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5438.639999999999s)]
*  You're not seeing what feels obvious from the outside. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5441.32s)]
*  And so you can watch a movie 10 years later and go, why didn't [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5444.48s)]
*  they realize the third act didn't work or this was such bad casting, but [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5446.72s)]
*  sometimes you're so deep inside of it. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5451.320000000001s)]
*  You stop seeing the shit. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5453.320000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5455.0s)]
*  And that's why it's a, it's a tough business. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5455.84s)]
*  One of the things that I'm always obsessed about, especially we've talked [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5457.68s)]
*  about on the podcast a bunch is why there's so many cooks in the kitchen [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5461.56s)]
*  with these projects when, especially when you're talking TV and the entire [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5464.92s)]
*  history of TV and what's worked and what's not worked, it's usually like one [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5470.320000000001s)]
*  vision. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5474.92s)]
*  It's like a couple executives trusting the person who had the vision and [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5476.04s)]
*  everybody kind of clearing out and letting them do their thing. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5480.36s)]
*  And that's been most of the great shows we've ever had. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5482.96s)]
*  And I don't understand why Hollywood just doesn't obey this. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5485.56s)]
*  Cause I mean, Mike, Mike, why don't I talk about all time? [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5489.52s)]
*  There's, there's three producers on white Lotus. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5491.68s)]
*  There's Mike, there's me and there's Mark K. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5493.76s)]
*  Mine. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5495.16s)]
*  There's our line producer. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5495.4400000000005s)]
*  And what happens is, you know, the star of the show has a manager. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5496.92s)]
*  So that manager is a producer. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5500.56s)]
*  The star is a producer. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5502.36s)]
*  It's based on a piece of IP that IP has a producer attached. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5503.759999999999s)]
*  The writer of that piece of IP is attached. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5507.44s)]
*  They bring it to a non-writing producer who has a deal at X network or studio. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5509.799999999999s)]
*  There's two people that work at that company. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5513.96s)]
*  So all of a sudden you're on notes calls with seven people, right? [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5516.04s)]
*  And like, when the zoom is so big, you can't fit everyone on your phone. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5519.24s)]
*  Something has probably gone wrong. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5522.839999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5524.04s)]
*  And that's probably not going to turn out well. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5524.44s)]
*  Then you have seven people who have seven ideas, who have seven [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5526.16s)]
*  interpretations of what good is. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5529.12s)]
*  And all of a sudden you have a writer who's trying to service seven different people. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5532.36s)]
*  It's never, it's never going to end up well in all the things I've done that have [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5536.28s)]
*  been successful all have one clear vision and you're all in service of that clear [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5539.84s)]
*  vision. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5544.72s)]
*  I think when there's too many egos and too many people weighing in, it just weighs [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5545.48s)]
*  everything down. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5548.64s)]
*  We see that on the documentary side too, with a lot of the stuff I've been involved [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5549.5599999999995s)]
*  with the, the more people weighing in. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5553.28s)]
*  And one of the things I try to do as a producer of those, and it doesn't always [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5556.959999999999s)]
*  work is you try to funnel the notes through one person. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5561.12s)]
*  So at least they only hear from one voice. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5564.12s)]
*  But like when the Celtics thing I just did, which I'm really proud of, I think it [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5566.639999999999s)]
*  turned out great, but there, you know, we had the Celtics, it's their IP, they have [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5570.2s)]
*  notes, you have the NBA, they're going to weigh in with their notes. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5574.36s)]
*  And then we had our production side and it's like, if they, if you can pass a [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5577.599999999999s)]
*  tipping point, especially if somebody is just in the abyss with whatever they're [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5582.48s)]
*  working on and they're just hearing all these different things and notes are [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5587.48s)]
*  conflicting, it can really fuck them up. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5590.839999999999s)]
*  They every, it seems like every show runner director or whatever, you're going [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5593.4s)]
*  to hit this dark place with what you're working on and you need at least one [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5596.48s)]
*  person to be like, Oh, I got you. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5600.0s)]
*  I got you. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5602.08s)]
*  And that's, that's kind of my role with, with Mike on my list, but also that's a [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5602.759999999999s)]
*  role that I try to, it's a role I try to service in every production I do, which [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5606.4s)]
*  is trying to, trying to kind of push on bad notes and trying to help creators, [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5610.56s)]
*  writers, directors, filter opinions. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5615.280000000001s)]
*  What do I think in my own taste? [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5618.72s)]
*  What do I think is a good idea? [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5620.360000000001s)]
*  What do I think is a bad idea? [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5621.84s)]
*  And I think that's really. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5623.320000000001s)]
*  And picking your battles, right? [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5624.6s)]
*  Like maybe give them this one because it's not worth fighting about. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5625.96s)]
*  Cause I really need to win this one later. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5629.84s)]
*  A thousand percent. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5631.72s)]
*  And like, what is a, what is a, you know, marginal move? [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5632.320000000001s)]
*  What is like, what are, cause it's all tastes, right? [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5634.92s)]
*  Like producing is all tastes, all comes down to like opinion. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5637.92s)]
*  And what, what is a, what's a lateral move that you can give to a network or [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5641.88s)]
*  studio or whomever to then buy back later on. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5645.76s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5648.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh, we have a great, oh my, we have a great story from, from enlightened where [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5649.04s)]
*  the, the network was giving, it was hammering us on this one episode. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5655.56s)]
*  And there was a piece of dialogue that Mike just loved. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5659.32s)]
*  It was so lateral, like whether it was in or not, didn't really matter [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5663.56s)]
*  for some reason, HBO was hammering us and we sent them back a cut with a taken [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5667.64s)]
*  out to get, to make them feel good about it. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5672.08s)]
*  But then we were like, we're going to deliver the line in. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5674.96s)]
*  So we pretended that we had taken it out. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5678.4800000000005s)]
*  We deliver it with the line in. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5680.320000000001s)]
*  And then they didn't notice, of course, cause they, they're probably [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5683.68s)]
*  doing eight different things. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5686.4400000000005s)]
*  They're giving notes. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5688.04s)]
*  And then we go to the premiere and the, and the network, it feels like, you [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5689.280000000001s)]
*  know, we should premiere that episode. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5691.76s)]
*  And it was the episode that we had switched out the dialogue. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5693.6s)]
*  So we're like, holy shit, they're going to notice in the premiere. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5696.4400000000005s)]
*  And so we, we play the, and Mike and I are sitting next to all the [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5699.8s)]
*  HBO executives had given us those notes and they never noticed. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5703.64s)]
*  They didn't remember. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5707.280000000001s)]
*  And then we sent them all t-shirts after the premiere with the line of dialogue. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5708.52s)]
*  And then by the way, they were like, what does that mean? [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5714.04s)]
*  They had no, they have no memory of it, but it's a, that's a good example. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5715.56s)]
*  It's like, we're getting these notes from people and they're like, it's a [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5718.320000000001s)]
*  Monday morning for them Tuesday morning. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5721.72s)]
*  They probably forgot what they said. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5723.12s)]
*  And ultimately you got to trust your creative instincts. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5724.88s)]
*  And, and by that episode, one of our best episodes we ever did in that line [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5726.68s)]
*  that we took out, I swear is so often quoted from enlightened. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5730.2s)]
*  Wow. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5734.16s)]
*  Well, you know, part of the problem is people feel like sometimes [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5735.12s)]
*  they just have to give notes. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5738.04s)]
*  Always. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5739.32s)]
*  It's, or else it doesn't look like they gave a shit or did, or watched [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5739.8s)]
*  it or did their job or cared. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5743.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5745.68s)]
*  So here's six extra notes, just cause I want to make sure my email is long enough. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5746.64s)]
*  Or you have like 19 people on the zoom, right? [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5751.36s)]
*  And every person is like, if I don't say something, I feel like I'm a loser. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5753.24s)]
*  So then everyone has to weigh in with something that is like, yeah, just the [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5756.639999999999s)]
*  way in and I've been in those positions where you're on these zooms and you [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5761.5599999999995s)]
*  don't really have any thing to add, but you feel like you have to. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5763.76s)]
*  Otherwise you look like a total loser. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5767.0s)]
*  So, right. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5768.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5769.28s)]
*  So it's a, it's a weird process. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5769.48s)]
*  One of the best, the best behind the scenes experience I had was when we did [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5772.12s)]
*  the Andre, the giant doc is they just trusted us and it was, you know, Jason [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5776.04s)]
*  was the director who's great. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5780.88s)]
*  I don't know if you met him, but we just kind of figured out the framework and it [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5781.92s)]
*  just kind of went smoothly and it was one of those things where afterwards I was [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5786.24s)]
*  like, man, I wish, which that's just how it went. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5790.36s)]
*  There's just like a couple of people figuring it out. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5794.04s)]
*  Everyone else trusts those people. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5795.92s)]
*  And there you go. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5798.04s)]
*  And we'll talk about how unique white Lotus is, but we we'll take a quick break [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5798.68s)]
*  and then we'll talk about, uh, this is a unicorn type of show anyway. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5802.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5807.12s)]
*  So white Lotus, which you were involved with intimately from the very [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5807.400000000001s)]
*  beginning, the perfect kind of TV show from a production standpoint in a lot [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5810.56s)]
*  of ways, you're not relying on a star because you can change the cast. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5816.240000000001s)]
*  Whatever you want. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5819.68s)]
*  You have one person writing the entire show almost as like an eight hour movie. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5821.04s)]
*  You have a network that completely trusts that person and you kind of have a blank [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5825.4400000000005s)]
*  canvas to be like, all right, we have this hotel here's, here's the premise. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5830.56s)]
*  We're going to dive into this. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5836.120000000001s)]
*  We can change locations every year. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5837.280000000001s)]
*  It's a show that I'm sure you probably thought was going to be a one year show. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5839.639999999999s)]
*  And now you can potentially do eight or nine seasons of it and you guys are [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5842.84s)]
*  controlling it and they trust you. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5846.84s)]
*  This is like impossible. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5848.44s)]
*  It never works out this way. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5849.68s)]
*  So why does it ever work out this way? [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5850.8s)]
*  I mean, cause I mean, the reality is white Lotus happened because of confluence of [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5853.28s)]
*  events that could never be replicated. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5857.639999999999s)]
*  And I give HBO immense credit for trusting Mike. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5860.12s)]
*  And I mean, it's funny. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5865.28s)]
*  It's like, it's kind of feels like a, when those bands and you're like, Oh, [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5866.8s)]
*  you're a one hit wonder, like over overnight success and you've been grinding [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5869.88s)]
*  for 15 years to make it. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5873.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5874.92s)]
*  And so Mike first pitched me a version of white Lotus, probably 2008. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5875.64s)]
*  We were in Spain together. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5879.24s)]
*  2008. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5880.4400000000005s)]
*  We were walking in Tarifa, Spain. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5881.68s)]
*  I'll never forget it. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5884.12s)]
*  And he pitches me. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5885.2s)]
*  We're like just walking and we were there. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5885.92s)]
*  Paramount, I don't know, Paramount was paying Mike to write school of rock too. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5889.16s)]
*  And Mike was like, I don't want to, and I was working as Mike's assistant. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5894.56s)]
*  He's like, I don't want to be in LA. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5897.68s)]
*  Like, why don't we just go to Spain? [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5899.4800000000005s)]
*  I'll write it. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5900.72s)]
*  You can like do whatever you want and I'll just sit and write and you can like live [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5901.56s)]
*  in Spain. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5905.52s)]
*  I'm like, I'm single. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5905.92s)]
*  I'm in my twenties. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5907.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5908.12s)]
*  Sounds amazing. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5908.36s)]
*  So we went off to Spain. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5909.24s)]
*  We were just walking one day and he pitches him this idea about a hotel show, [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5910.76s)]
*  upstairs, downstairs hotel show. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5914.68s)]
*  And the central relationship is a couple that's on a honeymoon. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5916.4800000000005s)]
*  And one is rich, one is marrying into money. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5921.64s)]
*  And the show kind of starts with the groom returning and the bride is not there and [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5925.16s)]
*  you don't know what's happened. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5930.04s)]
*  And I'm like, that's incredible. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5931.6s)]
*  Wow. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5933.36s)]
*  Cause that, cause so that's 2008. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5933.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5936.08s)]
*  Cause the whole premise of we're starting this show, but something weird happened. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5936.76s)]
*  You're going to eventually discover what happened. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5940.8s)]
*  That's like a very late 2010s premise. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5942.4s)]
*  And so we go in and then it's also an anthology series. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5945.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5947.76s)]
*  So we go into HBO, we pitched idea and the feedback was anthology series are not a [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5948.24s)]
*  thing. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5953.68s)]
*  It'll never be a thing. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5954.16s)]
*  Not interested. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5955.2s)]
*  So why would they say that? [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5956.6s)]
*  Cause at that point it really hadn't been a thing. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5959.16s)]
*  Cause it's like, they're talking about like the, I'm trying to think some of [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5960.72s)]
*  the stuff they did, I guess, the hitchhiker. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5964.16s)]
*  This is before True Detective. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5967.2s)]
*  So this is True Detective was really the thing that I think broke open anthology [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5968.08s)]
*  series. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5971.5199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5971.84s)]
*  So it's 2013 range. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5972.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5973.76s)]
*  And I, and I get from their perspective, it's like, you're going to start a show, [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5974.0s)]
*  the hardest thing is a pilot, right? [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5977.56s)]
*  Like getting people engaged and interested in characters. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5978.84s)]
*  And then to replicate that every season, it's really hard to get people re-engage. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5982.080000000001s)]
*  It's, it's almost impossible. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5986.0s)]
*  But the funny thing is the model you laid out earlier, where you then don't have to [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5987.04s)]
*  rely on a fancy famous cast member. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5990.56s)]
*  It's actually like a better model. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5993.76s)]
*  It's incredible. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5994.92s)]
*  Well, well, the star of white Lotus is Mike White. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5995.280000000001s)]
*  That's the star. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5996.92s)]
*  And so, so HBO passes and it's an idea that's just kind of sitting out there. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=5998.240000000001s)]
*  One of the executives at HBO who heard it then goes to Amazon and kind of goes, [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6002.0s)]
*  Oh, what was that a honeymoon idea? [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6006.84s)]
*  You know, blah, blah, blah. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6009.200000000001s)]
*  Why don't we try and do that here? [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6010.0s)]
*  So Mike goes, great. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6010.96s)]
*  We go, we talked to them about this honeymoon show. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6012.52s)]
*  And at that point it was a show about this couple that's traveling from. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6014.84s)]
*  And I think Mike was kind of inspired. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6018.16s)]
*  He'd gone on a trip and Phil Jackson was actually, it was actually Phil Jackson [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6019.4400000000005s)]
*  who inspired it. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6022.8s)]
*  The Zen master? [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6023.4400000000005s)]
*  Yes. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6024.240000000001s)]
*  Mike and Mike is not, Mike is not a sports guy. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6025.08s)]
*  He was, I can't remember which country he was in, but he went from like, you [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6027.4400000000005s)]
*  know, this great hotel to that great hotel to another great hotel within the same [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6030.52s)]
*  country and Phil Jackson was on the same. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6033.88s)]
*  He was like, Oh, we must have the same, you know, travel agent who had booked us [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6036.2s)]
*  into the same exact hotels. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6040.04s)]
*  So Mike kept seeing him at every hotel. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6042.12s)]
*  So he was like, okay, this honeymoon couple basically is going to travel to [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6044.84s)]
*  different hotels and he's going to, they're going to see the same couples or [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6047.72s)]
*  same people to the same travel agent. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6052.16s)]
*  So we go and Mike is in Sri Lanka. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6054.52s)]
*  He's working on this honeymoon show when everyone at Amazon gets fired. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6056.44s)]
*  And then they replace Roy Price. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6061.8s)]
*  It was running Amazon at the time with another executive and that executive [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6064.52s)]
*  just didn't get the show. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6068.4400000000005s)]
*  The show dies. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6069.92s)]
*  So you're calling it the honeymoon show and the new guys like the honeymoon. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6070.76s)]
*  What the fuck is this? [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6074.200000000001s)]
*  He's out. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6075.040000000001s)]
*  Gone. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6075.84s)]
*  So that was our second strike, right? [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6076.360000000001s)]
*  So that's 2015, 2016. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6078.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6081.280000000001s)]
*  2019 comes. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6082.360000000001s)]
*  We had met Jennifer Coolidge in 2006 doing a movie called gentlemen Broncos. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6083.8s)]
*  Great movie, underappreciated Fox search like maybe with Jared Hess and Mike and [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6087.76s)]
*  I, I'll never forget it. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6092.28s)]
*  We go in, we didn't know Jennifer at the time. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6093.0s)]
*  We go in to have dinner and we see Jennifer at the same restaurant and she's [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6095.28s)]
*  literally sitting at this restaurant and she has her menu this close to her face. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6098.639999999999s)]
*  She's staring at the menu and we're looking at her across the restaurant. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6103.36s)]
*  We're like, who is this person? [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6106.96s)]
*  And she has, Jennifer has terrible eyesight. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6109.0s)]
*  The only way she could read the menu was I'm not joking. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6110.96s)]
*  Literally it's this close to her face. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6113.48s)]
*  And she's just shamelessly reading the menu like this. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6115.88s)]
*  And we just kind of fell in love with her and we became great friends, the [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6119.0s)]
*  three of us and Mike was always inspired about writing a show for her. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6122.0s)]
*  So 2019 comes and she, Mike has this idea for a show called St. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6126.48s)]
*  Patsy and he writes four episodes of the show. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6130.16s)]
*  And we go out in 2019, we pitched the show called St. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6133.76s)]
*  Patsy, which was about Jennifer Coolidge playing a version of Tanya McQuad, [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6136.36s)]
*  version of like a celebrity actress who's going to an accept an award in [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6142.32s)]
*  Sri Lanka and there's a murder mystery. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6146.2s)]
*  Everyone passes. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6149.44s)]
*  Everyone passes. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6150.92s)]
*  And we're basically told, you know, Jennifer's not a TV star or whatever it is. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6151.8s)]
*  So now we have the honeymoon show. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6156.4800000000005s)]
*  Mike was thinking about, we have the couple murder mystery show. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6159.6s)]
*  We have Jennifer in Sri Lanka. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6163.04s)]
*  So those three elements we have kind of simmering. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6164.52s)]
*  And Mike is being pigeonholed now as like incredibly creative guy, but [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6167.120000000001s)]
*  can't have like a giant show. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6171.160000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6172.64s)]
*  He's not, he's not like a big taste guy. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6172.96s)]
*  He's like a, like a small critics love him type of guy. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6174.4400000000005s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6177.160000000001s)]
*  And Platsy is an underdog really. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6178.04s)]
*  Like, and he was, everyone looked at him. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6179.8s)]
*  Oh, he's brilliant, but not commercial. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6181.28s)]
*  And Mike and I had been working together for this point for 15 years. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6184.0s)]
*  We'd made a lot of amazing stuff together, but nothing had really broken through yet. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6186.28s)]
*  2020 comes, Mike writes this great script that was set in Sweden. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6191.56s)]
*  That was a road trip comedy with him and Aubrey Plaza that Mike [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6196.72s)]
*  was going to star in with Aubrey. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6201.16s)]
*  Wow. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6202.56s)]
*  And we get the financing. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6203.2s)]
*  COVID happens. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6205.320000000001s)]
*  Financing falls apart. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6207.16s)]
*  It's July of 2020. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6208.92s)]
*  Mike is like despondent. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6210.599999999999s)]
*  He goes on a road trip by himself. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6211.92s)]
*  I go on a road trip to Colorado and HBO calls out of the blue. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6213.92s)]
*  It's July of 2020 and they go, um, we don't have any programming. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6219.599999999999s)]
*  Is there anything that is COVID? [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6224.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6226.28s)]
*  COVID by the way. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6226.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6227.2s)]
*  Is there anything you can do in a COVID bubble that you can do quickly, [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6227.48s)]
*  cheaply that can be on the air in 2021? [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6230.639999999999s)]
*  It was over email and Mike goes, yeah, I got it. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6234.04s)]
*  And they go, great. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6236.84s)]
*  It's greenlit. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6237.44s)]
*  Like that, just like that. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6238.639999999999s)]
*  And Mike literally didn't know what it was, but he had been thinking about [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6239.92s)]
*  these three different shows over the last 15 years and that he combined all [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6244.28s)]
*  those elements and that became white lotus. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6248.88s)]
*  And we basically had one. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6251.4s)]
*  So it's honeymoon show, Jennifer Coolidge. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6253.28s)]
*  And it's a honeymoon show. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6255.8s)]
*  It's a show that was in Sri Lanka. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6256.8s)]
*  That was some location. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6257.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6259.08s)]
*  And I'll never forget. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6260.08s)]
*  It was like, it was probably August of 2020. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6261.24s)]
*  We get on a phone call with HBO and they're like, you have 30 days to [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6264.0s)]
*  make this good luck. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6268.0s)]
*  And Mike's like, I'm not going to, I'm not going to, and this point also, [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6269.88s)]
*  we had two weeks to find a location. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6273.04s)]
*  What people don't know is originally we were going to do it in Australia. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6275.0s)]
*  And basically we found a hotel in Australia, but we couldn't get our COVID [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6277.64s)]
*  vaccines, vaccinations, visas in time. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6282.68s)]
*  So we basically were like, we pivoted to Hawaii because it was the one place [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6285.48s)]
*  that we could get in and God bless Four Seasons Maui, it's the only hotel in [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6288.32s)]
*  the world that said, yeah, come shoot this during COVID. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6292.68s)]
*  And so- [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6296.08s)]
*  Good career move by the Four Seasons Maui. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6296.56s)]
*  Great career move. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6298.68s)]
*  And Mike was like, I'm not going to Hawaii. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6299.92s)]
*  I'm shooting this in 30 days. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6303.200000000001s)]
*  There's no way I'm doing a season in 30 days. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6304.240000000001s)]
*  And I said to him, I go, this is what we're going to do. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6305.76s)]
*  I never said this and HBO doesn't notice. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6308.4400000000005s)]
*  I go, we're going to show up in Hawaii. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6309.8s)]
*  We're going to get them pregnant. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6312.360000000001s)]
*  As they say in Hollywood, we're going to like get them invested. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6313.4800000000005s)]
*  They're going to spend enough money that we're going to go, actually, we need [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6315.92s)]
*  another 15 million to make the show. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6318.400000000001s)]
*  And he said to me, he goes, if you're wrong about this, I'll kill you. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6320.280000000001s)]
*  This is what he said to me. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6323.400000000001s)]
*  I will kill you. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6324.4400000000005s)]
*  That's going to be season two. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6325.4400000000005s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6326.56s)]
*  And so we went to Hawaii. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6327.52s)]
*  Mike had one script and he didn't even know what the ending was. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6328.72s)]
*  Mike wrote the scripts without knowing where it was going. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6331.4800000000005s)]
*  Cause we had to, we got there in September of 2020. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6334.120000000001s)]
*  We had to shoot by the end of October. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6337.320000000001s)]
*  We had basically six weeks for Mike to write the season, cast the season, hire [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6339.280000000001s)]
*  a crew, scout it and shoot it. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6343.64s)]
*  Cause we had to be done by Christmas to get it on the air, 2021. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6346.0s)]
*  And we arrived and Mike just started writing. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6348.84s)]
*  We were in a 14 day quarantine and Mike wrote almost the entire season in those [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6351.4400000000005s)]
*  14 days. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6355.6s)]
*  So he's like Bradley Cooper and Limitless just cranking it out. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6356.76s)]
*  Yeah, basically. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6359.6s)]
*  And he just kind of poured out of him, but it was really, he had been thinking [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6360.52s)]
*  about the show for 15 years. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6364.120000000001s)]
*  It had been really those elements of things he'd thought about. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6365.280000000001s)]
*  And I remember, I remember we got to a point where like we had 30 days to shoot [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6368.160000000001s)]
*  it, we needed 48 days and I had to call HBO and go, Hey, we're 18 days over [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6372.160000000001s)]
*  budget. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6377.240000000001s)]
*  It's a lot of money. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6378.240000000001s)]
*  And to their credit, they go, we'll give it to you. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6379.200000000001s)]
*  Let's go and do it. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6381.88s)]
*  Well, at that point they probably had like two things going because nobody [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6382.64s)]
*  could film anything. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6386.160000000001s)]
*  And as I told you, like strategically, we had spent enough money where I knew [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6387.080000000001s)]
*  it was like a sunk cost or like, okay, we got to give them this money to get [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6392.64s)]
*  something out of it. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6395.8s)]
*  And, you know, I think we, that was the hardest production I've ever been [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6396.8s)]
*  through because in Hawaii, at that point, if you got COVID, you go into a hotel [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6403.320000000001s)]
*  room 14 days. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6408.4800000000005s)]
*  So during that production, we had so many people get COVID and that was also a [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6409.24s)]
*  point where if you were close to that person, you go get COVID. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6413.12s)]
*  So we had actors getting COVID that would go away for 14 days and we would [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6415.719999999999s)]
*  have to rejuggle the schedule. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6419.32s)]
*  We would have to shoot seven days and like, we had to do everything humanly [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6420.5199999999995s)]
*  possible. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6423.639999999999s)]
*  And another thing people don't know is we actually never finished. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6424.12s)]
*  We were, it was two days before we wrapped and I was like, okay, we're going [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6426.84s)]
*  to make it through. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6430.5199999999995s)]
*  I get a phone call from HBO that someone has tested positive for COVID. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6431.24s)]
*  And it was Jennifer Coolidge's assistant who was basically in the room with her [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6435.679999999999s)]
*  every single day. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6438.96s)]
*  And we were out shooting that famous boat scene where Jennifer's dumping the [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6440.24s)]
*  ashes, she's lying. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6443.8s)]
*  And I had to call the boat. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6445.84s)]
*  I was on the boat. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6447.8s)]
*  I had to call them the AD and go, Jennifer basically, it's like a close contact. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6448.52s)]
*  You need to come back and Jennifer's going to go into a hotel room 14 days. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6455.08s)]
*  We're going to have to shut down right before Christmas. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6459.8s)]
*  And they turned the boats around and I'll never forget Jennifer's face coming off [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6462.24s)]
*  the boat. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6465.28s)]
*  It was heartbreaking because she knew she was going to have to miss Christmas and [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6466.36s)]
*  New Year's and basically be stuck in a hotel room. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6468.68s)]
*  And we shut down and never finished. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6470.72s)]
*  And we basically, which was a gift because then Mike goes and edits the show. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6472.72s)]
*  And we eventually found like a five day window in February the next year to [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6476.92s)]
*  bring everyone back. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6481.240000000001s)]
*  And at that point too, we knew what we were kind of missing. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6482.8s)]
*  We did some reshoots and it was like a gift. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6485.16s)]
*  Honestly, like at that point, it was like the worst thing that could happen. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6487.92s)]
*  It ended up being a gift. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6491.4800000000005s)]
*  We got everyone back somehow and the rest is history. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6492.6s)]
*  You skipped over the casting piece of this when you're doing the thing that fast. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6495.5199999999995s)]
*  So obviously the show has really good casting, but who does that come from? [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6499.04s)]
*  Is it a team thing or did you hire an awesome casting person or is it just [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6504.679999999999s)]
*  people you and Mike like? [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6507.879999999999s)]
*  Well, Meredith Tucker, who's our casting director, Mike and Meredith went to [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6509.4s)]
*  Wesleyan together. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6512.32s)]
*  So they're old friends. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6513.12s)]
*  She's worked, she's amazing. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6514.4s)]
*  And we have a great, we worked, we've all worked together for now for a long time, [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6515.799999999999s)]
*  but it was so quick that we had to cast people we know. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6519.32s)]
*  And, you know, for me, like Sydney Sweeney, I met her in 2019 and I had only [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6522.2s)]
*  seen her in your Florian. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6527.4s)]
*  It's a really specific character. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6528.16s)]
*  And she comes in and she actually pitches me a TV show that I passed on, which I [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6530.12s)]
*  regret and I met her in this meeting and I was like, holy shit, she's so different [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6533.32s)]
*  from a character. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6539.0s)]
*  You meet her in person and I think people don't understand how good of an [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6539.5599999999995s)]
*  actress she is because if you meet her in person, you go, every character she's [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6542.84s)]
*  playing is so different from who she is. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6546.12s)]
*  And so we were casting a part and it, it was against type, right? [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6548.599999999999s)]
*  Cause at that point she'd only played this character in your, for you, who was [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6551.48s)]
*  very dramatic, not funny. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6554.48s)]
*  I meet her in this meeting. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6557.32s)]
*  She's so bubbly. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6558.08s)]
*  She's so personable. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6558.959999999999s)]
*  She's so funny in person. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6559.879999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, she would be so smart in that role because it's unexpected. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6561.879999999999s)]
*  And so that's kind of how that happened. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6567.44s)]
*  Connie Britton was someone that we were friends with. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6569.28s)]
*  Um, and Mike knew for a long time, Mike had worked with her before. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6571.48s)]
*  We knew she'd be perfect. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6574.719999999999s)]
*  Steve Zahn was Mike's brilliant idea that he kind of pulled that out of nowhere. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6576.04s)]
*  We were, we were having trouble casting a part and he's like, what about Steve's [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6579.68s)]
*  on brilliant Murray Bartlett we weren't familiar with. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6582.76s)]
*  And that's Mike's brilliance. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6586.16s)]
*  Like he, Murray Bartlett auditioned and out of a hundred people, he kind of [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6587.360000000001s)]
*  identified Murray, knew it'd be great. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6591.96s)]
*  And Alex Adario came in the first second we saw her audition. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6594.12s)]
*  She like just nailed it. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6597.04s)]
*  She was amazing. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6598.72s)]
*  Jake Lacey, same thing audition. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6599.360000000001s)]
*  We had to do these things really fast. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6600.96s)]
*  Natasha Rothwell, it's like actually a great example of I'm really close [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6603.12s)]
*  with Natasha's agent and I wasn't familiar with Natasha. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6606.6s)]
*  Shauna, her agent called me and was like, just hammering me, hammering me, send me [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6612.120000000001s)]
*  some stuff on Natasha. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6616.280000000001s)]
*  I was like, oh, she's, she's brilliant. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6617.200000000001s)]
*  She won audition and we're just like, fuck it. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6619.120000000001s)]
*  Let's just go. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6621.280000000001s)]
*  Like that was like, just like we had to pull the trigger. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6621.76s)]
*  She ended up being brilliant. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6624.64s)]
*  And so it was really like a combination of people we knew in just quick decisions. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6625.6s)]
*  And you're thinking this is a one and done. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6630.360000000001s)]
*  We're adding here. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6632.8s)]
*  How did we, how do we pull this off? [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6634.160000000001s)]
*  This is finished. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6636.12s)]
*  Not only that, but like we really, the budgets of White Lotus season one were, [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6636.84s)]
*  were, are minuscule compared to some other other dramas. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6640.76s)]
*  We were also like, this could just never air. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6643.6s)]
*  It was like such like, you know, at that point there were like, it was like a COVID [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6645.5199999999995s)]
*  experiment that gives a bunch of money to go shoot a show in a bubble. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6648.48s)]
*  By the way, there was some awful COVID experiments. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6652.08s)]
*  This was by far the most successful one, I think. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6654.92s)]
*  But it really was this, this show never happens if not for COVID, honestly, in [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6657.16s)]
*  the COVID bubble. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6660.56s)]
*  Oh, thank you, COVID. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6661.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6662.44s)]
*  By the way. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6662.76s)]
*  Thank you, COVID. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6663.08s)]
*  But, um, yeah, I think that, uh, if you had told me then, and Mike and I were [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6663.88s)]
*  talking about this other day, if you had told me five years later, I would be in [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6669.400000000001s)]
*  Bangkok, like at a Marvel size premiere. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6672.76s)]
*  And they're like, we're walking out in front of 5,000 people yelling our names. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6675.8s)]
*  I would tell you that's impossible. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6680.08s)]
*  So you finished the show. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6682.0s)]
*  HBO loves it. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6684.200000000001s)]
*  I started hearing about it, but like well before it came out, like, Hey, there's [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6685.4800000000005s)]
*  this show we have, it's, it has a chance. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6689.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6692.84s)]
*  I knew, you know, because the show was so different, right? [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6693.24s)]
*  It's so out there and it's really just, you know, it's a lot of [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6696.88s)]
*  conversations around the table. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6700.24s)]
*  And it's, it's, there's not a lot of plot until episode five, when [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6702.04s)]
*  the robbery happens, nothing really happens. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6705.28s)]
*  But there's two genius things though. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6707.799999999999s)]
*  One is that you don't know where it's going and you kind of want to see. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6709.28s)]
*  But the other thing that plays into the COVID piece, you got to go on [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6713.04s)]
*  vacation to Hawaii, which was great. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6716.799999999999s)]
*  You just got to go somewhere that wasn't like your house with the same family or [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6719.44s)]
*  friends that you were just staring at for the last nine months. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6723.2s)]
*  And just being completely honest, we didn't think the murder mystery [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6726.44s)]
*  element would be a thing and we were cutting the pilot and we got a note [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6730.16s)]
*  actually about like, cause in the pilot episode, you introduced this idea. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6734.92s)]
*  Jake Lace is there talking about the dead body and we got a note, like maybe [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6740.679999999999s)]
*  bring that back at the end to call it back. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6743.719999999999s)]
*  And I remember we were talking about it like, Oh, well, people aren't [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6746.839999999999s)]
*  going to really, really care about the murder mystery. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6748.64s)]
*  So calling it back would kind of feel, it's not really about that. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6751.320000000001s)]
*  And so it was just like, it was just like a creative thing that happened [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6754.320000000001s)]
*  and people kind of latched onto it. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6757.56s)]
*  And, and for me, it was really exciting because it was a way into what was [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6758.92s)]
*  ultimately a story about existential ideas and being a human in this complexity [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6763.200000000001s)]
*  of life and, and I knew it's what you, I made the show and I also haven't, I've [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6768.72s)]
*  never talked about this, but I went to show three friends of mine. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6774.68s)]
*  And they were the first people I showed the show to. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6778.4800000000005s)]
*  And I showed them a locked version of the pilot. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6780.84s)]
*  I had temp music and my friends were like, and they're three, they're [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6783.8s)]
*  filmmaker friends, I trust them. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6788.6s)]
*  And they look at me and they go, this show's not good. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6790.96s)]
*  And they're go, there's not good. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6792.92s)]
*  And I go, what do you mean? [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6794.280000000001s)]
*  They're like, yeah, this is not a good show. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6794.84s)]
*  They're like, what are you going to do? [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6796.52s)]
*  What, you know, I'm like, and I'm like, I laughed and I was kind of [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6797.6s)]
*  disheartened and one of my friends called me and he'll, he's definitely [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6800.56s)]
*  going to listen to this interview. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6804.4800000000005s)]
*  He knows who he is and he's like, the show's really not good. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6805.04s)]
*  It's not a good show. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6808.16s)]
*  And I don't know. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6809.08s)]
*  And I'm just like, I didn't really listen to them. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6809.88s)]
*  And then the only thing that changed was the music. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6812.16s)]
*  And that's the show we kind of locked and we, we, that aired and, and I still [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6815.64s)]
*  make fun of my friends obviously to this day about it, but I knew the show was [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6819.32s)]
*  going to work when we would show people agents first, like agents of clients. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6822.6s)]
*  And they would call me and they go, give me the next one. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6828.4s)]
*  I need the next episode. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6830.4s)]
*  So I go, okay, I'll see you next time. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6831.64s)]
*  And they're like, give me the next episode. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6832.36s)]
*  I need the next episode. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6833.72s)]
*  Right. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6834.44s)]
*  And at that point I was like, oh, there's something here that [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6835.0s)]
*  people are kind of hooking into. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6836.919999999999s)]
*  And, you know, there's, we could never have predicted it would be a success. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6838.919999999999s)]
*  And let alone we could do three seasons and, you know, fourth season and, and [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6843.679999999999s)]
*  feel very fortunate that HBO trusted us. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6847.799999999999s)]
*  And they just trusted in Mike and they were, there was no notes in the creative [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6850.44s)]
*  process because there was no time. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6853.32s)]
*  They just said, go make it. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6854.879999999999s)]
*  And we went off and made something and brought it back to them. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6856.5599999999995s)]
*  And, and, you know, Casey and Franny and Norris Skinner at HBO, they'd [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6858.879999999999s)]
*  just known us for a long time and they deserve great credit for just [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6863.0s)]
*  trusting in the creative process. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6866.24s)]
*  I remember texting Casey about it. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6867.72s)]
*  Like we're, we're season two. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6870.0s)]
*  And he's like, Mike's never doing a season. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6871.44s)]
*  There's no way. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6873.36s)]
*  I was like, how do you not do a season two? [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6874.08s)]
*  Just go to a different location. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6875.68s)]
*  He's like, yeah, we know, but Mike's that's not how he operates. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6877.28s)]
*  He's not going to do it. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6880.2s)]
*  So what changed? [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6881.16s)]
*  I think the response to the show and I think we just had fun and, you know, the [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6882.48s)]
*  show really comes out of Mike's passion for travel, you know, he was on amazing [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6886.72s)]
*  race, did two seasons, he just loves to travel. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6890.0s)]
*  Was he a survivor too? [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6892.32s)]
*  Yeah, he was. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6893.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6893.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6894.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6894.36s)]
*  I mean, in so much of the show is survivor. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6894.5599999999995s)]
*  I was going to ask you about that. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6897.08s)]
*  It does feel like survivor and white Lotus are not even cousins. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6898.28s)]
*  They might be siblings. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6902.48s)]
*  Well, that's a, there's a great story of how Mike ended up on, well, I mean, [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6903.4s)]
*  originally Mike and I applied to CBS for amazing race. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6906.48s)]
*  We went, we were wearing matching blue floor jumpsuits. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6909.5199999999995s)]
*  We shot a stupid video running around, running around Brentwood. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6912.84s)]
*  I drove down to El Segundo. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6917.799999999999s)]
*  I dropped it in the box because Mike and I both love the show and I was Mike's [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6919.12s)]
*  assistant and we had this idea of like, it would be funny if we went on the show [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6922.04s)]
*  together. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6924.84s)]
*  CBS called two weeks later and they recast me. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6925.56s)]
*  They're like, your dynamic is too Hollywood. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6929.4s)]
*  We don't really like the dynamic. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6932.36s)]
*  And eventually Mike ended up with his dad going on amazing race, but it was through [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6933.48s)]
*  that experience. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6937.12s)]
*  He ended up on survivor because he's like, Mike is really competitive in a great [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6937.64s)]
*  way. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6941.56s)]
*  And I think he just like, he didn't win amazing race and eventually like, I'm [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6941.84s)]
*  going to, I'm going to win survivor. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6945.76s)]
*  But I think, I think at the end of season one, we just had such a great experience [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6947.36s)]
*  making the show. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6954.36s)]
*  And like I was saying before, Mike is really the star of white lotus. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6956.24s)]
*  And I think the anthology dynamic allows Mike to be the star and allow us not to [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6959.2s)]
*  be beholden to anyone else's schedule. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6964.2s)]
*  And it's all on Mike in the writing. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6966.5199999999995s)]
*  And Casey came to us to Casey's credit and said, I want to make anything you want [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6968.8s)]
*  to make next. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6972.88s)]
*  And Mike said, let's do season two of white lotus. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6974.04s)]
*  And they greenlit it without hearing Mike's idea. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6976.24s)]
*  Again, they didn't know location. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6979.24s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6980.76s)]
*  We didn't know location. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6981.44s)]
*  I mean, I get asked all the time about the locations. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6982.8s)]
*  The location process is really organic. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6985.44s)]
*  And, but it was a lot easier for season two, I'm guessing. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6988.2s)]
*  Well, yeah, no, I mean, yes. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6991.12s)]
*  Easier to find places to give us hotels. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6992.719999999999s)]
*  To be like, yeah, come here. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6994.5599999999995s)]
*  But it was still hard. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6997.04s)]
*  It was actually, we, I thought we were going to shoot in France and we went to [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=6997.719999999999s)]
*  Italy as a courtesy to HBO because it was an other country, had a great rebate, [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7001.2s)]
*  better rebate than France. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7004.44s)]
*  We go and we basically saw these crazy heads everywhere in Sicily and Palermo. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7005.759999999999s)]
*  And this guy told us the story of what these heads meant to Tessa DeMoros. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7011.04s)]
*  And they tell us a story about this guy who was having an affair and the woman [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7014.4s)]
*  chopped his head off. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7018.08s)]
*  And Mike kind of got inspired by this idea of doing a show about sexual [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7019.44s)]
*  jealousy in Sicily ended up being the perfect place. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7022.679999999999s)]
*  Um, [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7026.04s)]
*  there would have been good title, sexual jealousy. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7026.5599999999995s)]
*  That's a good title for like a Cinemax movie. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7028.5199999999995s)]
*  Let's you and I sell that. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7030.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7031.48s)]
*  But I mean, season three is like a [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7032.32s)]
*  Shane and Tweed, but now in 2025, [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7033.88s)]
*  just go with us. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7036.92s)]
*  But I mean, season three was actually amazing. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7038.04s)]
*  We were going to shoot in Japan and we went to Thailand as a courtesy to HBO. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7039.4800000000005s)]
*  It's the only other country in Southeast Asia that had a rebate that was like [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7044.6s)]
*  film friendly and we were in Chiang Mai in the North and Mike got bronchitis. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7047.88s)]
*  And he went to the hospital and the nurses there took such great care of him. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7053.32s)]
*  And he kind of fell in love with Thailand and he, they put him on this thing [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7057.68s)]
*  called a nebulizer and it's this really strong steroid. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7060.72s)]
*  And he was up for two nights and he hallucinated and he hallucinated season [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7064.36s)]
*  three of white lotus and he gets in the van the next day and he pitches me what [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7069.0s)]
*  he hallucinated and that's what we shot. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7072.84s)]
*  What? [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7074.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7075.28s)]
*  And we were like, we're shooting in Thailand. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7075.88s)]
*  So by the time we left Thailand, we went to Japan. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7078.0s)]
*  We knew we were shooting in Thailand and Thailand itself was like such a [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7080.52s)]
*  witchy place and you were there for how many months? [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7084.6s)]
*  Like almost a year. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7088.2s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7089.4800000000005s)]
*  But I love it. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7090.24s)]
*  But yeah, that was when I got to know you a little bit and it was, you were [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7090.64s)]
*  just out of it. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7093.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7094.2s)]
*  I mean, how do you, you couldn't follow sports in the same way? [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7094.72s)]
*  Like nothing. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7098.2s)]
*  I mean, do you remember one of our first Zooms? [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7098.76s)]
*  I thought my dad, I don't even remember this. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7100.48s)]
*  We had like a 5 a.m. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7103.0s)]
*  Zoom because it was the only time that worked for all of our, the [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7104.12s)]
*  first time we ever met. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7106.72s)]
*  And, and I woke up to like a message that my dad was in the hospital. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7107.48s)]
*  I don't remember this. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7111.48s)]
*  And I get on the Zoom and we're meeting for the first time. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7112.08s)]
*  And like I said, I'm, I'm a huge fan of yours and I was so excited to meet you. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7113.599999999999s)]
*  So I didn't want to cancel our Zoom. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7117.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7118.639999999999s)]
*  And I woken up like three minutes before a Zoom and I get on and I'm like, um, [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7119.08s)]
*  I'm like really shaken. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7123.0s)]
*  And you're like, we can reschedule. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7124.280000000001s)]
*  Like, yeah, deal with your dad. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7125.92s)]
*  My dad was okay. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7127.84s)]
*  But, um, but yeah, I mean, I think, uh, that was a tough year for all of us. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7128.8s)]
*  Like just like the time zones and being away from family and I would, I mean, [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7133.12s)]
*  Mosquitoes? [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7137.12s)]
*  Um, and the mosquitoes were insane. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7138.04s)]
*  We all, we all had got dengue shots and a couple of people got dengue. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7140.08s)]
*  At that point, you're like, it's a crap shoot. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7143.6s)]
*  You know, do you, will you get dengue? [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7146.16s)]
*  Will you end up in the hospital? [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7147.68s)]
*  Like I would, I would go to work. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7148.8s)]
*  Like I was like, yeah, in the 1980s Lakers, like I would have socks up to my knees. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7150.64s)]
*  I don't like, like, like, like Michael Cooper. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7154.68s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7157.160000000001s)]
*  Honestly. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7157.84s)]
*  So you're worried about monsoons, mosquitoes, there's always the tsunami [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7158.320000000001s)]
*  thing, which is, you know, by the way, not, not a theme season three, but it's [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7162.4800000000005s)]
*  coming. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7167.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7168.12s)]
*  So I was coming. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7168.4800000000005s)]
*  Um, but yeah, I've been watching sports with the hardest cause I, I'm a [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7169.320000000001s)]
*  diehard Lakers fan. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7171.96s)]
*  I would be on set and this is, this is like the buildup to the playoffs. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7173.240000000001s)]
*  We're like nugget series. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7177.4s)]
*  And I would, I didn't miss a Lakers game. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7179.04s)]
*  I had like VPN. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7181.32s)]
*  I got the ticket. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7182.8s)]
*  I watched every single Lakers game on set, regular season playoffs, and I would [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7183.4800000000005s)]
*  be at the monitors and I'm a really vocal fan. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7187.12s)]
*  So I'm there and like, you know, watching the nugget series, Joker's hitting like [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7191.24s)]
*  these fucking ridiculous shots over his head, three pointers fall, you know, [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7195.4800000000005s)]
*  falling out of bounds. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7198.68s)]
*  And I'm like yelling on set. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7199.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7201.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm not joking. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7202.12s)]
*  Literally. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7202.64s)]
*  If you ask any actor from white lotus season three about this, like I'm [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7203.12s)]
*  literally at the maniac. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7206.68s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7207.88s)]
*  I'm at the monitors with my iPad watching what's shooting, watching both the same [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7208.4800000000005s)]
*  time yelling uncontrollably at Jamal Murray, who I fucking hate as a Lakers [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7212.0s)]
*  kind of blow that series. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7217.76s)]
*  I should have won that series. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7218.76s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, sports, I would wake up at like all, all like crazy hours. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7220.04s)]
*  When it missed Lakers. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7224.76s)]
*  And the problem solving. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7225.8s)]
*  So it sounds like Italy was probably the easiest of the three seasons. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7227.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7231.240000000001s)]
*  But why is the hardest and then Thailand's just a wild card every day. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7231.4800000000005s)]
*  Wild card. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7234.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7235.360000000001s)]
*  Why was the hardest just because of COVID and like, also like you didn't know [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7235.8s)]
*  what COVID was at that point, like how dangerous it was. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7238.68s)]
*  And I'm a producer. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7240.92s)]
*  I'm not like an epidemiologist and people are looking at you like, Oh, you're a [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7242.200000000001s)]
*  producer. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7246.280000000001s)]
*  You should have the cure for COVID or no, you know, so like people are coming to me [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7246.56s)]
*  for COVID advice, like plus producing advice. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7250.6s)]
*  So it was, it was a very tough spot to be in. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7253.400000000001s)]
*  And season three, we got and got more into a groove, just the elements of Thailand, [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7256.280000000001s)]
*  the heat, mosquitoes. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7259.8s)]
*  You said it's your favorite season. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7261.52s)]
*  It's the best season. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7262.8s)]
*  I'm really excited for people to watch it. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7263.799999999999s)]
*  And your three friends think it's another shitty season. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7265.839999999999s)]
*  By the way, of course, it's really slowly paced. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7268.4s)]
*  It really sucks. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7270.2s)]
*  By the way, you know, our dear friend, Michael Lasker, who I love, he called me [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7271.16s)]
*  last night and he was like, yeah, I love the season. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7275.24s)]
*  I'm on a text thread with people. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7277.759999999999s)]
*  They're talking about how slow it is. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7278.879999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, one, why are you telling me this? [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7279.919999999999s)]
*  You know, Lasker, you can't help him uncontrollably. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7284.719999999999s)]
*  You can't help him. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7286.719999999999s)]
*  So that's, he's got opinions. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7287.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7288.4s)]
*  But you know, it's, it's annoying to hear people go, Oh, it's so slow. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7288.839999999999s)]
*  Because each season is paced the same way. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7293.48s)]
*  But what I like, it's not slow. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7296.16s)]
*  You need to watch, unfortunately, and we have to do this for the recap pods. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7297.36s)]
*  You kind of have to watch them twice to kind of absorb everything that's in there. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7302.919999999999s)]
*  Cause it's like this dense, all this hidden shit going on and you can't just [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7307.799999999999s)]
*  like watch it while you're like on your phone. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7312.28s)]
*  Cause you know, like I honestly, like I love, I love, I love you. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7314.24s)]
*  I love the ringer. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7317.44s)]
*  I love, I listen to all the reviews of the things I do. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7318.32s)]
*  True. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7320.679999999999s)]
*  And so when you got, you texted me and you're like, Oh, I watched [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7321.0s)]
*  the first episode three times. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7323.28s)]
*  I told Mike White that I'm like, okay, it's going to be people are going to like it. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7324.4s)]
*  Bill watched it three times. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7327.92s)]
*  I mean, something's going on, but I, I'm really excited for people to see where it [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7329.6s)]
*  goes because it is completely unexpected. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7333.68s)]
*  It's a little demonic. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7336.76s)]
*  That's what Mike and I talk about. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7337.88s)]
*  It's the most demonic of all the seasons in the best way possible. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7339.0s)]
*  And I mean, see, we don't have to spoil episode three, but snakes, fires and [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7343.2s)]
*  tsunamis are some of the dream visuals. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7348.08s)]
*  Going on in the third episode. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7351.04s)]
*  And that's what's exciting is it had, the plot hasn't even really kicked in yet. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7352.84s)]
*  So there's so much unexpected stuff to come. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7357.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7360.72s)]
*  And I love the cast like, like Patrick Schwarzenegger, Jason Parker, the three [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7361.12s)]
*  women there, everyone is just great people. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7366.28s)]
*  It was a really, really, really amazing experience. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7369.08s)]
*  So you're almost doing like the Belichick salary cat move, or you're just getting [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7371.68s)]
*  these, getting these awesome veterans to be like the middle linebacker, but you [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7375.04s)]
*  don't have to like shoot your wad on Ryan Reynolds. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7379.6s)]
*  But because ultimately it comes back to what we were saying before, like Mike is [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7383.400000000001s)]
*  a star and it is kind of like, it's, it's kind of like, okay, see, like they have [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7386.240000000001s)]
*  this culture that they built. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7391.320000000001s)]
*  So I want this with someone other day, honestly, like with Tommy or our mutual [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7393.04s)]
*  friend, it is like, okay, see, he's building incredible culture around that team and [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7396.0s)]
*  people buy in. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7401.200000000001s)]
*  And that's kind of what we've tried to build with white Lotus, which is this is [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7402.52s)]
*  a show everyone. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7405.6s)]
*  You think LeBron's built that kind of culture? [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7406.360000000001s)]
*  Why didn't she use LeBron? [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7408.280000000001s)]
*  As an example, no comment. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7409.28s)]
*  And I think it's like Mike is a star. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7411.92s)]
*  It's Mike show and people are signing up and they're coming to do this show [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7413.4s)]
*  because they're believing in what we're making. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7417.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7419.08s)]
*  And everyone is at MFN. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7419.28s)]
*  Everyone's getting paid the same. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7420.8s)]
*  Everyone has the same trailer. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7422.28s)]
*  Everyone has the same exact status and across the board, all of us, and we're [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7423.5599999999995s)]
*  kind of, everyone is choosing to be there because they want to make a great show, [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7427.759999999999s)]
*  not because of the money, not because of anything else. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7431.36s)]
*  And you kind of feel that on set. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7433.679999999999s)]
*  It's really, it's funny. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7435.759999999999s)]
*  I was, I was, I was body language. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7437.16s)]
*  Bill is my favorite thing. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7440.0s)]
*  I've, I've, and I was, I was thinking about that as it relates to like actors [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7441.92s)]
*  and white Lotus in, in the casting process, you can kind of feel people's [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7445.8s)]
*  body language. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7449.24s)]
*  Really? [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7450.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7450.76s)]
*  Like that they're there because their agent told them to be there because they [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7451.48s)]
*  know it's a good show, but they don't actually watch it. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7455.12s)]
*  Why they're there and like how hard they're fighting for those parts. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7457.12s)]
*  And, and, and it's funny on set. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7459.8s)]
*  I was thinking about body language says so much. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7462.48s)]
*  I remember like, as I'm a Dyer Broncos fan, I remember going to see Jay Cutler [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7464.599999999999s)]
*  play live. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7468.759999999999s)]
*  And I just remember he threw like a, you know, a pick in the end zone and I [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7469.44s)]
*  remember his body language walking off the field. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7472.879999999999s)]
*  I'm like, Oh, he fucking sucks. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7474.639999999999s)]
*  I'm like, and I remember when they traded, I was so happy and like that, the body [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7476.08s)]
*  language says so much about people. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7479.959999999999s)]
*  And I was thinking about that as it relates to this season. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7481.36s)]
*  And this was a really hard show to make with the elements in Thailand and people [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7483.919999999999s)]
*  were so committed and the body language and the energy every day was so good. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7488.759999999999s)]
*  And I think that comes through in the show and it comes through in people's [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7494.28s)]
*  performances. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7496.8s)]
*  And I think it comes through and by the end of the season, I hope people agree [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7497.4800000000005s)]
*  with me, but yeah, I do think it's the best season we've done. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7501.08s)]
*  And Mike's no help. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7503.52s)]
*  He's right in every single line. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7504.4800000000005s)]
*  Every single one. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7506.04s)]
*  I mean, well, Mike, I mean, Mike's, Mike's the genius. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7506.68s)]
*  Like, right. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7509.32s)]
*  But it's, it was funny. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7509.96s)]
*  Cause at one point when they were during like one of the ride, I forget when the [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7510.88s)]
*  writer's strike was, and one of the things they were talking about how, Oh, [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7514.04s)]
*  this one, they don't have a writer's room. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7517.8s)]
*  It's like, yeah, cause it's like an eight hour movie. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7519.32s)]
*  He doesn't need a fucking writer's room. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7521.64s)]
*  But also like, this is a thing. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7523.04s)]
*  And I, you know, Mike, I've been working with Mike for 20 years. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7524.48s)]
*  Mike is authentically himself. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7529.72s)]
*  And I think like the key to being successful, I think as a producer or [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7532.52s)]
*  writer is knowing your strengths, knowing your weaknesses. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7536.28s)]
*  Mike's weakness is being in a room with writers and Mike's weakness for him. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7539.76s)]
*  That's just not how he approaches the creative process. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7545.44s)]
*  And he's not critical or judgmental of anyone else's process. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7548.64s)]
*  Right. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7552.44s)]
*  But the thing he had a mental break the last time you were in a room, he had a [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7552.76s)]
*  mental breakdown and ended up in a mental hospital and he talks about it a lot. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7556.280000000001s)]
*  And that was because of the process for him. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7559.92s)]
*  He just doesn't, he doesn't exist in that process. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7562.56s)]
*  Well, why wouldn't people just think of it as a seven hour movie, which is what it is. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7565.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7568.96s)]
*  And of course, and he, what Mike is saying is anyone can do whatever they want. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7569.280000000001s)]
*  I just need to do my process. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7572.8s)]
*  And he was like, I'm never returning to TV and he returned to TV to do enlightened [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7574.320000000001s)]
*  because HBO said to him, you don't need to have a writer's room. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7578.96s)]
*  You can do it on your terms. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7581.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7582.959999999999s)]
*  And that's how I was able to do it. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7583.48s)]
*  And so I think Mike, um, yeah, I mean, like what he does, I don't know how he does it. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7584.44s)]
*  And he's again, like it's, he's a genius and the two people, I don't know how they [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7590.08s)]
*  do it or him and Taylor Sheridan. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7594.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7596.36s)]
*  I don't understand how Taylor Sheridan is producing this much content. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7596.759999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7600.28s)]
*  It really does feel like, like I made the limitless joke before, but he really does [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7600.839999999999s)]
*  feel like the limitless, like we're going to find out he found some sort of something [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7604.4s)]
*  that he's going to, he has an adderall addiction and he's going to go to rehab at [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7609.24s)]
*  some point in the next five years. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7611.96s)]
*  I don't know how he does it. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7614.32s)]
*  His body naturally produces adderall. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7615.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7616.88s)]
*  By the way, there's something going on with him. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7617.28s)]
*  I think, but Mike, you know, Mike is focused on one thing. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7618.92s)]
*  He wants to do one thing really well. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7621.32s)]
*  He doesn't want to spread himself thin. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7623.48s)]
*  And I think that all saying no, kind of we're talking about at the [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7624.68s)]
*  beginning is a superpower of his. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7627.28s)]
*  He knows his limits and he has to focus on one thing and he pours. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7629.24s)]
*  That's the thing that people don't realize. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7633.92s)]
*  He pours every inch of his life into making white lotus at the cost of personal [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7634.96s)]
*  friendships, family, and he cares about every, we'll be in a mix in episode four [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7641.4400000000005s)]
*  of the season, you know, and he will hear something and he will, he's so focused on [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7648.4400000000005s)]
*  the attention to details that nobody else is thinking about. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7653.64s)]
*  So is the number one thing that happens to you at the show, people suggesting [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7656.96s)]
*  locations for the next season? [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7660.92s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7662.4400000000005s)]
*  Like that or my other favorite thing is if my wife came in right now, she'd be [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7663.16s)]
*  like, why don't you guys do a skiing season? [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7667.04s)]
*  By the way, go to like Switzerland, but doesn't like the cold. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7669.2s)]
*  That's why we'll never do it. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7671.599999999999s)]
*  So we'll never do it. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7673.28s)]
*  I can, I feel confident. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7673.88s)]
*  We'll never do a season in the cold, but you're not going to do a ski season. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7674.84s)]
*  I, he just, Mike is, Mike's not built for, he's a California guy. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7677.96s)]
*  He's not built for the cold, but never say never, but I would be surprised. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7681.84s)]
*  But yeah, I think part of the best part or one of the best parts of my job now is [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7686.72s)]
*  hotels are calling me because they're like, Mike, Mike says, I got the runoff. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7692.759999999999s)]
*  Mike says, no, definitely work with that. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7698.0s)]
*  Italy hotel became, it became like one of the hottest hotels in the world. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7699.5599999999995s)]
*  But like, I'm telling you, every hotel is now offering to fly us to see the hotel. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7703.12s)]
*  So I get Mike's runoff, Mike, they'll offer to Mike, Michael go no. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7707.0s)]
*  And the guy who's second. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7710.2s)]
*  Okay. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7711.2s)]
*  Let me go down the, down the call sheet. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7711.44s)]
*  So I'll get the phone calls and it'll be like, we'll send a plane. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7713.28s)]
*  We'll fly you to X city. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7716.08s)]
*  You're like a VIP at a casino. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7717.5199999999995s)]
*  They're sending you the private plane so you can come gamble there. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7719.679999999999s)]
*  Honestly, it's like, that's the, that's, and I love to travel. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7722.36s)]
*  So it's like, so now it's like, how do I say yes to all these things? [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7724.5599999999995s)]
*  And I think the next couple of months, I'm going to be flying all over the country [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7727.24s)]
*  and looking at all over the world, looking at hotels. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7730.16s)]
*  And do you figure out the location first or do you figure out the idea? [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7732.48s)]
*  And that's kind of what I was saying about, about Thailand story. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7736.08s)]
*  It, I think there's a, first is the theme. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7738.96s)]
*  Like we knew season three, one, it kind of explore Eastern philosophy and kind [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7741.5199999999995s)]
*  of bigger existential religious ideas. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7745.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7748.599999999999s)]
*  And so we knew it had to be Asia and we didn't really land on the [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7749.0s)]
*  series until we landed on Thailand. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7752.36s)]
*  And I'm not exaggerating. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7754.24s)]
*  Mike hallucinated the season. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7755.2s)]
*  And so it came very organically. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7757.16s)]
*  Um, and so I think season four, we have, I know what the themes are. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7759.84s)]
*  I won't talk about it, but so I know we have, [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7763.2s)]
*  Oh, so you know it. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7765.0s)]
*  Okay. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7765.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7766.08s)]
*  We have a general concept and then we'll go scout cities that could [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7767.12s)]
*  make sense for that general concept. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7773.08s)]
*  And I think the season will present itself once we land in sea hotels. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7774.88s)]
*  So Mike could be like season four is about adultery. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7779.200000000001s)]
*  That's, that's what I'm excited about. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7782.4400000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7784.56s)]
*  Let's think about locations that would be a good adultery location. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7785.080000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7788.76s)]
*  But it's funny though, cause Mike, part of his genius as a writer, [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7789.120000000001s)]
*  he's always paying attention. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7792.360000000001s)]
*  For example, you know, uh, we were in Bangkok and I went and had drinks with [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7793.92s)]
*  someone we were scouting and this person was talking to me about these like [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7798.400000000001s)]
*  bald guys who come to Thailand and they're like dating these young women. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7803.84s)]
*  And she's like, yeah, they're called, we call them LBHs. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7807.360000000001s)]
*  We just filing it away. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7809.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7811.28s)]
*  And so I go in the, I go in the van the next day and I'm like, so funny [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7811.4800000000005s)]
*  about this girl and I was out and, um, she was talking about LBHs, losers [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7814.24s)]
*  back home, and I just kind of say it as a funny anecdote, Mike, Mike files [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7819.6s)]
*  that away and then it pops up episode one, LBHs and you know, he's always [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7824.0s)]
*  paying attention and he's always kind of just like observing and there's so [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7828.400000000001s)]
*  many things that happen in the show that I'm like, I think maybe somehow I [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7833.52s)]
*  unintentionally or somebody in our group unintentionally inspired it and whether [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7838.280000000001s)]
*  he's making fun of us or, you know, unclear. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7841.4800000000005s)]
*  So that's it. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7845.0s)]
*  So if he does season four, there's a podcaster will feel like he's making fun [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7846.360000000001s)]
*  of maybe this podcast we're doing right now. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7850.52s)]
*  Somehow some character will end up on a podcast. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7853.6s)]
*  Me. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7855.200000000001s)]
*  So that's what I'm saying. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7856.400000000001s)]
*  He'll have a general concept. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7856.92s)]
*  We'll go travel and then ideas will sprout and it'll kind of focus where we're [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7858.0s)]
*  heading and what he's writing. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7863.24s)]
*  This is the part of the podcast where I pitch a white Lotus character for some [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7864.639999999999s)]
*  season and it's awkward and you end up not doing it. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7868.84s)]
*  I just feel like an NBA player going on vacation is the all time just sitting [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7874.719999999999s)]
*  their idea, which then you could really get involved with. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7879.0s)]
*  I don't know if Mike cares, but these, I was thinking about it during all star [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7881.44s)]
*  break, all these guys went away and they went like a couple of guys you could see [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7885.12s)]
*  like, we're like almost a little sunburned, but I was thinking like this [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7888.719999999999s)]
*  is where I would love white Lotus to go one year is have like a basketball star [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7891.88s)]
*  and we can all try to guess what pieces of stars you took to make this star. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7895.96s)]
*  What did you see Luke, the video of Luca banging three, like he took also break [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7900.0s)]
*  to go off and just start banging threes. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7903.08s)]
*  Right. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7905.44s)]
*  He went to Cabo, right? [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7905.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7907.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7907.12s)]
*  Just banging. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7907.639999999999s)]
*  It's funny because no matter how successful I am in Hollywood film TV, [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7908.08s)]
*  meeting an athlete and the athlete is still the thrill of my life. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7913.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7916.72s)]
*  So I love this idea as an excuse to just to hang out with that. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7917.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7920.639999999999s)]
*  And then it's like, do we get a real athlete? [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7920.919999999999s)]
*  Do we get a fake athlete? [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7922.639999999999s)]
*  Cause the other one I was thinking was quarterbacks would be a good one too. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7923.759999999999s)]
*  During the off season, they go away, they bring whoever and you could have the [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7926.96s)]
*  guy brings his wife, but also his girlfriend staying somewhere else in the hotel. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7930.759999999999s)]
*  And you got that whole thing going. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7936.12s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you a funny story, which is season one white [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7937.48s)]
*  Lotus we're in Maui four seasons. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7940.32s)]
*  Maybe you know this, maybe you don't, which is that is like the Lakers hotel. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7942.599999999999s)]
*  So like, so I am a, it's like, if I did [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7945.599999999999s)]
*  now, I'm never going there. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7948.96s)]
*  But I'm going to say like magic Johnson is my idol. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7950.919999999999s)]
*  I like grew up writing letters to him when he retired. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7954.5599999999995s)]
*  I bought, I was like inconsolable. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7957.36s)]
*  Like I had to, I think I skipped school. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7958.919999999999s)]
*  He is my hero. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7961.599999999999s)]
*  And if I had to like liken myself really to a basketball player [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7962.879999999999s)]
*  as a producer, it's magic Johnson. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7966.799999999999s)]
*  Unselfish. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7968.24s)]
*  Unselfish. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7969.04s)]
*  So we are at the four seasons and I think somehow we hear that magic [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7969.799999999999s)]
*  Johnson is staying at the hotel. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7975.12s)]
*  And I tell Natasha Rothwell and I tell Jennifer Coolidge, Oh my God. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7976.96s)]
*  I mean, magic Johnson is my, I don't, my little brother is there. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7980.2s)]
*  And my little brother knows better than anyone, John, how much I love magic Johnson. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7982.72s)]

*  Like I can't do it. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7995.28s)]
*  The next day I'm on set and I get a call from Jennifer Coolidge. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=7996.599999999999s)]

*  I run down the lobby. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8017.28s)]
*  I'm just sitting in the lobby now. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8018.24s)]
*  I'm like, this is my one moment to be my Johnson. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8019.68s)]
*  And there comes magic Johnson with cookie and he's with the manager who I've gotten [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8021.72s)]
*  to know, and so I go up to me, I go up and I introduce myself and I'm now the 11 [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8024.64s)]
*  year old version of myself. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8030.36s)]

*  Like, who are you? [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8047.16s)]
*  What do you do? [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8047.96s)]
*  And I basically tell him, I'm so I tell him, like I'm producing a show, White Lotus. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8049.2s)]
*  And this point, no one knows what it is, you know, and I basically tell him how much [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8052.08s)]
*  he means to me. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8057.4s)]
*  And he's like, do you want to take a photo? [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8058.44s)]

*  And of course, it's not framed on my wall. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8061.08s)]
*  And I think to this day now, I'm like, I wonder if he's seen the show. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8063.24s)]
*  Oh, I, I promise you he's seen the show. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8067.0s)]
*  Magic watches all the TV. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8070.32s)]
*  But he must be like, because he must have been like, who the fuck is this idiot, the [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8072.36s)]
*  grown man talking to me like he's a little boy. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8076.72s)]
*  By the way, this happens to magic every day, like seven times a day. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8079.84s)]
*  So I watched it a bunch of times. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8083.0s)]
*  It was, but it was people, people melt into puddles when they talk to them. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8085.24s)]
*  It's incredibly. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8088.24s)]
*  Pussy's gigantic. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8088.88s)]

*  But it's also like, yeah, I'm like, I reflected on what I said to him. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8096.6s)]
*  Like, wow, what an idiot. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8100.36s)]

*  You've inspired me. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8111.16s)]
*  I don't know what the right sport is, but I feel like it has to be NBA or football. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8112.64s)]

*  biggest star in the world. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8193.960000000001s)]
*  So it kind of feel like I missed that a little bit, but Travis Kelsey is so [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8195.08s)]
*  funny, so charming, so personable when he's ready to kind of focus himself with [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8199.92s)]
*  acting, he's going to be a big star. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8204.28s)]
*  It would have been funny if you caught him like during white Lotus season one. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8205.6s)]
*  And he was just like, we're working for Murray Bartlett. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8209.28s)]
*  He was like the 20th guy in white Lotus just came down to Hawaii to hang out. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8211.6s)]
*  But that's, that's actually one thing I was like, I kind of feel like I'm now [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8216.68s)]
*  it's like so obvious, but I feel like I was a little early and then I missed that [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8219.68s)]
*  boat a little bit, but Travis Kelsey. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8223.28s)]
*  But I think he'll, when he wants to, he'll be a big star. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8224.800000000001s)]
*  He'll be John Cena. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8227.04s)]
*  John Cena is so funny, so talented. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8228.08s)]
*  And as that physicality of the stars that were, you know, eighties, nineties. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8231.04s)]
*  Did we hit everything? [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8234.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8236.640000000001s)]
*  That was like an hour. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8236.800000000001s)]
*  You can always come back. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8238.6s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8240.320000000002s)]
*  People like white Lotus season three. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8240.76s)]
*  They're happy with it. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8242.880000000001s)]
*  Except for your three buddies, those fucking assholes. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8243.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8245.880000000001s)]

*  Come on. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8249.84s)]
*  I don't look at rotten tomatoes. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8250.2s)]
*  Do you? [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8251.320000000002s)]
*  I know what I'm, if I was, it's pathetic how much I consume response to the show. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8251.880000000001s)]
*  Like I will, I don't know. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8258.44s)]
*  Like I will, I will sit on Twitter. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8260.08s)]
*  I'll read all the comments. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8262.560000000001s)]
*  Oh, don't do that. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8263.68s)]
*  I can't help it. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8264.92s)]
*  I'm also really, I'm actually really interested in people's theories on what [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8265.4s)]
*  happens this season and I'm kind of consumed by people's theories. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8268.640000000001s)]
*  It's really fun. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8273.48s)]
*  It's like, well, that's why we did the pod the way we did it this year. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8274.36s)]
*  Cause I love that the one at a time. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8276.960000000001s)]
*  That's the only way to do it. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8279.2s)]
*  You really have to like, Oh, I think, and then an episode later, you're completely [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8280.28s)]
*  wrong. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8284.04s)]
*  I'll be honest with you. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8284.640000000001s)]
*  I, I, and I mean this genuinely, I really value your opinion. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8285.44s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8289.24s)]
*  I do both on sports, but also on film and TV. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8289.880000000001s)]
*  And so I was really nervous to listen to the first episode, your ring, the, [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8293.16s)]
*  your episode about white lotus. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8296.68s)]
*  So other people listened to it and I asked, I was like, is it positive or negative? [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8298.04s)]
*  I didn't want to like, I just, I wanted to know it was okay. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8302.72s)]
*  Cause like, I care about what you think. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8305.4s)]
*  And so I was very excited to know that you liked the show. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8306.84s)]
*  I like going on vacation with shows and people being in the right hands of [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8310.36s)]
*  creators and that like, this show is perfect. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8314.16s)]
*  Cause like I've never been to Thailand and I'm never going, especially after [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8316.880000000001s)]
*  hearing some of the things that happened to you when you were there. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8319.6s)]
*  I'm just never going. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8321.44s)]
*  I told my wife, she's reconciled it. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8322.64s)]
*  She could take my daughter. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8324.64s)]
*  Well, you know, what's cool is you get to see a lot more of the, of the country. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8325.76s)]
*  As the show goes on the season and maybe, maybe we'll seduce you by the end. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8329.199999999999s)]
*  There's no safari. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8333.08s)]
*  That's not on the list, right? [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8335.36s)]
*  African safari, white lotus. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8336.6s)]
*  We talked about that. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8338.039999999999s)]
*  We talked about that as a potential. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8338.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8340.44s)]
*  Cause that's the great thing about the show. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8340.68s)]
*  You have all these locations. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8342.08s)]
*  You can go to fucking 10 seasons. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8343.32s)]
*  It's a dream, but also it's like, where do you want to live? [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8344.84s)]
*  Like lifestyle is part of the decision-making cause you're there for a [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8347.4s)]
*  year. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8351.36s)]
*  And so like, you know, we've talked about different continents and kind of. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8352.44s)]
*  Nothing in America though. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8355.800000000001s)]
*  Maybe we'll come back. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8357.560000000001s)]
*  We talked about it at some point. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8358.16s)]
*  Could do like Yellowstone, but that's then it's cold. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8359.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8362.0s)]
*  You know, different depends on time of year, but people, I know what's really [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8362.2s)]
*  fun, what's been fun about this season is also Thailand's a place that people [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8366.560000000001s)]
*  don't really know and they're familiar with it from like the hangover. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8370.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8373.32s)]
*  And it's been really amazing seeing the response and broadening the [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8374.0s)]
*  understanding of Thailand and Thai culture beyond the surface level, beyond [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8378.560000000001s)]
*  full moon party or sex tourism or whatever it is, which is an element of [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8383.08s)]
*  Thai culture, but it's not Thai culture. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8387.08s)]
*  And it's been really great to see a country that's, you know, that needed the [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8389.68s)]
*  exposure and they've really, you know, they've really responded to that in, in [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8393.960000000001s)]
*  they've been so, um, warm to us. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8398.44s)]
*  And Mike told me yesterday, he met the prime minister and came, he was like, [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8402.0s)]
*  if I asked him for a passport and assistantship, I feel like they'd give it to me. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8405.92s)]
*  But, you know, it's been really exciting to kind of put a, put a country on the [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8409.44s)]
*  map that hasn't really had that exposure. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8412.04s)]
*  And that's kind of maybe part of our calculus going forward. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8413.880000000001s)]
*  Also. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8416.68s)]
*  It's like, what's an undiscovered gem and what are places that people [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8417.0s)]
*  aren't that familiar with? [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8420.04s)]
*  All right. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8421.32s)]
*  We'll leave on these two things. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8421.48s)]
*  One, Luca. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8422.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8424.0s)]
*  You must be over the moon. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8425.04s)]
*  I, I remember, I mean, I, like everyone, it was like midnight, 12, oh five. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8426.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8430.880000000001s)]
*  I get a text from my little brother and he texted me something. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8431.04s)]
*  I was like, did like the Lakers die in a plane crash? [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8434.72s)]
*  Like what happened? [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8436.519999999999s)]
*  I was like, he just sent me basically, he's like, wow, Lakers. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8437.519999999999s)]
*  I was like, what does this mean? [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8439.56s)]
*  I go on ESPN and I'm like, it took a second because I love Anthony Davis. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8441.519999999999s)]
*  And I think he's so underappreciated. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8446.24s)]
*  Wow. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8447.56s)]
*  The Anthony Davis zag. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8447.72s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8449.32s)]
*  But, but I mean, like what the last, it was against the, the, the nuggets [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8449.92s)]
*  game, you're like, oh yeah, this team is going to be good. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8456.88s)]
*  And also just like, he plays like he's like magic Johnson. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8459.48s)]
*  Right. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8461.88s)]
*  He has, he just plays in the same way. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8462.119999999999s)]
*  That was bad. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8463.84s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8465.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8465.36s)]
*  Which I love. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8465.4s)]
*  I mean, he's already skinnier. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8465.68s)]
*  It took like a week. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8466.68s)]
*  Like it felt like he already lost like five times. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8467.56s)]
*  It's like the ultimate, it's like Liam Neeson and Taken. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8469.76s)]
*  Like they've basically, he's basically like, I'm going to, I'm going the next [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8471.6s)]
*  15 years, he's basically going to fuck the league up and as a Lakers fan, as [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8475.72s)]
*  someone who goes to games, I am so excited to see him play. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8479.52s)]
*  I was, I had tickets to that, that Saturday game where we thought [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8482.6s)]
*  that Lico was going to play. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8486.84s)]
*  And I like, I had canceled all these plans. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8487.72s)]
*  I got, I had tickets and I was ready to go. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8489.92s)]
*  And then the last second, they, they moved his like his first game to the 10th, [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8491.68s)]
*  which was the white Lotus premiere. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8495.880000000001s)]
*  And for like five seconds, I'm like, do I skip my own premiere to go see Lico play? [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8497.800000000001s)]
*  It's like, is that something I do? [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8502.800000000001s)]
*  But, but yeah, I'm very excited about Lucas. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8503.960000000001s)]
*  It's exciting to be in LA for them. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8506.0s)]
*  So your life is basically people talking about the Luka trade with you, people [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8507.52s)]
*  suggesting white Lod, white Lotus locations, and then people trying to set you up. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8511.04s)]
*  That's it. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8515.800000000001s)]
*  Those are your three things. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8516.24s)]
*  Honestly, that's, that's it. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8517.28s)]
*  That's genuinely like consuming way too much. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8518.68s)]
*  But white Lotus is a hot show. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8521.960000000001s)]

*  I've heard rumors. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cd3LtDjFeQ&t=8525.960000000001s)]
