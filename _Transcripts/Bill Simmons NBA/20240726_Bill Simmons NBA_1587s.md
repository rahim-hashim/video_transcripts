# Bill Simmons's 2024 Paris Olympics Bets | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [July 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0)
*  All right. We had to do this. The Olympics are starting this weekend. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=0.0s)]
*  Joe house is here 20 years ago before podcasts. I think we're invented. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=3.44s)]
*  Joe house and I bet on Argentina to win the gold medal [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=9.0s)]
*  at the 2000 and for basketball part of the Olympics. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=14.24s)]
*  They were 10 to one odds. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=18.44s)]
*  We did not put a small amount on it and they won and we rooted against our [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  country, but that's how strongly we felt about the team they put together. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=23.32s)]
*  House all bets are off with us from a patriotism standpoint. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=26.72s)]
*  Our patriotism, our flag is just green. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=30.0s)]
*  We wave a green flag and that's it. And I'm not a [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=33.32s)]
*  We're capitalists. I mean, I think it is patriotic. We believe in capitalism. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=35.76s)]
*  And yet I'm, I think the USA team will win. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=41.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=45.36s)]
*  I don't feel awesome about betting against them, but we might've done a couple [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  hedges. So let's just go through it. We're going to talk about Olympic basketball [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=50.64s)]
*  only. That's the only thing we know about and some of the value we see. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=54.0s)]
*  So gold medal, USA minus seven 50, Canada's 10 to one France, 15 to one, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  Serbia, 15 to one Germany, 28 to one. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=63.6s)]
*  We dabbled on France at 15 to one, make the case. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, the defense that they are going to be able to bring the table, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=70.96s)]
*  both in terms of rim protection, but more importantly, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=75.32s)]
*  in terms of the perimeter and it's not just the notion of go bear as rim [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=78.8s)]
*  protector and Wemby covering side to side playing free safety. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=83.72s)]
*  Cool. Bali is a bad ass defender, a bad ass perimeter defender. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=88.72s)]
*  And so the theory is that that it'll be super hard to score [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=93.36s)]
*  against France. They're going to have the home cooking and, you know, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=98.32s)]
*  anything that goes weird will go in their favor. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=102.76s)]
*  Now it's not awesome that they. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=106.4s)]
*  What do you mean? What do you mean goes weird? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=108.16s)]
*  You mean like shady calls because the France crowd is going nuts. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=109.72s)]
*  I mean, did you watch the Moroccans run onto the field and the Morocco [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=113.28s)]
*  soccer game earlier this week? Like stuff goes weird. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=118.96s)]
*  Stuff is going to happen. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=121.84s)]
*  Interesting anyway. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=123.84s)]
*  So so the France piece, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=125.32s)]
*  I watched every minute of all the friendlies that the US team played. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=128.2s)]
*  And they made the decision to turn that to give the car keys to LeBron, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=134.12s)]
*  it seems like, for the for the Olympics. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  France is going to be a hard team from the size to just basically like [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=142.0s)]
*  try to drive like the type of team that I thought we were going to have, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  which was a little more driving kick and a little more guard friendly outside [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=149.76s)]
*  shooting. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=153.11999999999998s)]
*  The USA was playing way more power stuff than I was expecting. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=155.11999999999998s)]
*  There was a lot of post-ups of Embiid, there was post-ups with LeBron, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=158.64s)]
*  and I'm not sure that's going to work against France when it seems like [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  France's guards are so bad. That would be our big advantage. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=166.32s)]
*  So I don't know that that matchup worries me, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=170.56s)]
*  but I think they're going to beat France. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=172.67999999999998s)]
*  The team that worries me for us is Germany. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=174.28s)]
*  Yes, we're on the same page. We didn't even compare notes on this. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=176.76s)]
*  Germany is 20 to one. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=180.76s)]
*  They could not be less afraid of the US Schroeder for some reason. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=183.36s)]
*  And this goes back to a couple of years ago, the Warriors, the Warriors Lakers [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=189.04s)]
*  series, like Schroeder loves playing against Curry. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=193.0s)]
*  I would say Schroeder is the number one guy against Curry. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  So if Curry is going to be like a crunch time guy, Schroeder is like, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=198.28s)]
*  that's great. I love playing against this guy. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=200.72s)]
*  The Wagnars, completely unafraid. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=203.6s)]
*  They have that shooter, Opst, who kills them. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=206.11999999999998s)]
*  I think it's Opst. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=208.39999999999998s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=210.32s)]
*  The guy who murdered them in the World Championships. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=211.32s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=214.16s)]
*  I just kind of liked the team. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  They had size. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=218.2s)]
*  Danny Tice. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=219.16s)]
*  Yeah, still some bulk in the middle. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=220.16s)]
*  They have that nice compliment. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=222.64s)]
*  So the FIBA basketball style, you have to have some size, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=224.48s)]
*  which is why you look at somebody like Canada. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=228.27999999999997s)]
*  You're like, and the one that we get in enough juice, they don't really have [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=231.60000000000002s)]
*  that great insight. You better have some inside presence. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=235.72000000000003s)]
*  And that's part of the thesis for France. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=238.76000000000002s)]
*  Their guards are terrible. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  But Germany has size. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  I'm not worried about size with Germany. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  Germany has size and guys that have played together for a while. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=246.56s)]
*  What are they like a seven, eight man rotation? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=250.8s)]
*  Yes. And they're really comfortable with each other. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=253.28000000000003s)]
*  And they have the prototype of these teams that succeed [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=255.48000000000002s)]
*  in these international stuff where Schroeder just doesn't come out. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=259.91999999999996s)]
*  He plays the whole game. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=263.08s)]
*  Wagner slashed in the rim. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=264.52s)]
*  They have rebounders. They have offensive rebounders. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=266.32s)]
*  They have guys who know how to bat the ball off the rim the moment it gets there. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=268.55999999999995s)]
*  And they have a couple of shooters like I don't think I didn't actually think USA [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=271.59999999999997s)]
*  played that bad in the Germany game. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=276.4s)]
*  I just thought Germany was really comfortable and played really well against them. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=277.96s)]
*  And USA is my fear with them. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=281.64s)]
*  We have not talked about this at all. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=285.2s)]
*  I haven't even talked to you on the phone in a couple of weeks. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=286.4s)]
*  They they moved away from kind of what they thought this USA team was going to be. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=289.79999999999995s)]
*  There's a lot of guys who are like, yeah, maybe I should be playing crunch time. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=294.2s)]
*  You know, there there's. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=298.32s)]
*  I'm just there's some alpha stuff I'm just concerned about. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=300.84s)]
*  There's a lot of guys who seem like they're not being used exactly how they get used [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=304.03999999999996s)]
*  during the NBA season, and I'm not sure it's the best version. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=307.79999999999995s)]
*  And like Tatum was bad in the exhibition games, I thought. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=310.4s)]
*  He didn't have the ball a lot and he just didn't seem comfortable. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=314.4s)]
*  We have a threshold question. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=317.2s)]
*  Is KD playing? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=319.0s)]
*  Is KD definitely playing? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=320.32s)]
*  Because let's you know, we're going to start playing basketball. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=323.2s)]
*  The US's first game is Sunday and he hasn't played with this team at all. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=326.68s)]
*  That doesn't matter. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=330.68s)]
*  He's potentially the greatest Olympian in the history of the United States [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=331.72s)]
*  competing in Olympic basketball. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=336.04s)]
*  If he gets his fourth gold medal and he's a crucial [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=338.52s)]
*  player in previous gold medal runs. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=342.4s)]
*  But like we have a chemistry experiment going on here. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=345.08s)]
*  An ongoing chemistry experiment, which is why South Sudan was competitive [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=348.52s)]
*  and why Germany was competitive. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=353.44s)]
*  And your question is exactly the right question. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=355.71999999999997s)]
*  Who is the crunch time five and and who is going to feel comfortable [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=358.32s)]
*  with having their minutes diminished and be able to come in and still make an impact? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=363.4s)]
*  Because I, you know, we're looking at the props for players and I sort of put in our thread. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=367.68s)]
*  You know, what about this player or that player? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=372.2s)]
*  But the biggest question is, who's getting minutes and who's getting crunch time minutes? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=374.32s)]
*  So how do you allocate that? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=377.68s)]
*  Um, I think they're a little bit susceptible, right? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  A little bit susceptible, which is why you and I both have some exposure to a handful [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=381.92s)]
*  of countries that are not the United States of America. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=386.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=389.12s)]
*  I did the minutes thing on Sunday because I just think people kind of forget every four [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=389.36s)]
*  years how few minutes there are and how it's you're basically looking at four guys [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=394.0s)]
*  playing between 25, 28 minutes a game. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=399.8s)]
*  And then maybe three to four guys as the bench dudes. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=402.28000000000003s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=405.64s)]
*  Like I just, Edwards and Booker, one of those guys is going to lose. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=406.92s)]
*  If KD plays, I think Tatum's going to lose. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=411.32s)]
*  I think Tatum's going to lose minutes. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=414.52000000000004s)]
*  And I thought he was going to be the guaranteed mellow Wade six man spot, but he doesn't [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=415.96000000000004s)]
*  seem totally comfortable with it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=420.44s)]
*  They have a lot of guys who are used to having the ball all the time and they made the [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=422.28000000000003s)]
*  decision to give the car keys to LeBron and he looked good in those last two games. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=427.68s)]
*  But on the other hand, he had the ball a lot. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=431.72s)]
*  They barely beat South Sudan and they barely beat Germany. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=433.84000000000003s)]
*  And nobody else really looked that good. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=437.28000000000003s)]
*  So I think they're kind of stuck because I think they've made LeBron the point forward. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=439.40000000000003s)]
*  I don't like the way he looks with Embiid together. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=443.40000000000003s)]
*  I think they look too slow. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=445.68s)]
*  It's exactly the type of team, you know, they just, they're not playing with the right [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=447.16s)]
*  kind of pace and Kerr said this after the last game. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=451.52000000000004s)]
*  He's like, I don't like the way we're playing. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=455.08000000000004s)]
*  We're not, we don't have the same kind of pace that I thought we're going to play with [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=456.52000000000004s)]
*  because that LeBron and Embiid don't want to play that way. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=460.04s)]
*  So, you know, there's versions, five man versions that I watch where I'm like, that's it. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=463.92s)]
*  That's how they should be playing. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=469.40000000000003s)]
*  And I just don't know if they're going to be able to find the combinations in time. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=471.32s)]
*  So are they going to win? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=474.40000000000003s)]
*  I would say almost definitely. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=476.2s)]
*  Are they susceptible? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=477.8s)]
*  I think they are. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=478.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=480.32s)]
*  Fundamentally, they don't know who their nine man rotation is. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=480.84000000000003s)]
*  And I'm not sure they know who the final five are. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=485.96000000000004s)]
*  Do you feel like they know who the last five got? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=488.64s)]
*  Let's say they're playing Germany and they're down three with four minutes left. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=491.04s)]
*  Who's out there? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=494.32s)]
*  Definitely LeBron. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=495.92s)]
*  Definitely LeBron. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=498.0s)]
*  Definitely Anthony Davis. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=499.52s)]
*  But now you're sitting Embiid, which they were really hesitant. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=502.52s)]
*  They kept Embiid in that last game until there was like two minutes left and it was [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=505.56s)]
*  clear they needed to bring Davis in. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=509.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=513.24s)]
*  So I mean, my guess would be LeBron and Davis. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=513.48s)]
*  Steph. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=517.6s)]
*  Steph. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=519.52s)]
*  Edwards. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=520.76s)]
*  No, I think Drew's in there. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=522.28s)]
*  Wow. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=525.16s)]
*  I think, I think Edwards and Booker are out. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=525.52s)]
*  And then I think, I think Katie, if he's healthy is the fifth. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=527.8399999999999s)]
*  I think it's Katie and Drew and LeBron and Davis and Curry. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=530.88s)]
*  That team could lose. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=534.28s)]
*  If that's the crunch time, that team could definitely lose. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=535.9599999999999s)]
*  I don't think you can not have Drew out there though, because you either [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=539.04s)]
*  need him or White because of the defense. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=542.8399999999999s)]
*  One of those guys is going to have to chase Schroeder, name a [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=545.6s)]
*  international point card. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=549.64s)]
*  It's going to have to be one of those too. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=550.9599999999999s)]
*  SGA. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=552.52s)]
*  SGA. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=554.8s)]
*  So Canada, they're going to play Canada at some point potentially, and [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=555.4s)]
*  Canada is going to go small in them. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=558.48s)]
*  And Canada is going to be like, try to overpower us. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=560.28s)]
*  Great. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=563.1999999999999s)]
*  We'll give you baskets on that end, but we're going to try to race your dudes around. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=563.52s)]
*  If you watch them be really closely in the, in the friendlies, he couldn't [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=566.92s)]
*  jump out on shooters at all. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=570.88s)]
*  And the announcers were just missing it. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=572.28s)]
*  Like at one point, Germany just was, they got three straight threes right off them [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=573.92s)]
*  because they were just putting them in pick and rolls or trying to get him. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=578.96s)]
*  And they knew he couldn't run out in time. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=582.0s)]
*  And that's all Canada is going to do when they play him. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=584.0s)]
*  There's going to be like how, but the problem for Canada is they're just too small. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=586.64s)]
*  You mentioned it earlier. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=590.2s)]
*  Like, I feel like LeBron and Embiid could just overpower those guys. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=591.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=595.72s)]
*  The Tatum piece, the Tatum part is going to be really fascinating because he, he [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=597.0s)]
*  might play way less than I think people realize. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=603.72s)]
*  I think that makes sense to be honest with you. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=607.76s)]
*  It doesn't, you know, the, the, he just played 110 games, however many games it [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=610.16s)]
*  was the longest regular season, uh, comparable to the 2022 season for him. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=614.8s)]
*  It's a lot of basketball to go straight from that into training camp for the [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=621.3199999999999s)]
*  Olympic team and, and the Olympics. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=626.28s)]
*  But he's in good shape though. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=628.16s)]
*  The question for me is LeBron was the point forward on an eight seed that one, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=630.3199999999999s)]
*  one playoff game Tatum was basically the point forward on a team that went. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=636.28s)]
*  80, 81 and 20 and easily won the playoffs. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=640.8399999999999s)]
*  And now are we sure we should be marginalizing Tatum like this? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=644.36s)]
*  Well, what's your goal? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=647.8s)]
*  I mean, cause they just have Tatum on the side. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=649.52s)]
*  We're not giving LeBron's minutes to Tatum in the 2020. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=651.88s)]
*  They made this decision. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=655.4399999999999s)]
*  They'd made the decision to give the car case to LeBron and I'm not sure [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=656.88s)]
*  Tatum is a stand on the side guy. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=661.4399999999999s)]
*  Cause he's not a good three point shooter. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=663.24s)]
*  So Katie, I think he's going to get those minutes. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=664.8399999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=667.28s)]
*  Katie who, if he's healthy, healthy. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=668.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=672.4799999999999s)]
*  It's cause the other one talked ourselves into this. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=673.3599999999999s)]
*  I love this. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=675.4s)]
*  Well, the other one who is not used to not having the ball is Edwards. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=676.3599999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=680.4s)]
*  You've you've guys are just like, I'm just not used to standing over here. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=680.8s)]
*  Hoping I get the ball. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=684.4s)]
*  That's not how I don't really, you watch when Derek White was out there. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=685.52s)]
*  Derek White and Drew are so good at not having the ball and Derek [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=688.8s)]
*  White's like cutting, right? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=693.56s)]
*  The defense is falling asleep. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=695.68s)]
*  All of a sudden he's doing back cuts and it's like, yeah, that's what you do. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=696.88s)]
*  When you have the ball, I don't fully know if some of these guys know how to do that. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=699.28s)]
*  So it was a lot of like LeBron just pounding the ball and people just kind of [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=703.92s)]
*  standing there waiting to see what he was going to do. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=707.7199999999999s)]
*  And then there's the deferential piece. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=709.4799999999999s)]
*  Cause it's one of the greatest parts of all time. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=710.9599999999999s)]
*  So I can be like, Hey LeBron, let me take this one. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=713.5999999999999s)]
*  Um, the good stuff was the LeBron Curry stuff. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=716.0s)]
*  I thought was really promising. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=718.8s)]
*  The, uh, the using LeBron as like the greatest dream on ever. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=721.24s)]
*  There was some LeBron Curry and bead triangle stuff that I was like, Whoa, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=725.56s)]
*  what's that? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=731.0799999999999s)]
*  There's times when it beads just like, I'm just going to plant my ass down. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=731.72s)]
*  Just get me the ball. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=735.36s)]
*  It's a four footer. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=736.1999999999999s)]
*  So it might, it might be fine. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=738.0s)]
*  I guess is my point. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=740.68s)]
*  It should be fine. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=741.52s)]
*  Of course we have the best players from, from top to bottom. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=742.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=747.48s)]
*  But you and I have known each other a long time. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=747.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=750.72s)]
*  You can't just put a team of your 12 best dudes out there. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=751.6s)]
*  They have to compliment each other in some way. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=754.3199999999999s)]
*  And I'm not a hundred percent confident they achieved that with [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=756.6s)]
*  this group they put together. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=760.24s)]
*  There's versions of it. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=761.88s)]
*  There's five man versions, but ultimately like, I don't know. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=762.88s)]
*  Well, the one thing I do know is it time to start talking some of these props? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=769.84s)]
*  Because the thing that leaps off the page based on the entirety of our last. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=773.8s)]
*  We did not discuss this. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=778.72s)]
*  I think we have the same one. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=780.08s)]
*  What is it? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=781.2800000000001s)]
*  Comparing notes is LeBron James to be the top U S assist leader at plus 142. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=782.2800000000001s)]
*  That's, that's probably my favorite bet. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=789.48s)]
*  Um, on the entire board is the Bron to lead the U S team in assists at plus money. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=792.5200000000001s)]
*  That was my second favorite bet. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=799.12s)]
*  I thought the odds I blinked cause I was like, why is that minus 142? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=801.24s)]
*  Like he's going to have the ball all the time. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=806.24s)]
*  And there's clearly they want him to be the star of the Olympics. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=808.88s)]
*  And I think everybody's either signed up for that or maybe. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=812.1600000000001s)]
*  It's begrudgingly signed up for it, depending on the player. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=816.32s)]
*  Um, I liked that one. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=819.2800000000001s)]
*  I love, that was my second favorite. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=821.12s)]
*  My favorite was Anthony Davis. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=823.96s)]
*  Most rebounds on team USA minus one 10. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=825.9200000000001s)]
*  I was shocked. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=828.9200000000001s)]
*  I think he's going to win that comfortably. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=830.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's right here. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=832.64s)]
*  See the other thing with the bead, like, right. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=834.0s)]
*  Well, the other thing with Embiid, are we sure Embiid's going to be [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=837.52s)]
*  able to play in every game? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=839.96s)]
*  Uh, all we've done is watch Joel Embiid when it becomes like, you know, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=841.72s)]
*  playoff time, important game time, not be able to play. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=846.32s)]
*  And by the way, he's still not in shape. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=850.44s)]
*  And by the way, congrats to Philly for having, you know, a forced kind of [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=852.88s)]
*  training camp to put the dude through some kind of discipline in the summer. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=858.64s)]
*  Uh, post his, his, his [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=863.32s)]
*  Philly is the big winner. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=864.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=866.04s)]
*  He's actually like exercising. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=866.32s)]
*  It's a hundred percent right. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=868.0s)]
*  He's, he doesn't want to be embarrassed. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=869.5200000000001s)]
*  I mean, the most important thing I'll knock on wood. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=871.84s)]
*  I mean, obviously, uh, we're slightly disparaging Joel, but, uh, I want him [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=873.8000000000001s)]
*  to be healthy for this upcoming NBA season. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=879.1600000000001s)]
*  Slightly. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=880.8000000000001s)]
*  He's out of shape. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=881.08s)]
*  As usual. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=882.96s)]
*  Just watch him on, watch him on TV. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=883.6400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=886.4000000000001s)]
*  He's the luxury item of this team that I'm both not sure they need, but then on [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=886.6s)]
*  the flip side, I think they really need him because they do. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=893.0400000000001s)]
*  Like guess what? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=895.76s)]
*  When they play France, you know, it's going to be nice to have Joel. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=896.6s)]
*  And when they play Yoke Hitch, guess what? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=898.88s)]
*  He's going to be really fired up to go against Yoke Hitch for whatever. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=902.6s)]
*  But yeah, to me, I mean, this is such a good moment for Anthony Davis. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=906.3199999999999s)]
*  So here's, this is why I think the odds aren't better for most [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=910.4s)]
*  total rebounds on team USA. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=913.84s)]
*  Cause it's Anthony Davis. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=917.3199999999999s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=919.96s)]
*  Well, he could at any point just be rolling on the ground holding something. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=921.12s)]
*  Don't know. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=925.28s)]
*  I'm just saying like this is not, he's not Cal Ripken Jr. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=925.76s)]
*  I think that's why, cause he clearly should be a heavy favorite for most [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=931.44s)]
*  rebounds, but you have to factor in the very good in terms of playing the last [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=934.48s)]
*  two seasons, who did you like for most points? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=938.72s)]
*  Cause I'll read the odds. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=942.52s)]
*  It's LeBron's plus three 20. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=943.88s)]
*  Curry is plus three 40. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=946.24s)]
*  Edwards plus four 40. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=948.68s)]
*  That's not happening. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=950.64s)]
*  And B plus six 50. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=951.84s)]
*  It's conceivable. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=953.48s)]
*  Even if he's playing 20 minutes a game, I could see him averaging 19 [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=954.6800000000001s)]
*  points a game in 20 minutes. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=958.4s)]
*  Durant plus seven 90. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=960.12s)]
*  I don't see it with the calf Davis plus seven 90 and then Tatum 13 to one, which [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=961.52s)]
*  I really would have liked three weeks ago in that Wade, um, mellow off the [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=966.44s)]
*  bench, instant offense, lots of threes, but, um, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=973.04s)]
*  so there was an early wave of props that came out a couple of weeks ago before, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=977.84s)]
*  no Fandool, God bless them. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=981.92s)]
*  They really gave us something. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=983.4s)]
*  I mean, I spent nearly, uh, I don't want to say how many hours, but quite a bit [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=984.68s)]
*  of this morning down this Olympics basketball hole on the site and doing the [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=989.76s)]
*  evaluation is just a glorious thing. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=994.68s)]
*  But, um, Steph Curry was the leading contender for me a couple of weeks ago [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=997.16s)]
*  before we started seeing some of these friendlies because, um, I think [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1003.04s)]
*  that's because I liked the idea of Steph in his very first Olympics. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1006.44s)]
*  It's going to be his first and his last. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1011.2s)]
*  I mean, you know, maybe he'll play in the next one. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1012.6400000000001s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1014.4000000000001s)]
*  Um, right. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1015.4000000000001s)]
*  Coming out with Steve Kerr as the coach coming out of being that [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1016.6s)]
*  score and being on the world stage. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1019.32s)]
*  The problem is LeBron, this is the going away president for LeBron. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1022.12s)]
*  This tournament is about LeBron James. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1025.8400000000001s)]
*  There is no question about that now. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1027.6000000000001s)]
*  Uh, and so the odds for, for Curry have been wiped out and I don't like Curry [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1030.16s)]
*  anymore. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1035.24s)]
*  I mean, you know, LeBron seems like a reasonable enough kind of bet. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1035.8s)]
*  I'm surprised you dismissed Edwards so quickly. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1040.28s)]
*  So here's the thing with Edwards for me. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1043.32s)]
*  He, speaking of fearless is not going to feel like he needs to defer. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1045.6s)]
*  He's not going to feel like he needs to share the ball. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1050.76s)]
*  He is going to try and go to the hole when it, when it's crunch time. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1053.36s)]
*  He had double digits in all five of the friendlies. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1057.28s)]
*  Uh, he had double digits and, and, you know, not even Steph Curry had double [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1061.16s)]
*  digits in all of those games. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1064.92s)]
*  So Edwards had plus four 40 at that price is kind of attractive to me. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1066.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1071.44s)]
*  I just wonder, is he going to split minutes with Booker and is there going to [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1071.68s)]
*  be some Derek white moments where they actually just kind of need Derek white [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1076.3200000000002s)]
*  out there with Drew or Derek white separately than drew or they, that would be [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1079.76s)]
*  my fear. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1084.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1085.28s)]
*  I was looking back at in 2008, Dwyane Wade led the team in scoring in 2008, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1085.48s)]
*  which is probably the most similar team to this team. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1090.4s)]
*  Cause that team was pretty deep. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1092.48s)]
*  16 points a game led the team in scoring. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1093.6s)]
*  Sure. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1096.3999999999999s)]
*  It's not going to be very many points. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1097.12s)]
*  In 2012, Durant led the team at 19.5. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1098.9599999999998s)]
*  And then in 2016, Durant again at 19.4, but he's playing, you know, big [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1105.9599999999998s)]
*  minutes in both of those years. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1113.1999999999998s)]
*  So then you get to 2021. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1115.56s)]
*  I think Tatum led the team that, Oh, is Durant again, 20.7. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1118.56s)]
*  Man, Durant, one of the great international, I mean, it's really like, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1121.9599999999998s)]
*  it should be in the first paragraph of his legacy. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1125.0s)]
*  So there's a Durant spot, a shooter who could make those short threes plan, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1127.56s)]
*  you know, maybe 20 to 24 minutes a game. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1135.8799999999999s)]
*  So that could be Edwards, but he would have to hit the threes. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1138.6799999999998s)]
*  It's what I think it's Edwards. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1141.48s)]
*  It's a shorter three point line and you know, he can get the stroke going. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1142.6799999999998s)]
*  I don't love the odds for any of those. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1146.9199999999998s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1148.6799999999998s)]
*  We don't have to bet on that one. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1149.4s)]
*  At gunpoint, I would say Curry plus 340 because I think he's going to play a lot [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1151.0400000000002s)]
*  of minutes and if, especially if LeBron is point forward, you know, more of a [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1156.72s)]
*  facilitator and less of a drive to the basket guy, I'm with you, LeBron plus [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1162.48s)]
*  142 for assist is an amazing bet. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1166.68s)]
*  We love it. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1170.8000000000002s)]
*  Sign me up. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1171.3200000000002s)]
*  And then wasn't there, uh, wasn't there, Oh, I think it was, I think it was [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1173.52s)]
*  a, Oh, Olympics basketball MVP is a bet. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1179.16s)]
*  I don't remember them giving this out before. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1184.0400000000002s)]
*  Do you? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1187.16s)]
*  I feel like we would have argued about this. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1189.6000000000001s)]
*  This might be a new award. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1191.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1192.3200000000002s)]
*  We can look it up. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1192.8000000000002s)]
*  Well, LeBron is the favorite of plus three 20 Curry's plus six 80 Edwards is [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1193.92s)]
*  eight to one Davis at nine to one caught my attention, especially if Embiid has [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1198.76s)]
*  missed a game or two with some neat thing. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1205.52s)]
*  And Davis is suddenly playing 30 a game, putting up like 15 and 11 every game. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1207.4s)]
*  He, uh, you, you beat me to it. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1212.28s)]
*  He would have to average a double double. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1213.88s)]
*  And he, I mean, think about what he'd have to do to jump over LeBron for that. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1215.76s)]
*  LeBron plus three 20 is fine. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1219.16s)]
*  Like those, I think those are like my homes. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1221.3600000000001s)]
*  Those are like my homes and a felon VP odds. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1223.52s)]
*  Just like, yeah, not, not great value, but they're clearly gearing the team [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1225.8s)]
*  around him, so it's the safest bet. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1229.68s)]
*  Then you go to the other countries. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1231.88s)]
*  Shea is 13 to one. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1234.3600000000001s)]
*  Yoke is just 14 to one. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1236.4s)]
*  When be 15 to one. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1238.0s)]
*  What a story that would be. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1240.72s)]
*  And then, uh, Schroeder at 30 to one. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1242.96s)]
*  I thought it was interesting. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1245.8000000000002s)]
*  That would mean, so you bet on Germany, 28 to one to win the thing. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1248.0400000000002s)]
*  Or you bet on Schroeder 30 to one. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1252.2s)]
*  I'd rather just have the Germany 28 to one bet. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1253.72s)]
*  Yonis is 35 to one. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1257.16s)]
*  There's really not a lot of MVP by, you know, it's really happening house. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1259.2s)]
*  They've just ruined our future bets. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1262.96s)]
*  They just remove all the value from all of them. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1264.6000000000001s)]
*  Really the only way you can win on a future anymore in a real way is if you bet [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1267.52s)]
*  like the Patriots to win the AFC East at 50 to one and they actually do it. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1271.24s)]
*  Other than that, they remove all the value. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1275.88s)]
*  Like even the box. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1278.44s)]
*  So I think are really kind of the stealth contender for the NBA. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1279.3200000000002s)]
*  I'm talking about the Milwaukee bucks. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1285.56s)]
*  They're 15 to one. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1287.3600000000001s)]
*  They're not even good odds. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1288.48s)]
*  They're not even good. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1290.16s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1290.68s)]
*  They're not good odds and they're not good. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1292.1200000000001s)]
*  So there you go. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1293.8400000000001s)]
*  It's a stay away. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1295.4s)]
*  It makes it easy. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1296.24s)]
*  Your favorite under was the under for the Celtics for the season, right? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1298.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, I mentioned it on Monday's East coast bias with Raheem and JJ, just [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1302.64s)]
*  because 58 wins is very, very likely. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1308.6000000000001s)]
*  I know, but 58 wins the East, right? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1313.76s)]
*  Kind of going like 58. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1316.1200000000001s)]
*  Better conference. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1317.28s)]
*  It's still a great season and it's respectful. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1317.76s)]
*  And it and it and it's reflective of how committed they are to the regular season. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1320.72s)]
*  It's just they don't have a poor Zingis. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1325.0800000000002s)]
*  I agree with you that at least till the All-Star break. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1329.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1331.8s)]
*  February. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1332.16s)]
*  And you know, it's just that fatigue. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1333.3600000000001s)]
*  Like it doesn't make sense. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1335.96s)]
*  They don't have to go full pedal to the metal. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1337.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1340.0800000000002s)]
*  The first part of the season, they're going to win their share of games. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1340.44s)]
*  I mean, they're, you know, 58 wins translates into whatever the win [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1344.04s)]
*  percentages is still very high. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1346.96s)]
*  Um, I just felt like 58 and a half. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1349.56s)]
*  You don't need to, they don't need to win 60 games. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1352.2s)]
*  And I don't think they're going to. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1354.52s)]
*  I don't think anyone wins 60 games in the East. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1356.36s)]
*  No argument. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1359.76s)]
*  No argument. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1360.52s)]
*  I think if we get a 60 win team, it comes out of the West and it could be a team [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1361.08s)]
*  like, okay, see like they, I could see them being six, seven wins better just [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1365.56s)]
*  because they got deeper and better. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1370.32s)]
*  And they're guys are a year older. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1371.6399999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1373.56s)]
*  So our recommendations USA minus seven 50. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1373.76s)]
*  We don't like the odds. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1377.08s)]
*  France 15 to one Germany, 28 to one as long shot beds. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1380.32s)]
*  Pretty good odds. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1384.72s)]
*  Just a little bit, just a little like a sprinkle. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1385.6s)]
*  You can still feel patriotic and root for USA. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1388.32s)]
*  And then we both love LeBron for best assists at plus one 42. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1391.52s)]
*  That's right. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1396.2s)]
*  Now let me, we'll, we'll, we'll part, uh, jock Landale catch your attention [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1397.04s)]
*  at all for Australia, top rebounder for Australia, jock Landale at plus one 28. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1401.76s)]
*  They have no other size. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1408.96s)]
*  They have to op reef. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1410.16s)]
*  I believe that's how you pronounce his name. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1411.56s)]
*  I didn't realize that was something you could bet on. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1413.68s)]
*  I didn't get to the unfando. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1415.56s)]
*  I didn't get to the jack Landale section. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1417.2s)]
*  You didn't go all the way down to Australia. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1419.24s)]
*  I obviously didn't go all the way down, but I didn't realize [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1421.04s)]
*  getting is available at minus two 90 to lead Australia in assists. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1424.08s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1428.6s)]
*  You just have to lay the juice. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1429.24s)]
*  It's like, that doesn't feel like a bad bet. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1430.4s)]
*  Um, but jock Landale available plus one 28 plus money for land [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1433.08s)]
*  Landale to lead in rebounds. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1437.48s)]
*  That's my other favorite bet, uh, on, on the board. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1440.68s)]
*  Uh, that's really good. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1445.32s)]
*  Most points for them. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1446.6s)]
*  Giddies plus one 84. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1448.48s)]
*  I thought I saw one of the Australia games and I thought [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1449.96s)]
*  giddy, you could just see it that she's going to be good in Chicago. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1453.28s)]
*  I, I'm, I feel pretty confident. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1456.52s)]
*  Perfect situation for him. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1458.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1459.72s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1460.12s)]
*  He needs a ball at the time, which puts, puts something in [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1460.52s)]
*  common with him and half the guys on team USA. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1463.36s)]
*  We'll see how it goes. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1465.96s)]
*  I I'm sure there's going to be some drama. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1467.0s)]
*  There's going to be a game in the first four where they look like [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1468.84s)]
*  shit and they're losing at halftime. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1471.76s)]
*  Um, I still think they're going to win. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1474.2s)]
*  And I think the Lebron MVP bet is the, is the smart thing too, because. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1476.36s)]
*  You know, he's going to bring the flag out at the beginning of the Olympics. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1480.76s)]
*  Like, it just feels like this is the Lebron thing. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1483.4s)]
*  It's an interesting spot for Curry, by the way. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1486.0s)]
*  Cause I think Curry was like, I thought this was going to be my Olympics. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1489.3600000000001s)]
*  I've never met an Olympic team. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1493.24s)]
*  I agree. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1495.0400000000002s)]
*  What happened to the Steph Curry Olympics? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1495.96s)]
*  This is going to be the Lebron going away present this whole year. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1497.96s)]
*  He gets Bronnie. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1501.3200000000002s)]
*  I mean, I, you know, would surprise you if he plays this year, gets all [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1502.8000000000002s)]
*  this stuff with Bronnie and then retires at the end of the season. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1505.3600000000001s)]
*  He gets Zach Levine. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1507.96s)]
*  But that's the Celtic hater in you. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1512.2800000000002s)]
*  Just, just try to talk some shit into existence. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1514.0s)]
*  I don't know what moves they're, what moves are available for them. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1516.6s)]
*  They haven't made a move. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1520.6399999999999s)]
*  They haven't even set free agents. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1521.52s)]
*  That's great. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1523.28s)]

*  What do you want to say? [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1525.84s)]
*  The Lakers are a play-in team. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1526.6s)]
*  You think they're even a play-in team? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDrEh_osOm0&t=1528.0s)]
