# Jimmy Butler Might Get Traded? | Bill Opens An NBA 6-Pack | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [December 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc)
*  Brought to you by Miklo Bultra, the official beer sponsor of the NBA, my favorite league, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=0.0s)]
*  the NBA Cup. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=7.32s)]
*  Not only is it underway, the semifinals are this weekend in Vegas. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=8.32s)]
*  Miklo Bultra Courtside ready to get fans closer to the action. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=11.76s)]
*  Sign up for Miklo Bultra for a chance to win Courtside seats, a trip to the Paris global [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=15.0s)]
*  game. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=20.36s)]
*  That sounds fun. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=21.36s)]
*  A trip to All-Star Weekend and other prizes. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=22.36s)]
*  the game than ever before. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=25.44s)]
*  I'm going to open a six pack. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=31.0s)]
*  Six things I've noticed, six things I want to talk about. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=32.38s)]
*  We hit a little bit with Jacoby and Goldsberry on Tuesday night's podcast. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=35.400000000000006s)]
*  Specifically, we talked about Jimmy Butler and Golden State and how from a Golden State [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=40.0s)]
*  standpoint you saw it last night too. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  I think they have a two to three year window here with Curry and Draymond to compete for [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=47.28s)]
*  a title. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  Whether they're going to win a title remains to be seen. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  They need one more offensive player, somebody who can take the burden. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=54.2s)]
*  You saw in the game last night, they're up six with two and a half minutes left and just [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=59.0s)]
*  some of the worst possessions you could possibly have. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=63.1s)]
*  They become very easy to stop at the end of the game. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=65.64s)]
*  Jimmy Butler is somebody that makes sense for them and fits in with him, Draymond and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=67.8s)]
*  some role players. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=73.08s)]
*  You can see it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=74.08s)]
*  It's not nothing. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=75.08s)]
*  He makes $48.8 million this year and he's a player option. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=76.08s)]
*  The player option is key because everybody thinks that he's either going to opt out at [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=79.02000000000001s)]
*  the end of the year and become a free agent or he'll want to do an extension with Miami, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=83.0s)]
*  which Miami Clear doesn't want to do because they've had a year and a half to do it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  OK, so we talked about some of the apron stuff on Tuesday and how hard it is to make trades [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=92.11999999999999s)]
*  in the NBA right now. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=97.0s)]
*  And I was saying how on the one hand, I kind of like it because it's a little more like [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=98.32s)]
*  the NFL guys are kind of stuck in their situations. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=101.56s)]
*  You can't just decide you're unhappy in a month and be, I want to go somewhere else. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=104.24s)]
*  You look at Brandon Ingram, you look at Zach Levine. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=108.11999999999999s)]
*  These are guys that are actually, well, Ingram just got hurt, but guys that were playing [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=111.04s)]
*  pretty well in situations that they weren't happy with because they didn't really have [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  any other choice. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=117.08000000000001s)]
*  And that could be how it plays out with Jimmy Butler. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=118.92s)]
*  On the other hand, we've already seen that he can get a little frisky if he's not happy. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=122.28s)]
*  I think Miami is feeling that pressure too. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=127.12s)]
*  And if you're Miami, where are you going? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=128.76s)]
*  You're light years away from the Boston OKC Cleveland group. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=131.28s)]
*  You're not even really a second tier contender. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=134.88s)]
*  You're probably a second and a half tier contender. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  And maybe you could use Butler's contract. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=139.88s)]
*  You could put Roger with it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=142.44s)]
*  You could try to create a new world for yourself where you're basically just paying hero and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=144.0s)]
*  bam and Duncan Robinson's last year, next year and some other things. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=147.68s)]
*  And you're under 110 million heading into free agency this summer with a lot of options. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=151.56s)]
*  You might just want to blow it up and redo it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=156.8s)]
*  The problem is this apron stuff. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=159.28s)]
*  And for Miami, it's not that bad because they are not hard capped. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=161.48s)]
*  They're over the first apron. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=165.76s)]
*  They're under the second apron, not hard capped. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=167.96s)]
*  Which means you can actually make four for twos, three for twos, four for threes, all [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=169.8s)]
*  those kind of trades. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=173.48000000000002s)]
*  But some of the teams that they would be trading with, it's just not realistic with the apron. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  Like, Shams reported he had Dallas and Phoenix and some teams that I just don't think there's [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=180.32000000000002s)]
*  any way, shape or form that there's a trade to be had with either side because of the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=185.28s)]
*  apron stuff and because of the lack of assets. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  But that did lead to Jimmy's agent, Bernie Lee, getting really mad at Shams, which I [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  loved. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=196.24s)]
*  He's one of my the only agents that actually like anyway, Golden State. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=197.32000000000002s)]
*  So Golden State is hard capped at the first apron. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=201.56s)]
*  I swear there's not going to be a test after this. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=203.84s)]
*  And 1.7 million under the second apron, which is key because that means they can make three [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=205.96s)]
*  for ones, four for twos, stuff like that, as long as they don't pop over the second [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  apron. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  This is so much math. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  Here's the trade. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  It would be Wiggins and Kaminga and Melton, who's out for the year. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=220.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  So that's 46.6 million. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  And Jimmy's making 48.8 million. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=226.96s)]
*  Well, that doesn't work for Golden State. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=228.88s)]
*  They also only have 14 guys. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=231.32000000000002s)]
*  So if they do a four for one, they would have to then sign more guys to get to 14 because [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  that's the rule. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=238.72s)]
*  Well, that doesn't work either. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=239.72s)]
*  So I don't really know how it works with Golden State unless they dump one of their guys, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=241.96s)]
*  Kyle Anderson, Gary Payton, Moses Moody, who they just signed to an extension. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  They'd have to dump somebody to a third team. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=254.36s)]
*  And I always get suspicious when that becomes in play. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=256.72s)]
*  This is why Houston just seems like such the logical team to me. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=261.6s)]
*  And I know they're on a high right now. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=265.0s)]
*  They just made the NBA Cup semifinals with some help from Bill Kennedy. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=266.24s)]
*  Great call. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=271.7s)]
*  Always want to call that loose ball foul. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=272.7s)]
*  When guys dive on each other, which never gets called ever, you definitely want to decide [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  a game that way. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=278.16s)]
*  Great job by him. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=279.16s)]
*  The problem for Houston right now is the end of the game stuff. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=281.28s)]
*  And you saw it yesterday. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=284.44s)]
*  As I've said before, they're probably my favorite league pass team, but the end of the game [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=286.03999999999996s)]
*  stuff is where it gets a little dodgy with them. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=289.44s)]
*  And a lot of that has to do with Fred Van Vliet, who just has not been that good this [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=293.52s)]
*  year. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=297.32s)]
*  16 points a game, all shooting stats are down. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=298.32s)]
*  And he's also a team option for next year at 42.9 million. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=300.52s)]
*  So you could actually use Van Vliet as part of a mega trade, right? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=303.76s)]
*  So they have Steven Adams at 12.6. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=307.4s)]
*  They have Green and Tate at 8.7 and a half that are expiring. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=309.4s)]
*  They have a lot of options too. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=314.47999999999996s)]
*  They also have a ton of picks. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=315.76s)]
*  They have a couple of Brooklyn picks, a couple of Phoenix picks. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=316.91999999999996s)]
*  They own some of their own firsts. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=319.79999999999995s)]
*  So they have a lot of flexibility and maneuverability. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=320.79999999999995s)]
*  And the trade that I created, being the Picasso of the trade machine, if it's Van Vliet and [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=324.35999999999996s)]
*  it's Adams is expiring and Tate's expiring and Cam Whitmore, who I actually like, who's [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=330.12s)]
*  just buried because he's got the terror twins in front of him, Shailen Green. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=334.56s)]
*  And you get Butler and Roger back and you put a pick in that trade and Miami is saving [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=338.8s)]
*  seven million just on that deal. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=344.84000000000003s)]
*  Plus they get a pick. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=346.88s)]
*  They get to look at Whitmore. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=347.88s)]
*  They get Van Vliet. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=349.36s)]
*  They get to kind of stay peripherally competitive this year. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=350.36s)]
*  They could still move Van Vliet in a one for one trade if they wanted to, if it was a salary [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=353.32s)]
*  close. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=358.08000000000004s)]
*  That trade makes sense to me for both sides because it allows Miami to reboot. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=359.08000000000004s)]
*  It allows Houston to end up with Butler, Brooks, Shangoon, Green, Roger, Jabari, the terror [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=364.0s)]
*  twins and Landell. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=370.68s)]
*  And I already had them third or fourth in the West anyway. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=373.0s)]
*  And I like Van Vliet. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=375.64s)]
*  Oh, I forgot Shepherd too. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=377.36s)]
*  I like Van Vliet, but I think they could get by with Adam and you put Butler and Butler [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=378.72s)]
*  now becomes the end of the game guy. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=383.6s)]
*  I think you'd have a chip on his shoulder. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=385.04s)]
*  That's the trade I'm rooting for. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=387.16s)]
*  I just think that's a fun trade for everybody. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=388.32s)]
*  It would be yet another Miami situation where they're doing a reboot and it seems like it's [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=391.15999999999997s)]
*  bleak and they're done. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=396.23999999999995s)]
*  And then all of a sudden they're a 55 win team again because they make two moves. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=397.23999999999995s)]
*  Anyway, that is number one leading to number two. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=401.0s)]
*  What the hell does Golden State do if they can't get Jimmy Butler? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=405.0s)]
*  Because I don't, I think it's really hard to pull off. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=407.44s)]
*  You're going to have to trade a pick in a Jimmy Butler trade. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=410.71999999999997s)]
*  You have to trade another pick to get rid of the contract you need to make it happen [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=413.47999999999996s)]
*  or put Pud Zemsky. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=418.08s)]
*  You have to put him somewhere else to create the thing. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=420.04s)]
*  Like, is it worth it to trade Wiggins and Kaminga and Melton and a pick and then send [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=423.04s)]
*  Pud Zemsky somewhere else to get another asset to get Jimmy Butler? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=428.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't think it is. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=432.0s)]
*  My advice for them, the Brooklyn Nets are in a bizarre situation right now where they're [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=433.72s)]
*  playing really well and they're overachieving because Jordy Fernandez has been a revelation [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=439.16s)]
*  as a coach. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=445.08000000000004s)]
*  It really reminds me of Will Hardy that first year in Utah, Brad Stevens, his first year [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=446.08000000000004s)]
*  in Boston. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=449.68s)]
*  We see this happen from time to time where the coach is just too good for the tank. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=451.12s)]
*  So Brooklyn's going to have to start sabotaging their own team and they have Cam Johnson, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=455.24s)]
*  who's having the best year of his career. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=459.48s)]
*  He's 19 a game, 45% three. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=460.8s)]
*  I test looks the best he's been. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=462.84000000000003s)]
*  28 years old, he's a little older than I think you think he is. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=465.16s)]
*  But if I was going to stay out of Audible and go after Cam Johnson and Schreuger and [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=469.32s)]
*  something we can do with Wiggins. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=477.04s)]
*  Do we want to put Kaminga in that? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=478.92s)]
*  If we don't want to pay Kaminga next year, could you turn Kaminga into Cam Johnson basically? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=481.68s)]
*  Could it be Kaminga and Melton for Cam Johnson? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=487.0s)]
*  Is there some version of would you rather pay Cam Johnson 22 million than Kaminga for [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=489.64000000000004s)]
*  30? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=494.12s)]
*  Do you try to get Schreuder in it? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=495.12s)]
*  Could it be Wiggins, Melton and an unprotected first for Johnson and Schreuder? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=497.22s)]
*  Does Kaminga even need that bit? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=501.48s)]
*  It just feels like Brooklyn Golden State seems to match up. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=503.04s)]
*  So keep an eye on that. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=506.56s)]
*  I don't think Golden State is going to be able to get a second star. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=508.28000000000003s)]
*  I don't see a scenario where they get LeBron and Bronny back. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=510.52000000000004s)]
*  LeBron and Bronny making 50 million combined. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=513.5600000000001s)]
*  They'd have all the same problems that they would have trying to get Jimmy Butler that [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=516.28s)]
*  I just laid out. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=519.44s)]
*  On top of the fact that LeBron is at his 22nd season and doesn't play defense anymore. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=520.44s)]
*  So Brooklyn seems like the spot for them. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=524.64s)]
*  I'm still bullish on this Golden State team, but Curry needs some help. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=527.2s)]
*  Next thing. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=530.84s)]
*  So the Wilt 50 Club, which I just created one second ago, where you have to play 50 [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=533.8s)]
*  games and you have to average 50 points, rebounds and assists combined at least. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=540.1999999999999s)]
*  And it is not as easy as you think, my friends. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=547.24s)]
*  Just since the merger, Kareem did it three times. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=550.3599999999999s)]
*  Highest was 56 in 1971. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=554.16s)]
*  Luca did it last year, 52.9. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=556.52s)]
*  Russ did it in his MVP season, 52.7. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=558.76s)]
*  Bob McAdoo? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=562.0s)]
*  50.8 in 1975. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=563.0s)]
*  Giannis is doing it right now, 50.1. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=565.2s)]
*  Harden did it in 2019, 50.3. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=567.84s)]
*  And Jokic? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=571.96s)]
*  56.1 right now, which would be the single highest number anyone has done since Wilt [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=572.96s)]
*  and Russ were playing. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=581.04s)]
*  So the reason it's the Wilt 50 Club. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=582.04s)]
*  Wilt has the top six. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=584.16s)]
*  Wilt has 10 in the top 11. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=586.04s)]
*  Wilt averaged a 78.4 points, rebounds, assists combined in 1962. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=588.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=592.68s)]
*  Oscar Robertson did it five times. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=593.68s)]
*  Pettit did it twice. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=595.8399999999999s)]
*  Eldren did it twice. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=596.8399999999999s)]
*  Walt Bellamy did it once. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=597.8399999999999s)]
*  We don't count Walt Bellamy. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=599.4399999999999s)]
*  Jordan's highest ever, 48.9. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=601.4399999999999s)]
*  Shaq's highest ever, 47.1. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=603.4s)]
*  Bird, 45.8. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=605.4399999999999s)]
*  LeBron, 45.6. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=606.88s)]
*  Kobe, 45.2. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=608.4399999999999s)]
*  Just getting to 50 is really hard. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=610.16s)]
*  I like the 50 Club. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=611.88s)]
*  Let's create it. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=613.52s)]
*  Jokic right now, 32, 14, and 10. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=614.52s)]
*  And he's shooting 56, 50, and 81%. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=617.4399999999999s)]
*  33.2 PER. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=620.8s)]
*  This season's just insane. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=622.8s)]
*  But I don't know how high this goes, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=624.8s)]
*  because it's too high right now. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=627.8s)]
*  It's not going to lie. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=628.8s)]
*  He's not going to be continuing to do the stuff [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=629.8s)]
*  that he's been doing. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=631.8s)]
*  It's not realistic. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=632.8s)]
*  But could he end up 31, 13, and nine? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=633.8s)]
*  Could he end up 32, 13, and 10? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=638.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=641.8s)]
*  I'm prepared for anything, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=642.8s)]
*  because nobody on the team could score. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=643.8s)]
*  So the 50 Club. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=645.8s)]
*  I think Jokic. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=649.8s)]
*  Kareem is the highest ever, 56.0. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=650.8s)]
*  I think Jokic could potentially set the record. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=653.8s)]
*  I'm in on the 50 Club. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=655.8s)]
*  All right, they wanted me to do a superior take, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=657.8s)]
*  and I have one, of course. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=659.8s)]
*  I've been thinking a lot about the fouling [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=660.8s)]
*  at the end of the game stuff, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=662.8s)]
*  because there was the Celtics Cavaliers game, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=663.8s)]
*  which has now become infamous. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=666.8s)]
*  I think it was a week and a half ago. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=668.8s)]
*  Celtics are down four with under 30 seconds left. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=670.8s)]
*  There are 18 free throw attempts in the last 26 seconds. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=673.8s)]
*  Both teams just were fouling each other. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=676.8s)]
*  Everybody was like, nobody's going to shoot a three. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=678.8s)]
*  Well, I'll foul you two, and it just becomes a foul off. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=680.8s)]
*  Final score was 115 to 111. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=683.8s)]
*  There were 20 points scored in the last 26 seconds [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=685.8s)]
*  because of all the free throws. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=688.8s)]
*  And I think I speak for everyone. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=689.8s)]
*  This sucks. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=692.8s)]
*  The free throw parade down the stretch is abominable, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=694.8s)]
*  and it feels like it's getting worse. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=698.8s)]
*  So how do we fix it? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=699.8s)]
*  Well, I have a regular season fix for this. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=701.8s)]
*  If you foul somebody in the last minute of a game, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=705.8s)]
*  no matter what the score is, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=707.8s)]
*  whether you're leading or trailing, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=708.8s)]
*  the first free throw counts for two points, and that's it. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=711.8s)]
*  And if you make it, you get basically the two points [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=715.8s)]
*  for the free throws. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=717.8s)]
*  The game keeps going. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=718.8s)]
*  If you miss it, you still get to shoot a second free throw, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=719.8s)]
*  but that only counts for one point. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=723.8s)]
*  So when we have these foul offs at the end, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=725.8s)]
*  Pritchard gets fouled by Cleveland, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=728.8s)]
*  even though they're up four. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=730.8s)]
*  If Pritchard hits one, now it's a two point game, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=731.8s)]
*  and that's how it goes. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=734.8s)]
*  And I really think it would work. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=736.8s)]
*  I don't know who would be against it. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=738.8s)]
*  And let's speed these games up, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=740.8s)]
*  because the other option is the Elam ending, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=742.8s)]
*  which nobody really understands. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=744.8s)]
*  Two points for your first free throw [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=746.8s)]
*  in the last minute of the game. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=748.8s)]
*  Let's try it in the regular season. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=750.8s)]
*  Let's see if it works, and if it works, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=752.8s)]
*  we do it for the playoffs. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=753.8s)]
*  That's my superior take. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=754.8s)]
*  All right, two more things really quick. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=756.8s)]
*  Who could be next year's out of nowhere young contender? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=759.8s)]
*  So this would be a team playing right now. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=763.8s)]
*  That a year from now, maybe it would look like [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=765.8s)]
*  the Rockets right now, as one of the best [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=769.8s)]
*  four teams in the West. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=771.8s)]
*  The Rockets were 41 and 41 last year. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=772.8s)]
*  Maybe it looks like OKC last year, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=774.8s)]
*  when they won 57 games the year before, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=777.8s)]
*  they were 40 and 42. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=779.8s)]
*  Maybe it looks like Memphis in 2022, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=780.8s)]
*  when they won 56 games the year before, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=783.8s)]
*  they were 38 and 34. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=785.8s)]
*  So a team that's around 500, maybe a little bit lower, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=787.8s)]
*  but has some pedigree, at least one young star [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=791.8s)]
*  with a chance to be really great, need to be around 500, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=794.8s)]
*  need to have some other fun pieces, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=798.8s)]
*  and there's two candidates, one for each conference. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=800.8s)]
*  The Pistons, this is a team Rosillo has been very focused on. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=804.8s)]
*  I always admire Rosillo's love for weirdly compelling [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=807.8s)]
*  East Coast teams. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=811.8s)]
*  Detroit's 10 for 15. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=812.8s)]
*  Played a pretty hard schedule. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=815.8s)]
*  They lost to Boston twice, lost to Milwaukee twice, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=816.8s)]
*  lost to Cleveland, lost to Houston, lost to Memphis, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=819.8s)]
*  lost to Orlando, split with the Knicks, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=821.8s)]
*  and they've been hanging around a lot of these games, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=824.8s)]
*  and Rosillo's made this point in his pod, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=826.8s)]
*  but these early afternoon, like four o'clock games, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=828.8s)]
*  you're usually stuck with like whatever the 7 p.m. Eastern. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=833.8s)]
*  So I've actually watched some Detroit [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=835.8s)]
*  and I've watched some Charlotte, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=837.8s)]
*  and I like what Detroit has going. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=838.8s)]
*  They're not Monty Williams as a coach, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=840.8s)]
*  which is the number one thing, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=842.8s)]
*  but Cade's 24 points a game, seven rebounds, nine assists. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=843.8s)]
*  He has hit every sort of ceiling [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=848.8s)]
*  you would have thought he was gonna hit at this point. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=850.8s)]
*  Shoot almost 40% from three. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=852.8s)]
*  Like he's just really good. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=854.8s)]
*  He's somebody that you could build a team around. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=855.8s)]
*  Beasley and Harris were two pretty smart free agent signings. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=858.8s)]
*  They're averaging 30 a game and shooting 40% from three. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=862.8s)]
*  Jade and Ivy's been good. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=865.8s)]
*  They have rebounding. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=866.8s)]
*  And I wonder like if I'm them, fuck it. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=868.8s)]
*  Do I do a trade? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=872.8s)]
*  Do I try to get Brandon Ingrams on a discount? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=873.8s)]
*  Brandon Ingram's on a discount. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=876.8s)]
*  Zach Levine's on a discount. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=877.8s)]
*  C.J. McCollum's on a discount. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=879.8s)]
*  Do I think about Jimmy Butler? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=881.8s)]
*  They don't have to worry about any of this apron stuff. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=883.8s)]
*  This could be another Cam Johnson team. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=886.8s)]
*  This is actually kind of a perfect Cam Johnson team. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=888.8s)]
*  I wonder if Detroit is gonna look at what happened [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=892.8s)]
*  with Orlando and OKC the last couple years [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=895.8s)]
*  and what's happening with Houston this year [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=897.8s)]
*  and think like, hmm, I wonder if we make one move here. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=900.8s)]
*  Could our ceiling increase, especially if Miami goes backwards? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=903.8s)]
*  Indiana's already gone backwards. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=906.8s)]
*  Could we be a top 16 potentially? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=907.8s)]
*  So I'm watching them. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=909.8s)]
*  The other team is obviously San Antonio, who's 12 and 12, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=910.8s)]
*  which is surprising because I haven't really enjoyed watching them. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=914.8s)]
*  Sohan, Castle, and Johnson shoot 27% from three combined. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=918.8s)]
*  Chris Paul better season than we expected, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=922.8s)]
*  but he's old and who knows of him. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=924.8s)]
*  But the foundation I like, they have Wembe and Castle [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=926.8s)]
*  and Harrison Barnes and Paul. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=929.8s)]
*  They have some good vets. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=931.8s)]
*  They have a couple of heat check dudes and they have a lot of picks. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=932.8s)]
*  They have a shitload of picks. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=935.8s)]
*  And I wonder, is that a Cam Johnson team? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=936.8s)]
*  Probably not a Jimmy Butler team, but could it be like a CJ McCollum team? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=939.8s)]
*  I'm watching them to see, are they just going to be happy to be a 500 team again? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=944.8s)]
*  I don't know why they would be because they're going to be too good to tank. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=951.8s)]
*  They're not going to be in the top five or top six. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=954.8s)]
*  So maybe think about going for it. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=956.8s)]
*  Which leads me to the sixth and last thing for the six pack. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=958.8s)]
*  Atlanta, a team that I really liked before the season. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=961.8s)]
*  You probably remember from the Over Under pod. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=964.8s)]
*  House and I went all in on their Over. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=966.8s)]
*  A team that I mentioned last week when House and I, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=968.8s)]
*  after Million Dollar Picks, we talked about Wembe Futures. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=971.8s)]
*  I doubled down when I was in Denver last week on FanDuel [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=973.8s)]
*  with the Atlanta Over Under stuff because it was 38 and a half. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=976.8s)]
*  Right now they're 14 and 12. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=980.8s)]
*  They upset the Knicks last night and it wasn't even really an upset. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=981.8s)]
*  I thought they kind of dominated them in the second half. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=985.8s)]
*  And I really do wonder if that was a playoff series. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=987.8s)]
*  I would be super scared if I was the Knicks because they don't really have a way to control the Tre Young dribble slash dribble penetration, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=990.8s)]
*  whatever we're calling it these days. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=999.8s)]
*  Their wings kind of match up against the Knicks wings, the Atlanta wings. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1001.8s)]
*  They have rebounding. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1004.8s)]
*  It's just, I think that's a dangerous matchup for them. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1006.8s)]
*  Their third and pace, which I like, and I wonder if they're going to be able to do that. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1008.8s)]
*  Their third and pace, which I like, and I wonder if Atlanta has a real chance to become this year's pacers. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1012.8s)]
*  The key for them, two things. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1019.8s)]
*  One is the three point shooting. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1021.8s)]
*  Daniels is only at 31 percent. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1023.8s)]
*  Riche de Chez is 28 percent. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1025.8s)]
*  Tre is 31 percent, which is bad. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1027.8s)]
*  Hunter has been overachieving. He's 45 percent. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1029.8s)]
*  But can those swings start hitting more threes? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1031.8s)]
*  Then secondly, what are we getting from Tre? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1034.8s)]
*  I think this is it. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1038.8s)]
*  I think we've hit the let's figure this out once and for all moment with Tre, almost like a political candidate for an election. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1040.8s)]
*  He's been dining off that conference finals thing for a few years now, which I think we all know happened because Embiid was super banged up. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1046.8s)]
*  There were a couple of fluky games and Ben Simmons basically had a basketball mental breakdown and just completely lost it for whatever reason. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1056.8s)]
*  Tre this year, 21 and 12, 12 assists a game solid. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1066.8s)]
*  38 percent shooting, 31 percent from three, which doesn't stop him from launching the 29 footers. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1070.8s)]
*  Free throws are down to six a game. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1076.8s)]
*  They used to be at nine. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1078.8s)]
*  Turnovers highest they've ever been, 4.6. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1080.8s)]
*  And with all of that said, this is the perfect team for him. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1082.8s)]
*  He's got swings everywhere. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1086.8s)]
*  He's got a bunch of guys to protect him on defense. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1088.8s)]
*  Daniels, whoever the other team's point guard is, you saw it with the Knicks game with Brunson. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1090.8s)]
*  Daniels can guard every team's point guard, small guard, whoever it is, Mitchell, Garland, name a guy. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1095.8s)]
*  You can put Daniels on him. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1102.8s)]
*  They're playing the Bucks. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1104.8s)]
*  He can guard Dame Lillard. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1105.8s)]
*  He can guard anybody in the league who's under 6'8". [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1106.8s)]
*  And Jalen Johnson, you know, if you're ranking the swings, Jalen Johnson, Daniels, OJN and Obi in Bridges. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1110.8s)]
*  I think I would take Jalen Johnson over the other three guys. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1119.8s)]
*  And Daniels is going to be a first team all NBA defense guy. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1122.8s)]
*  So perfect spot for Trey. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1126.8s)]
*  He's got rebounding. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1130.8s)]
*  He's got shot blocking. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1131.8s)]
*  He's got lob guys. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1132.8s)]
*  He's got tall, interchangeable shooters all over the place. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1134.8s)]
*  And I was thinking like, what would the trade be? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1138.8s)]
*  Should maybe they go get Cam Johnson? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1141.8s)]
*  I'm not even sure they need to do trade, especially now that Bogdanovich is back and they have some six man scoring stuff. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1143.8s)]
*  It really comes down to Trey Young. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1149.8s)]
*  How good is he? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1151.8s)]
*  Because he is in the perfect race car for him right now. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1152.8s)]
*  And maybe over the course of these next 20, 25 games, he's going to start figuring it out. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1156.8s)]
*  He's a guy that you saw in the next game in MSG. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc&t=1160.8s)]
