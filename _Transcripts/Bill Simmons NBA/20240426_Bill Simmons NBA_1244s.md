# Nuggets All but Finish the Lakers. Whatâ€™s Next for LeBron? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSMP7yMCJpU)
*  The Nuggets have been doing some good stuff.
*  We have not talked about the Nuggets in a while.
*  They're on this,
*  it's almost indescribable, where if they're down 20,
*  you feel like they can go back.
*  If they're down eight in the fourth quarter,
*  you feel like they're gonna win.
*  If they're up eight in the fourth quarter,
*  you feel like the game's over.
*  So they take all these different identities, right?
*  If you're comparing them to a football team,
*  they're the football team that in the fourth quarter,
*  down 10, can come back and put two touchdowns on you.
*  They're also the team that if they're up 10
*  in the football game, they can just run the ball
*  and run out the clock and you're never gonna get
*  the ball back.
*  It is unreal.
*  I said to KOC the other night,
*  I thought this is one of the three best teams
*  I've seen this century.
*  Wow.
*  Olin Lakers, 17 Warriors, and this team.
*  And then special asterisk kudos to the 2013 Heat
*  during the winning streak.
*  I think those are the four best teams.
*  They never were able to really put it together
*  during a postseason.
*  But I think those are the four best teams
*  I've seen this century.
*  Where do they rank for you?
*  Thank you for saying asterisk correctly, by the way.
*  Thank you.
*  That's one that people mess up a lot.
*  I appreciate that.
*  I had this written down in my notes.
*  I'm glad that you said this
*  because this is right in the strike zone
*  of where my brain was too.
*  Because I noticed this over listening to different shows
*  and reading different things
*  when people were talking about this team.
*  Where over and over again, you would hear people say,
*  they'd say they should be up more.
*  Like whenever that,
*  if a team gets a little bit of a lead on them,
*  like tonight, they said it on the broadcast.
*  They were like, man,
*  it feels like the Lakers should be up more.
*  Even if you hit them with a big haymaker,
*  and in the beginning of this game,
*  it was just that LA was just running.
*  It was a little deceptive
*  because they weren't really just executing Denver to death.
*  They had some good moments,
*  but they were just running a lot.
*  I think in the first half,
*  they had 13 transition looks,
*  and they scored or were fouled on.
*  All of them, they were having a lot of success with that.
*  But Denver just kind of keeps chugging along,
*  chugging along, chugging along.
*  And I feel like that's kind of the last level.
*  Like, you know, for like a team that reaches that,
*  I remember, I know this is gonna make your skin crawl,
*  but when I used to watch baseball in the early 2000s,
*  it was like, those Yankee teams were like that.
*  Where even if you had a good game against them,
*  it was just like,
*  man, but the lead's still not that big.
*  And I just feel like they have that inevitability about them
*  where they're just gonna continue to do what they do
*  and you just kind of can't shake them out of it.
*  Like, they just are gonna keep coming.
*  I have not seen anything to change my opinion
*  that they're going to win the title.
*  Kevin Wilde's my buddy who was on here last week.
*  He's been doing this gimmick on Twitter,
*  which I made fun of about where he's like,
*  nobody's beaten Nuggets in a seven game series.
*  It's actually one of the most obvious favorites we've had
*  of this century where I just don't see a scenario
*  where they lose unless somebody gets injured, basically.
*  That's it.
*  Like that.
*  And I think it would have to be one of the top four guys.
*  But you saw with the Celtics last night,
*  this is like, people thought I was trying
*  to reverse jinx the Celtics
*  or I'm just doing the glass half empty thing,
*  but I just don't think they have any chance
*  of out executing the Stemmer team.
*  You agree with KOC.
*  Did you, what KOC said about it?
*  Well, I've always felt that, well, KOC, yeah,
*  he ramped it up.
*  He threw some steroids and some HGH on the take,
*  but I just don't think they will be able
*  to out execute this Stemmer team in a seven game series.
*  I don't see it.
*  I didn't see it the whole year.
*  And you could see like in that Miami game,
*  not to shift this to the Celtics,
*  but in that Miami game, some of the strategy stuff
*  was just so head scratching, right?
*  When they fell behind, all of a sudden
*  it's one-on-one basketball.
*  You can just see things slip away
*  whereas Denver always keeps their structure, right?
*  They never get fazed.
*  They never play at a different speed.
*  They're never frantic.
*  They're always just like, we're the Nuggets.
*  We're gonna figure this out.
*  And they have one of the biggest game breakers
*  in the history of the sport.
*  To me, he's on the bird magic level at this point.
*  And now it's just about patting the resume
*  and getting the actual resume to where those guys are.
*  But I don't see much difference from impact
*  between him and those two.
*  I wanted to ask you about,
*  I wanna like his play style specifically,
*  something that really stood out to me in this game,
*  having watched them sort of on their playoff arc
*  over the past few years,
*  going back to, I felt like it kinda started to shift
*  during the bubble.
*  I remember I had prepared a whole video
*  where I was trashing their effort and stuff.
*  That was when they kept winning.
*  I was like, okay, well, that's 90 hours down the tube
*  where I had worked on that.
*  But Denver fans, it was to their benefit.
*  But as it started to shift over time,
*  I've just kinda noticed that the Nuggets
*  have taken on Nicola's personality in a way
*  where he used to be, he still has some of that.
*  It's similar to Luca where if you just kinda
*  prick the surface a little bit,
*  it'll show up every once in a while.
*  But he used to just kinda wear his heart on his sleeve
*  all the time and would just run super hot
*  and get himself out of the game.
*  You remember the crying fits he would have at the refs
*  when he'd just storm off.
*  You just don't see that as much from him.
*  I see throughout the game with them,
*  we just keep saying the same kinda things over and over again.
*  You can't speed them up, you can't get them off what they do.
*  I feel like the Nuggets have really just kinda become him
*  in a good way, whereas in the past,
*  if he pulled himself out of the game,
*  you could kinda feel them fall apart.
*  Like the physicality, stuff like that just doesn't
*  rattle them the way it used to.
*  I feel like that's sort of the evolution
*  that has made them kinda what we're talking about now
*  where they have this crazy talent,
*  but you can't get them to get off their game anymore
*  just because of that.
*  It's a good point.
*  The pace that they play, I think is so unusual.
*  And it's another thing that comes from him.
*  Because you don't think of him as this guy
*  who's like go, go, go, go, go, but he is.
*  And when he slows stuff down, it's always for a reason
*  that has to do with the game.
*  I'm gonna slow down this play because I wanna set up
*  this specific matchup and I wanna get this
*  and if we do this, then that will lead to this
*  and we'll get that.
*  But for the most part, they're always trying to push
*  because he's such a special passer
*  and his ability to just grab the ball and take off with it.
*  Like there's, I don't know how many guys
*  in the history of the league have been able to do that well
*  to be able to get a rebound in traffic
*  and then go and then create the play.
*  Was that a list of less than 10 guys?
*  Is it eight guys?
*  I don't know what the final number is,
*  but it's not a long list.
*  And then his ability to, actually, you know what?
*  I'm gonna just take this guy myself.
*  Can you guys just move over here
*  and I'm just gonna do my whirl or burl back it down thing.
*  Watching him just suck the life out of the Lakers.
*  I mean, LeBron, the body language for LeBron
*  in the second half was, because he knew.
*  Like if D-Lo's not gonna hit, this team has no chance.
*  Their really only chance was to do a little
*  like what Miami had last night,
*  which is we're just gonna make a bunch of threes
*  and try to hang with you and out shoot you basically.
*  D-Lo didn't have it.
*  They wasted two pretty good offensive games
*  from Davis and James and it just doesn't matter.
*  Those guys had 59 points combined, didn't matter.
*  Davis over in the third quarter.
*  Davis was awesome I thought throughout the game.
*  It's funny, sometimes you look at the box score
*  and you'll just be like, well, look at the draw.
*  If you look at it, Denver took 27 threes
*  and they didn't even hit 20%.
*  LA shot 22 and they shot about 13 and a half percent.
*  You're talking about Jokic, what makes him great.
*  Obviously the passing, obviously the scoring.
*  Having those two separate things in and of itself
*  is great, but I've always said that the balance of his,
*  his understanding of the balance of those two things
*  is what makes him great because if you watch him,
*  he could shoot the Philly game tonight.
*  There was a sequence where he just was like,
*  I'm shooting a no dribble three eight times in a row.
*  You were never, but the thing about Jokic is like,
*  you can't lure him into any kind of self-sabotaging agenda
*  like the way that you can some other players.
*  I'm trying to think of some of the other stars in the league.
*  I mean, Tatum is a guy, if he gets on a tough shot streak,
*  he's like, I'm taking the next one.
*  Guys who are kind of like that, Jokic will not bail you out
*  with a decision like that.
*  He has no sort of tilt this way or that.
*  He's like, I really want to score here.
*  He's just like, no, I want to play the game.
*  And like, he just, he just punishes you.
*  He just kind of like constricts like a,
*  like a Python over and over throughout the game.
*  And so you just, you know, and that's the result
*  of his decision-making.
*  He had a sequence where I think it was an offensive rebound
*  where Rui just happened to be on the same side as him.
*  And I was just like, oh boy, this is bad.
*  You could just see what was coming immediately.
*  And the last time I saw him, I was like,
*  he was a player, he was a player,
*  he was a player for like, a second and a half maybe.
*  Double comes, rifle to the opposite side, swish three.
*  It was like, that's the challenge of guarding them.
*  But just because he, he could score on anybody
*  and it doesn't matter what kind of help you send,
*  he has all the tools to exploit it
*  and the mind to exploit it.
*  Well, the irony of the Lakers,
*  like Caldwell Pope being on the other side there, right?
*  That was one of the guys that gave up
*  in the Westbrook trade.
*  And Caldwell Pope, it feels like he's gotten better
*  of three and D asset where it doesn't even really matter
*  if he scores, but he can guard anybody and just fits in.
*  He knows how to play.
*  It doesn't care if he gets the ball.
*  And then Caruso was the other guy they let go after 21,
*  where they just didn't want to pay him.
*  I think, I think they offered him three for 21
*  and Chicago offered him four for 37.
*  And the combo of those, when you watch a game like tonight
*  and you think like, you know, they want that 2020 team.
*  It's a better version of LeBron.
*  I, you know, he's just four years younger.
*  Davis, that's about as good as we've ever seen him
*  until this year.
*  But then the supporting guys were just a lot more reliable
*  because of the defense, some three point shooting,
*  some savvy Rondos on that team.
*  Dwight Howard was another big guy for them.
*  And I don't feel like the Lakers are necessarily
*  like much worse than that team,
*  but it's the subtle differences
*  where they just can't get stops.
*  And they can't survive if Reeves, I mean,
*  Ruey's been terrible for most of the series,
*  but if two of those three guys suck,
*  it's just hard for them to win.
*  They can't get enough points.
*  I don't know how they fixed this.
*  It was your mindset.
*  LeBron played 42 minutes tonight.
*  Your mind starts going, oh, where does,
*  what happens to this guy?
*  Yeah.
*  Does he stay on this team?
*  They just got swept by the Nuggets last year.
*  It looks like they're going to get swept by them this year.
*  It would be the 12th straight time if they lose game four
*  that they would have lost to Denver.
*  That's the team they need to get by.
*  They have no chance.
*  And Yoko just 27.
*  Where's he going?
*  Their whole core's young.
*  Right, yeah.
*  Yeah, and their whole core's young.
*  That team's not going anywhere.
*  They've already had their bad luck with the Murray injury.
*  And to me, this opens the door for what happens
*  with LeBron, what's important to him.
*  Is it just, I'm going to finish my career at LA.
*  It's almost done.
*  Then I'll be involved with the Vegas ownership.
*  Is it I want to go play with my son?
*  Is it I want to go be on one more really good title team?
*  And how this is played out makes it more realistic to me
*  that he wouldn't stay.
*  I'm also not positive that matters.
*  It's going to be his 22nd year.
*  And I'm not sure, can you win a title anymore
*  if he's one of your two best players?
*  I don't know.
*  I would lean toward maybe not,
*  especially with the injury potential.
*  My mind keeps going back to Karl Malone in 2004
*  when he's just, oh man, well, Karl Malone, he never gets hurt.
*  And then all of a sudden he got hurt twice
*  and he was out of the league.
*  Meet your 40s, you start getting hurt.
*  It's different animal.
*  But to me, the ass kicking nature of this series
*  in this game and then the way they were able
*  to come back in game two,
*  I know the Laker fans would be like,
*  no, no, we almost won game two.
*  It's like, yeah, but that's not the point of game two.
*  Game two is like, you had a 20 point lead
*  and it didn't feel like enough when you were up 20.
*  And I just don't know if he wants to win a fifth title.
*  I don't know how you run it back with the Lakers.
*  There's no fix.
*  It's not Trey Young, it's not Zach Levine.
*  There's no fix.
*  I don't see it.
*  Yeah, back, I mean, it's interesting to think
*  about the types of guys that worked around LeBron,
*  like in the types of like contained roles
*  that he could still win with, like having those guys play.
*  If you think about like those Miami teams,
*  with like catch and shoot guys, he had a lot of success.
*  It just seems like as he's aged.
*  That was a 10 years ago LeBron though, right?
*  That's my point, yeah.
*  He was like a Swiss army knife at that point.
*  Yeah, that's my point that like as it's gone on,
*  he's, you know, his like, you know, meter,
*  I'm doing a gesture here that doesn't really make any sense,
*  but like his meter for like I need more help
*  has gone this way and he needs guys to assert themselves
*  a little bit more, whereas like it'd be incredible
*  to have like a Kyrie in this situation
*  or somebody who could assume the assumed,
*  but these guys that he has are all sort of like distressed
*  asset, it's sort of like, you know, Reeves was an awesome
*  find, they got really fortunate there that that worked out
*  and that was a great draft, but you know,
*  Christie has been ready to play,
*  who Chaffino not ready to play.
*  Well, and not taking Hawkeyes in that draft,
*  not taking, whether it was like the ceiling of whoever,
*  but not taking a guy who could be ready to play immediately
*  and taking like a project, I guess as a trade asset.
*  That's what I thought, that's what I thought.
*  This summer, they drafted three of those guys in a row.
*  They drafted Christie, who Chaffino and then Maxwell Lewis,
*  the Pepperdine guy, and I was like, this makes no sense.
*  I was like, these guys aren't gonna be ready to go.
*  And I was like, I wonder if they're gonna like bank on
*  like these are the types of valuable players
*  we could flip for something else.
*  That's what I thought they were doing, but-
*  And then they didn't flip them.
*  Maybe the deal didn't come along
*  and they couldn't make it work,
*  but I heard Hawkeyes didn't wanna be in LA.
*  That's what I heard that he was glad.
*  Maybe he was just saying that to Miami people,
*  but I heard that he wanted to be in LA.
*  I find that hard to believe.
*  His sister goes to UCLA and like, really?
*  He's not gonna wanna play for the Lakers?
*  Who knows?
*  The Russell had a really good year for them.
*  And I think if you're just saying like,
*  oh, 17 million for a free agent guard
*  for the year he had, where he basically shot 42, 43%
*  from three for the last five months of the season, you know?
*  But deep down lurking was the Russell we were all hoping.
*  Yeah, look, this is gonna be the big topic.
*  I would be surprised if they won the Saturday game.
*  Usually, unless the league really intervened
*  and just was like, hey, anytime Yocca bows on anybody,
*  just call Fowler.
*  Scott Foster's on a plane right now, I betcha.
*  Scott Foster and his brother Bob.
*  Yeah, I mean, this'll be one of the stories,
*  but I guess the bigger question is,
*  should it even be that big of a story
*  that this is it for LeBron,
*  probably at least on a Laker run?
*  If they had Kyrie Irving,
*  do you think that would have changed the series?
*  Because I'm not sure.
*  I just feel like maybe they win two games,
*  but I just don't think anyone's beating Denver.
*  Yeah, them beating Denver is like a whole other part
*  of the conversation.
*  But yeah, I mean, like a more competitive series.
*  I think so for sure.
*  I've been a weird Kyrie defender lately.
*  Yeah, he's been good.
*  Serra was giving me a bunch of shit for drafting him
*  and like an All-Star thing we did last year.
*  I was like, the cloudiness of all his off court stuff
*  made us forget.
*  And the Dallas stuff has reminded us, I feel like,
*  that like, yeah, this dude's like one of the best
*  basketball players alive.
*  I think he would have made a difference,
*  but it's all hindsight now.
*  But he would have made a difference
*  in actually winning a series different
*  or just making it more interesting?
*  Well, maybe not against the Nuggets.
*  Maybe Denver's a 2-1?
*  Yeah, maybe not against the Nuggets.
*  So they draw, LeBron at this point in his career
*  draws the worst possible double beat.
*  One is that he just has this monolith in front of him.
*  It's something he never had to deal with
*  his entire East run, right?
*  He's in the East from 11 to 18.
*  There was really no team on any level of the team.
*  The one team that really had a chance was the Bulls,
*  and then Rose hurt his knee.
*  That was the one team I felt like had a chance
*  maybe to get their talent versus talent.
*  Celtics got old as the early 2010s and never had it.
*  And then the Golden State piece, he goes to the Lakers.
*  Durant blows out his Achilles,
*  then ends up leaving Golden State,
*  and then Murray gets hurt.
*  And it just seems like it's gonna be the same situation
*  where there's no dominant team.
*  And then all of a sudden last year,
*  there's a dominant team.
*  And I don't know what the move is for him.
*  And maybe it doesn't matter.
*  He's had an unbelievable career.
*  He got 40,000 points.
*  He has four titles.
*  He wants some MVPs.
*  He's gonna have a lot of the long-term records.
*  And maybe he's just gonna want to be like,
*  you know what, I want to play with my son,
*  and that's gonna be it.
*  So he's gonna be playing for...
*  Dallas?
*  Well, I was gonna say the,
*  what's the Mexico City G League team
*  or something like he's gonna be...
*  Well, no, they'll bring...
*  Relegate himself.
*  They'll bring Ronnie up.
*  Yeah, when he turned that ball over late in the game,
*  that one that was sort of like an unforced turnover,
*  it had a weird energy about it.
*  And I texted one of my friends what you were talking about.
*  I was like, that felt just sort of symbolic to me.
*  I don't know.
*  There was something about it.
*  And he was like, you're reading into this too much,
*  but that's just what we do, I guess.
*  But he doesn't strike me as somebody that's gonna...
*  I think he takes a lot of pride
*  in still being so competitive,
*  and that's part of his legacy.
*  I'd be...
*  It seems like it would be a really weird left turn
*  for him to just be like, I'm good.
*  I feel like LeBron's gonna kinda die on the battlefield.
*  Well, then that means he's gotta switch teams.
*  Yeah, I would say so.
*  Not gonna...
*  And people will be like, no, they have a couple picks.
*  They'll be able to get somebody.
*  It's like, there's nobody they're gonna be able to get
*  that they're gonna have enough assets to actually get,
*  let's say Devin Booker, asset of Phoenix.
*  Let's say that goes sideways.
*  They're not gonna have enough assets for him.
*  Guess who's gonna have to be in the trade?
*  Anthony Davis.
*  So you're going sideways with whatever,
*  or you're gonna have to roll the dice with somebody
*  that's like a distressed asset,
*  which they've been doing for the last couple years.
*  And ironically, all this starts
*  with the Russell Westbrook trade,
*  where they give up some real assets.
*  They give up a pick.
*  Then they're stuck with Westbrook.
*  They have to attach a pick just to get rid of him
*  to get the guys back.
*  There's a fork in the road there
*  where they could have rolled the dice with Kyrie,
*  but you can't really blame them,
*  considering they've taken two firsts,
*  where Kyrie's head was at.
*  And it's just the situation is what it is.
*  Yeah, this is the first time
*  I felt like I could see the finish line for him.
*  I don't know.
*  Unless he starts doing mid-level exception,
*  or just like, I'm just gonna join this team for two million
*  because I wanna win a fifth.
*  I don't know if he'd wanna do that.
*  I don't, like, could you see him being like,
*  I'm gonna, wouldn't be the Celtics
*  because he hates Boston, but,
*  so Denver, Minnesota wouldn't be,
*  Dallas would, I guess, be the team.
*  I'm gonna join Dallas.
*  I'm now on Dallas for one year, two million bucks,
*  wanna play with Luca, moving to Texas.
*  It's just weird, I don't see him doing it.
*  I'm trying to think of a team
*  that really could use him that has,
*  because the Cleveland thing I don't think would work.
*  They would have to move off of a lot of people.
*  How about Philly?
*  Him and Allen and Mobley couldn't play together,
*  but they probably figured out.
*  Oh, the Cleveland homecoming would be interesting.
*  Yeah, because him and Mitchell and-
*  They'd probably make a trade.
*  Yeah, him and Mitchell and Garland could work together.
*  Like, I think like the passing,
*  him as like a passing kind of fulcrum
*  between those two guys could work if Mitchell even stayed.
*  Philly's interesting, Philly's interesting.
*  I don't know, is Embiid even gonna be in Philly though?
*  That's a good question.
*  You know, you hear that, even from Philly fans,
*  they're like, oh, he wants outta here, so I don't know.
*  It's hard to say, man. Orlando?
*  Yeah, Orlando. Maybe LeBron or Show LeBron
*  the tape of Orlando, game three,
*  just laying the smackdown on Cleveland.
