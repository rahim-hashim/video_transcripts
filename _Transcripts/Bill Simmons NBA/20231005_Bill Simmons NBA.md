# Ryen Russillo on the Recent NBA Moves and Matchups Next Season | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [October 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMuqDj2B6xk)
*  Ryan Rossellos here.
*  We're talking drew holiday, the big trade.
*  How is the NBA different for you right now?
*  And are we done?
*  Do we finally have the 30 rosters?
*  Is this what we're looking at?
*  Do we know who's going to be on everybody's team or are we somehow not done?
*  I never think we're done anymore in the NBA.
*  And I know you're being a gracious host here, but you and I talked for five
*  minutes today, I think you have the headline take on this.
*  Okay.
*  I think you have the headline take on like what the top of the league looks like.
*  Are you ready to share it this early?
*  I think Boston has the best top six.
*  I did not feel that way 24 hours ago.
*  I did not feel like there was a clear best.
*  I trust this team and crunch time.
*  And if poor Zynga stays healthy, which is a huge F I think they have the
*  best six and they can fill around and they have the most ways that they
*  can play whoever in the series.
*  So from that vantage point, you had to do the trade and they gave up.
*  Uh, a center who has been hurt every single year, and I don't fully trust
*  that he's ever going to be out there when it matters, Brogdon, who was hurt
*  and who was mad at the team and two picks and you get true holiday, who was a 2021
*  finals hero, who's one of the best defensive guards in the league, who's still
*  really good and just raises their ceiling.
*  Now you can go and go white holiday, Tatum Brown and a center at crunch time.
*  And you're good.
*  You can switch on almost everything, especially if you get anything from
*  Horford.
*  So were you similarly enthused?
*  Yeah, I love Drew.
*  You know, there's some stuff with his, his shooting in the playoffs where it's
*  been pretty bad or you're like, is that just cause he can't make shots at the
*  playoffs or is it just what happened statistically?
*  I mean, it does happen.
*  Uh, I mean, if I'm getting the negative parts out of the way, like, yeah, sure.
*  He's a little bit older.
*  Uh, the big situation is a huge question mark.
*  Uh, I can't believe what they got from, from Horford last year.
*  Like, so I don't know if you can just pencil that in cause he was way beyond
*  expectations, uh, at least for me or for what I had for him.
*  But when you can add Drew for those pieces and I'm with you, like when, when Rob
*  Williams is right, it's really, really nice, but you can even tell when he's out
*  there, you're like, is something wrong with him again?
*  You know, the number of times that I've watched Rob Williams and Celtics games,
*  I'm like, he, I know he's out there, but wait, something.
*  And every time I thought Marcus Smart was trying to get, end his career with
*  some of those LLU passes, like depending on how he'd land.
*  And so like how is this going to be the last one we ever see from him?
*  So to me, it makes a lot of sense.
*  By the way, that Rob point, my dad texted me after the trade.
*  He's like, Oh, I hate giving up Rob.
*  I'm like, you complained about Rob more than anybody I know in my life.
*  You would text me from the games going up.
*  Rob's just often the Rob just walked in the tunnel again.
*  I don't know what happened.
*  Um, I just like Brian Barrett had a tweet, 32 games, 29 games, 52 games,
*  61 games, 35 games.
*  Those are Rob Williams his last five years.
*  It just wasn't reliable enough for a team that's trying to win a title.
*  I interrupted you.
*  No, you didn't because it's a, it's a really good point.
*  Cause what's going to happen.
*  I mean, you know, it's just, there's, there's definitely like a
*  presenctus is hurt.
*  It feels like the whole thing is screwed up and there's a really
*  good chance that that could happen.
*  But if you're talking about like the allocation of minutes and the talent
*  that's getting those minutes, well, the talent that's getting those minutes
*  just went up with drew holiday.
*  And that's, I think the simplest way to look at it.
*  So they, they turn Marcus smart and grant Williams and Brogdon and Rob
*  Williams into drew holiday and poor Zingas more Derek white minutes, more
*  Peyton Pritchard minutes.
*  And then there's a little bit of an X factor with who's going to be like
*  that ninth man, 10th man kind of big slash four slash five person, maybe
*  I don't know if he plays more or somebody you trade like that.
*  I feel like that's the easiest position to pick up in January and February.
*  The big thing for me is I think white was ready for a bigger role.
*  I think white and holiday together is magnificent as a, as a backcourt.
*  And I read some stuff today.
*  They think white's going to come off the bench.
*  I don't know if I see that.
*  I think I would come out of the gates with white and holiday and Tatum
*  and Brown in the center and maybe bring to your Horford point, like maybe
*  bring Horford off the bench and try really try to rest his minutes during
*  the season and be careful with him.
*  And make them a bench player.
*  And then the playoffs reassess.
*  But I think that having those four guys all together, they complement each other
*  so well, um, you can play basically any kind of defense against any perimeter
*  guy in the league, those four guys.
*  And they're just better.
*  I mean, there's, there's just no way around it.
*  They're better.
*  He's a much better player than Marcus smart was last year.
*  And you know, you've made that point about the shooting.
*  He'd have those games.
*  He'd go five for 22 in a playoff game.
*  You know, he, he, but I, I do feel like he was asked to do a little bit more than
*  maybe what he's supposed to be doing.
*  I don't feel like he's a pure point guard right now.
*  You have white who can handle most of the ball handling.
*  He could play off the ball and they're going to get the best version.
*  And awesome locker room guy too, by all accounts.
*  I mean, really like a beloved teammate wherever he went.
*  I think they wanted to change the chemistry a little bit.
*  I think this was an unhappier team than maybe they led on to
*  the outside world last year.
*  Yeah, look, I definitely like him more than smart.
*  And, uh, you know, to be, you know, totally fair when I'm looking at like the
*  Lillard side of this trade last week, before we knew the second piece of Drew
*  and upgrading from Drew to Lillard, I'm going, okay, well now you're top two in
*  Milwaukee's like in the argument for the best two in the NBA.
*  Okay.
*  And that's, that's really what this league has been about now post the
*  teens decade where it was the arms race for your top three.
*  It's you look around the league, you go, okay, who's got the two best?
*  Like let's come up with the five teams who have the two best.
*  And with Lillard and Giannis, that's like a whole nother level.
*  So when I was looking at it as like Lillard compared to Drew, you know,
*  Drew is not somebody you're expecting to break down a defense off the dribble.
*  Right.
*  Oh, and we're stuck into the shot clock, like make something happen where
*  Lillard can literally do anything right into the final second of the shot clock
*  and still get you feel like it's still a decent look.
*  So that part of it's a huge upgrade, but he's number three to four, as far as
*  an offensive option, he also, and I don't know, this is just me talking about
*  loud as I thought about the trade.
*  It's pretty clear that when Boston's offense gets into trouble in the
*  playoffs, like Tatum and Brown haven't figured out a way to kind of unlock it.
*  Other than just like, I can already picture my head.
*  Like I know what the Tatum move is going to be.
*  I already know what the Jalen Brown move is going to be.
*  I don't know if smart was able to, to make their life easier with the playmaking.
*  Yeah.
*  And then sometimes I even think smart would go like, well, if you guys are
*  going to screw around, like I might just, I might just be green light on this possession.
*  I don't think drew necessarily plays that way.
*  So, you know, it's, it's probably silly for me to think that like, Drew's
*  going to be the Steve Nash type who comes in and sets up all these great
*  late playoff possessions, but there may be something in lessening the burden
*  of those guys feeling like they have to do or defaulting to just forcing the
*  issue as much as they do in the playoffs.
*  I like how much ball handling they have to your point.
*  Cause they were talking about experimenting a little bit more, but
*  cause they were talking about experimenting a little bit more with
*  Tatum as a point forward this year, which makes me nervous a little bit just cause.
*  You know, he's six foot nine.
*  I'm not, I'm not sure that's the best use of him, but they seem pretty adamant.
*  Like we feel like he could be a little bit more of a creator.
*  And then you think white can do that.
*  I, to me, white is the key to this season now, because if, you know, other
*  than the presenius health thing, which I almost I'm going to knock on wood.
*  Um, but they, part of the reason they made all this movement and they got rid
*  of Brogdon and smart was I think they really wanted to push white to be.
*  The lead ball handler for them and a creator.
*  And there's some unbelievable pick and roll stats with him.
*  And, uh, and just if certain people set him a pick in the way, even in the Miami
*  series, he was one of the only guys who could create offense.
*  So I think they have that plus they have drew.
*  And the reality is for drew, this is, this might be the deepest
*  offensive team he's been on.
*  Right.
*  When you think back to like, had some, was on some pretty weird Philly teams
*  and some pretty weird New Orleans teams.
*  And even when Milwaukee was at its best, it was really just Yanis
*  Middleton and drew, and that was it.
*  This, this there's more shooting and playmaking around him than I think we've seen.
*  Maybe it'll be a slight upgrade on the flip side.
*  He doesn't have Yanis who was the second best player of the century probably.
*  But I liked the spot for him.
*  It seemed like he really wanted to go to a contending team.
*  And I don't really know who they were competing against because for reading
*  through some of the reports, it just seemed like Philly, I don't even know
*  what the trade was for them.
*  Portland wanted at least one piece back, probably two that they
*  could do their keeper package.
*  They wanted picks back.
*  Golden state wasn't even in it.
*  And it didn't seem like okay.
*  See ever through their hat in the ring, which I was shocked by.
*  Cause I felt like, okay.
*  See was the sleeping giant of this whole thing with door and some picks and just
*  say, fuck it.
*  Let's, let's see if we can be really good this year.
*  So it's, it goes down to Boston, the Quippers.
*  They just had more assets.
*  Um, I don't know if Portland keeps Rob.
*  He's on a good contract there to have Aitin.
*  My guess is they're, they're probably spinning him.
*  Does it make sense to have both of those guys?
*  Uh, my sense is they're going to try it out, you know, but, you know, the
*  thing with Rob is like, if you think he's an awesome defensive player that's just
*  out there, like he's awesome when he's used a certain way.
*  And once Boston unlocked that two years ago, where they stuck them on a non
*  shooting big, and then you could see other teams adapt to it.
*  It's like, well, let's stop giving them an out where Rob can just roam off of
*  this dude that's not a shame threat.
*  Cause I think that, you know, this is just going to turn into like now that
*  he's not here, but I mean, have you listened to us talk about Rob Williams
*  at all last couple of years?
*  Uh, he, you know, he, I don't, I don't think he's.
*  I know what the defensive metrics are.
*  I know the on-off stuff.
*  It's a big reason why I think the analytics models always love Boston.
*  Like sometimes you look at him and be like, Hey, I think this team's good,
*  but like these numbers are overwhelming.
*  This is like, it's, it's so far, like as if there's this huge gap between
*  Boston and everybody else, which I never really felt, uh, going back to
*  these last two years, but if you're Chauncey Billups and you think like,
*  okay, Rob Williams is just going to go out there and like wreak havoc.
*  It's like, well, he has to be used a certain way.
*  So maybe they feel like that's in defensive support to Aitin and with
*  Aitin, you know, I have, I'm not quite sure what to expect.
*  I, well, this is the one thing he's probably going to put up huge numbers
*  because he's not going to have older dudes that have a higher status in
*  the league that go, I'm sick of passing it to you, so he's probably going
*  to get more touches.
*  We'll probably see like early Aitin numbers and like, like 22, 10 for
*  the first six weeks of the season.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm with you.
*  Yeah.
*  Like he'll, he'll, he'll put up some big numbers there, but.
*  You know, defensively it's really about his competitiveness because there
*  were times, I think going back two years ago, when we were thinking about him
*  with that run in the sons of the finals, you're like, look at this guy, like he
*  can switch out on the smaller players.
*  You can rotate, but it's all about the way he's wired.
*  And I think long-term, unfortunately, like we already kind of know the answer there.
*  Like, I don't think all of a sudden now you start playing with some fierceness
*  after being in the league this long.
*  So he was the fifth option on that team and there seemed to be real resentment
*  toward him.
*  Yeah.
*  In that whole Phoenix culture of like, why doesn't he just realize we
*  don't need his offense?
*  We need him to basically rebound and block shots and crash the offensive boards.
*  I think his attitude was probably 25 years old.
*  I want to be the best player I can be.
*  I already went to a finals.
*  I don't, that's not, I think I could do more than that.
*  So I don't, I don't think anyone was necessarily wrong.
*  As I said, I know my Thursday pot, I just hated the trade for Phoenix.
*  I just thought they got the poo poo platter back.
*  You know, they got some, some, some spare ribs back and a couple of egg rolls.
*  And, and that's it, but they did not get an entree back.
*  And I think he's an entree on the right team, whether he's a guide that made
*  sense for them, I don't know, but I know that they didn't get a good haul for him.
*  I think Rob for his contract, for what his talents are is a really intriguing
*  piece for them or for another team, because you could trade for him and it's
*  not like a daunting salary, right?
*  I think he's in, what is, what is it like 15 a year or something like that?
*  I'm going to look at it.
*  No, it's a really good, yeah.
*  I mean, it was a really low cost extension and he's still a pretty young guy.
*  Yeah.
*  So, uh, from the Boston standpoint though, they are all in now.
*  I mean, this is a really expensive team that has, you're talking just this year,
*  Drew's at 36 KP's at 36 Tatum's 37.6.
*  JB is 32.
*  Um, Derek White's 18.3 and Al is 10.
*  So from a tax standpoint, this, this bumped them up 14.4 million.
*  They're, they're potentially a super tax team unless they, uh, can do some
*  shaving, but they just have six really big contracts now.
*  And I think, I don't think they care.
*  I think they're in the mode of like this, this league can be stolen.
*  Denver is a little worse from a depth standpoint.
*  The Lakers are, are tied to whatever LeBron's health is going to be.
*  Milwaukee has Giannis and Dane, but really a lot of, uh, you know, a lot of
*  subpar defense and perimeter stuff for them, I think is going to be a real
*  issue beyond the two man game.
*  Philly's worse.
*  Miami's either the same or worse, depending on how you feel about
*  some of their young guys.
*  And then the West is like, I started doing my MBA research this weekend.
*  We're so the West is like, it's a bloodbath.
*  There's like 11 teams that I think had plus had minus playoff odds to make the
*  playoffs.
*  Um, they, there can only be eight and you know, I think there's going to be some
*  zero sum game stuff there.
*  And especially if somebody loses a guy for 20 games, it could be a dramatic,
*  all of a sudden you go from like a three seed to the 10 seed.
*  If you lose one of your best guys for 20 games.
*  So I just think the South's looked at the league as a whole and they were like,
*  the East is significantly worse and we could be a one seed and we could
*  potentially dominate this conference.
*  And I'm here for it.
*  Ultimately it's going to matter.
*  Does Tatum go up a level or not?
*  You know, cause you're always as good as your best guy.
*  Can Tatum become a top five guy in the league and battle these dudes and the
*  biggest, biggest, biggest, biggest games in the biggest series combined with this
*  cast they have, I'm pro the trade.
*  I applaud them for going all in on it.
*  And I'm actually surprised he didn't go for more because think of that.
*  Oh, it's a 33.
*  I mean, you know, 33 good, pretty fair contract with the player option.
*  Um, they gave away two picks that probably, you know, it's this warrior's
*  pick in 24 that's top four protected.
*  They gave up their own unprotected in 29.
*  Brogdon who, you know, I don't think was, there was exactly a hot market and then
*  Williams.
*  So I thought that was pretty, pretty solid value for them.
*  I thought he was going to go for more than that.
*  It feels like it's always just the number of picks now anyway.
*  And you got to wonder if you've worked for the Celtics and you're a college
*  scout, you're like, Hey Brad, what do you hate picks?
*  Do you care if I, if I do some bartending in the side, is it okay if I get a second
*  job?
*  Hey, did you go to the Metro semi-finals?
*  No, I'm at the cast.
*  Yeah.
*  Send those scouts to Europe to just scout the, uh, the Euro league and all those
*  different things.
*  Look, you just made a really good point.
*  Like really the way the drew thing will be judged will be based on Tatum
*  ceiling and wherever that is.
*  And it still feels a little weird that we're this many years into Tatum.
*  And you know, it's not like there are these Epic flame outs in the playoffs.
*  No, we're taught.
*  We're talking about NBA finals and then when the States get raised, but it
*  like the Celts are turning into the Buffalo Bills a little bit where it's like,
*  and granted, I still can't believe they got down three out of the Miami heat and
*  they ended up losing the series and you know, credit to the heat and everything.
*  But it's like, look, it's not like they're, they keep losing in the second round
*  all of a sudden.
*  So I don't, I don't quite understand that.
*  Or maybe it's just because the stakes are raised and you know, they haven't got
*  it done in the last couple of years or they'd lost the, you know, but I, maybe
*  it's the Easter con finals where I felt like when they were losing those prior to
*  the last two years, I was like, I don't know.
*  I was kind of amazed.
*  They were even in a lot of those Eastern conference finals.
*  The offense got so stagnant that it just felt like against a certain type of team.
*  They weren't going to be able to score at a high enough level to actually win the
*  title. That was the takeaway from 22 and I think 23.
*  Yeah.
*  And 20, it was just too hard for them to score at some point.
*  Yeah.
*  22.
*  I completely agree with it, but like when it comes specific to Tatum and, you
*  know, maybe I'm just going off of like the millions of guys that want to talk to
*  me about it, that are from back home.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know, he can go for 51 in a, in a clinching game.
*  And then the next bad game, it's like, I don't know if this guy has it.
*  And, but the thing is, it's like, I'm not completely dismissive of it either.
*  And that's probably the challenge of being a franchise guy who's not really a top
*  five player in the league.
*  Like when I look at, when I look at some of the player rankings and I see Tatum
*  ahead of Booker every time I disagree with it.
*  And so I know Booker's resume isn't the same necessarily, even though, you know,
*  they sort of are the same, but I don't know if you, if you agree or disagree
*  with that, but I don't know if that's just because I've, I've sat and listened
*  to all of this Tatum stuff.
*  And then they had those games too, where I've watched Tatum where I'm like, wait,
*  like where, where's this guy at right now?
*  Is it just dribble, dribble, dribble step back three the whole time?
*  Like, do I want them to miss layups?
*  Will that make me feel better?
*  You know, like I don't, it's the off season for me and thinking about it, but I
*  think specific to Tatum, like he, he's, he's going to be what happens here.
*  It's not going to be any of this other stuff really.
*  Yeah.
*  And the history of the NBA says the age is in his factor that over these next three
*  years, he should take a leap, right?
*  It's not, he's not maxed out yet.
*  He's hitting his 26, 27, 28 seasons.
*  And this is usually when you climb and you peak as a player.
*  And I think the Celtics are banking on that.
*  So is it fair to say for 2024, at least for this upcoming season, Boston,
*  Milwaukee is now the best game.
*  That's the most interesting.
*  Anytime those two play, I will go out of my way to watch this between Yanis and
*  Dame drew playing his old team drew and Derek white against Dame Yanis go and
*  against his Boston team that doesn't have grant Williams anymore, who always did
*  like a half decent job, keeping them in check.
*  Um, the fact that I think those are now the two best teams in the East.
*  Kind of definitively, and they're going to be measuring each other this whole time.
*  Plus you have Yanis.
*  I don't know.
*  It's year by year for him and Milwaukee at this point, uh, Boston all in with
*  this team financially, I just feel like this is somehow the marquee matchup now
*  in the league, would you say, would you go warriors Lakers or Lakers, Denver, or
*  would you, what would you say?
*  It feels like Denver is being like entirely dismissed with all this stuff.
*  Um, as this happens, I don't want to do that.
*  That's what I was trying to think of.
*  Like what's their, I don't know if they have a kind of a rival measuring stick
*  team equivalent to this Boston Milwaukee thing where this for nine months, these
*  will just be these two teams that are now eyeing each other.
*  And then you're going to have Miami over on the side going, Oh, you're going to
*  count us out.
*  We're not in this.
*  So he could, and they're going to have a huge chip on their shoulder again.
*  So you can kind of see where the East is going.
*  Philly and beat already had his depressing tweet today and Philly, I mean,
*  they're over under on Fandel was 48 and a half.
*  Them getting a 49 wins seems almost inconceivable to me.
*  I can't wait to watch the Sixers this year.
*  I mean, I cannot wait because what a car crash, like I just, what is Harden going
*  to do because up in mistakes against Maury.
*  He's that stuff from the club the other day with the Darrell Moore is a liar
*  sign, like what, this is the weirdest heading into media day situation.
*  I think we've had since Kobe and Shaq broke up.
*  And this is the last time I remember like, Oh my God, I, this whole, this is
*  going to be a whole saga.
*  Um, this is like, I don't know where this goes.
*  Well, cause hard to play a game for them.
*  Right.
*  Cause Harden and his, his reps are thinking like, Hey, the big deal is
*  still out there for you, but how do you prove where you were?
*  Well, I'm not saying I know where, but what do you think that you think those
*  guys are sitting around going up too bad?
*  You're just, you're going to be a $15 million a year guy now.
*  Like, of course they don't believe that.
*  And he's in his own rest.
*  Even if they don't believe that.
*  They have that 30 day role where if you don't report within a certain amount of
*  time, you lose your free agency for the next season.
*  So you have to at least be somewhat professional.
*  So he's going to have to report.
*  Does he fake an injury?
*  Does he just say I'm not talking and actually like plays pretty well.
*  And then the other question for me is all on the table.
*  It's all on the table.
*  He's a legendary quitter.
*  No one will be better than him when he's inducted into the hall of fame.
*  That should be on the bus.
*  Quit in ways no one ever thought invented new ways to quit.
*  Well, Kyle, cue the Tik TOK camera up for this question.
*  If Miami acquired Harden, my initial reaction would be, Oh my God, that's
*  insane.
*  And then after five minutes, I'd be like, Holy shit, that might've been a good
*  trade.
*  That might be the only team left that can save him.
*  If they go and it's like just Kyle Lowry and you know, protected 2028 first,
*  like basically that's his value.
*  Now you're looking at 15 cents on the dollar for somebody who is a top 15 guy
*  halfway through last season.
*  But if you're Miami and you missed out on all this other stuff, are you happy
*  with what you have or do you bank on the fact that you have Riley and Spolstra
*  and Jimmy Butler and BAM and this certain culture in place and Harden's going to
*  have to come in there and be like, you know what, let's bet on the talent.
*  We can afford one knucklehead.
*  Can't have two, but you can have one.
*  I think it's an interesting idea for them.
*  They're too smart because here's the other thing is like Harden is not even
*  close.
*  Right.
*  They're too smart.
*  Like whatever you want to say about it.
*  It's seduced by James Harden.
*  And I mean, the obvious joke of Harden in South Beach is if it's some recovery
*  thing, you mean like, OK, he's going to he's going to redeem himself there and
*  lock in.
*  I mean, he's trying to simultaneously tank a team situation while proving that
*  he's worth the money that he's already passed on twice.
*  This is unprecedented stuff.
*  I want to 30 to 30 on this.
*  Like, don't ever let them tell you you're not worth anything if you're actually
*  worth less or like whatever.
*  You know, I could I could workshop.
*  What if I told you someone costs themselves 100 billion dollars over the
*  course of three years and ended up playing in Hong Kong still wanted 200
*  million?
*  You know, so I don't I don't know how it's going to go.
*  You know, the default is always the teams are scared to death of the guy going
*  like, hey, I need a second opinion on this knee.
*  They get the second opinion.
*  They go, OK, so I'm not actually holding out.
*  There's nothing you can do.
*  Like I remember at one point with Ben Simmons going, oh, wow, this is actually
*  pretty admirable.
*  He's not going to fake an injury like he could go, you know, I'm going to see six
*  that's a little tweaked or whatever.
*  And it's like, no, I'm actually going to go with the mental health route and then
*  tweet videos that I'm back for like two plus years and do a bunch of sit downs
*  talking about how awesome going to be five on five now is back.
*  Yeah, no, look out.
*  So I don't think the heat.
*  First of all, I think the heat was obviously very disappointed for a million
*  different reasons on the timeline.
*  There were probably some other deals out there for them.
*  They held off. They thought they were getting game the whole time.
*  What do you think? What do you think was out there for them that they now regret
*  not chasing?
*  Cause I think they were pretty certain that this game thing was going to play
*  their way, including letting Vincent and streus leave.
*  Those aren't deal breakers.
*  I think they can survive without those guys.
*  But I also think if they felt that Dame wasn't happening, I think they might've
*  kept one of those guys.
*  I know streus got a lot of money.
*  I don't know.
*  Can I, can I read you their team now?
*  They got BAM, Kevin Love, Jimmy Butler, Tyler here on Kyle Lowry's.
*  They're starting five, Caleb Barton, Duncan Robinson, Hakez,
*  Jovich, Thomas Bryant.
*  I'm not counting that team out.
*  Counting them out in which way?
*  No, I, cause I know they'll have a weird regular season and it'll be up and down
*  and you know, they'll crawl their way to 45 and 37, whatever with that roster.
*  But in the playoffs, I don't want to see them.
*  I'm just, I'm on the record permanently.
*  I don't ever want to see that team in the playoffs and it's not just cause they
*  lost Vincent and streus doesn't mean we should be like, well, cross them off.
*  But I think as a regular season team, Milwaukee and Boston just are clearly
*  poised for more wins and more success.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, this took way too long to circle back around, but if we're just talking
*  to Eastern conference, it's, it's Milwaukee, it's Boston.
*  Um, and I know like the, the rule will be, we have to sit there and say, well,
*  you can't rule out the heat.
*  Like you just said, I mean, again, I can't believe what happened last year, but
*  there are also things happening that had literally never happened before and they
*  were all happening at the same time.
*  For Caleb Martin to turn into what we thought Donovan Mitchell would be in
*  the playoffs is one thing.
*  Well, what Jimmy did in Milwaukee in round one was almost unprecedented
*  historically, right?
*  Like that's Jordan stuff that he did against them.
*  Okay.
*  He turned into Michael Jordan for two weeks.
*  Right.
*  And then, you know, even the one game they won against Denver, that fourth
*  quarter was the most efficient single fourth quarter of any game for any team
*  in the entire regular season in playoffs.
*  That's what they had to do.
*  And they still did it to even get one of those games.
*  So I know that I'm supposed to just go, Hey, you have to, you have to pencil
*  them in on that one line, not as a one seed, but you have to go Milwaukee, Boston
*  and then Miami to be respectful.
*  And I want to be respectful of it, but I still can't help but think like
*  last year was fluky.
*  It just, it just kind of was.
*  I'm surprised they didn't go after drew.
*  It's like the quintessential heat guy.
*  Yeah.
*  But then would it take in Lowry and some picks?
*  But obviously that got super ornery on both sides.
*  I don't even know if they can call.
*  Like, can they call for it?
*  I mean, it all depends on which side of the argument you want to.
*  I mean, I know we've been over this for like three months and all came to a head
*  when the deal finally went down, but you know, if Portland didn't want to deal
*  with Miami, I don't know that that's necessarily wrong.
*  Like Portland felt like Miami was in this and the agent was telling everybody in
*  the league, don't trade for them.
*  And clearly Dame was certain that it would only be Miami because we're used to
*  the players always getting their way.
*  Yeah.
*  My point was, you know, for, for months, I was like, how many times do you have
*  to make a decision where you're like, I'm only doing this and I'm never doing this
*  and I won't do this and I won't move here, but I won't do that show, but I'll
*  do this show or whatever.
*  And then like, it comes down to the very end.
*  You're like, all right, I guess I can do that show or I guess I could live there.
*  I guess I can come to the yacht.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like you, you end up compromising a little bit and that's where I think
*  Portland was kind of smart.
*  So I don't, I don't necessarily blame Portland for taking it personally
*  because I think the agent part of it really pissed them off.
*  But at the end of the day, like, do you want to add it all up and compare
*  what the hero packages?
*  And I don't even know if we know what the final Miami offer is because based
*  on the timeline of all the reporting last week, cause they hadn't really even
*  talked and gotten up in a formal, like yes, no, here's our best offer in mid July.
*  So I, even if it were going to be a third first from Miami and hero and some
*  of the other salary filler and you know, yeah, for the record, I like Jovoch a lot.
*  I liked them before the draft.
*  I liked what we saw this summer.
*  But I don't know, like, even if you think it was personal and unprofessional
*  on Portland side, do you think they did worse?
*  They got players that they need for the players they already have.
*  And I have two centers, they have more trade stuff and, um, it, there's no way
*  it didn't make more sense to do the two deals that they did.
*  Right.
*  Cause like, you know, joking about the hall of fame thing, like I think OGN
*  and Obi should get in just based on who he hasn't been offered for.
*  Like, you know, he was, he was more of a role guy, but.
*  Masai said no to Durant.
*  He said no to Lillard.
*  He said like, he just, and we're like, we, we, he's head of the Springfield.
*  And the same thing, 16 and five for three straight years.
*  Can't, can't sacrifice that guy.
*  And then when hero gets inducted, we'd be like, you know, we know he was kind of
*  primarily a scorer and he's not the normal, but for, for three months, he was
*  one of the greats, he was one of the greats.
*  I'm granted it was during the off season, but he was one of the great players of
*  all time and you know, obviously I'm having fun with this a little bit, but
*  when you started digging around, like hearing what hero could be flipped for,
*  like if hero were so great and so valuable, then get a three-way deal going
*  here where those pieces that are being given up for hero, because the other team
*  believes all the propaganda from the summer that then they get flipped to
*  Portland in this deal.
*  So however you feel about the tensions.
*  I think Brooklyn messed that up.
*  I think Brooklyn should have jumped in and tried to, tried to steal hero and
*  give some picks that Miami could have used.
*  I like hero as an asset.
*  I just didn't think he made sense for Portland, but I still like him as a
*  player offensive player.
*  What player piece was going from Brooklyn to Portland to appease what it appears
*  like they actually wanted to put together an actual starting five.
*  You know, I'm saying I would have traded some, I would have traded a couple first
*  for hero if I was Brooklyn, I would have traded a couple of those Phoenix first.
*  Oh, and just sat on it.
*  No.
*  So that my, for hero, so that Miami would have more picks to offer for Dane.
*  If my, if Miami was in Portland, doesn't want hero, you need to get picks for
*  hero to put in the Dame trade and I'm Brooklyn and I'm sitting there.
*  I would have tried to get them.
*  Cause okay.
*  Okay.
*  But I think he's still asking you above average guard.
*  Uh, no, I think he's good.
*  I think he's good too, but it just became, I think, for three months.
*  It was, we said this, it didn't make any sense.
*  It was going to be sharp sign of scoob and hero.
*  Those four guys aren't playing together.
*  So, but, but it seems clear between eight and Rob that Portland actually
*  wanted a couple of people they could pencil into their starting five.
*  And so if hero goes to Brooklyn for picks and now Miami can offer three and two
*  swaps or whatever, and you know, the swaps just kind of blow all this stuff out of
*  the portion, by the way, there's another version of this too, where it's like, do
*  I really care about swaps with Miami?
*  Because there's a pretty good chance that the worst Miami season is still really
*  good because they've got the best, you know, who knows the next guy that's
*  actually going to want to go there.
*  They're not going to go over everyone.
*  They've had two bad seasons of like 30 years, the Milwaukee getting Milwaukee swaps
*  and getting that Milwaukee and protected is super appealing if I'm Portland,
*  because now you're banking on like, yeah, is it 50 50?
*  Yannis is still there in five years, you know, based on the history of the league
*  and how things go and how guys move around and all of a sudden you could be
*  sitting there, you know, swaps, big wise was doing a whole thing on swaps that I
*  enjoyed about how the swaps never since Boston, Brooklyn, the swaps don't come
*  through nearly as much as you think it would be an interesting research project
*  to actually see how many of them hit.
*  But I think in the Milwaukee case, those are, those are swaps I would rather have
*  than a Boston swap or a Milwaukee swap.
*  By the way, Boston kept some flexibility.
*  They still are able to trade, I think two more first and some swaps and they have
*  like eight second round picks.
*  So they have, if they want to do one more thing, I just don't know.
*  I don't really fully understand the super tax yet and just how punitive it is,
*  but, um, they could still make the roster better.
*  Can I read you Philly's starting nine right now?
*  Or their top nine and bead Harris, Tucker, hearted and maxi Melton,
*  Reed, cork, Moz and Beverly.
*  That's what I have for their top nine.
*  And you got Harris on an expiring contract with 40 million bucks.
*  Um, and they don't really have any picks they can attach to anybody and they got
*  to figure out the heart and peace, but it doesn't seem like anybody wants them.
*  And I gotta say, I'm surprised that Clippers haven't bid on that.
*  I think it really speaks to how bad Harden's reputation is right now that the
*  Clippers are like, yeah, Terrence man too rich for our blood.
*  We got to stay out.
*  Like you thought if I had said to you in February, the Clippers have a chance to
*  trade Terrence man, Norm Powell and Robert Covington's expiring for James Harden.
*  And that's the entire trade.
*  You would have been like, that's insane.
*  Of course they should do that.
*  But now that's, I don't think you could get Powell or Terrence man for Harden.
*  Who's the problem?
*  The problem is, is if you're the Clippers too, is the, the reason he wants the
*  Clippers is he thinks they were going to give him the extension.
*  So what if you traded for him and then you went, let's see how this year goes.
*  And then he's like, well, at least I'm out of Philly.
*  Like I don't, I I've just never seen a guy expect something while also
*  sabotaging himself in, in such a way.
*  I mean, it'd be one thing of Harden were 27 and doing this.
*  Let's not talk about him anymore.
*  I'm tired of James Harden.
*  Um, Boston Milwaukee, you recoiled at the, is this the best rivalry, but then
*  neither one of us could come up with a better game.
*  No, no, I'm just like, ah, that's not fair to Denver, but I don't know.
*  I don't know who Denver's rival is.
*  I guess maybe it's Phoenix.
*  Maybe Denver Phoenix is good.
*  Cause then you get the Nurkic Jokic thing.
*  You get some offense on both ends.
*  So maybe that's the Western version of Boston market, but the problem is there.
*  There's more than those two teams in the West that are going to be measuring each
*  other.
*  I mean, you could make a case for the one seat in the West.
*  You could talk me into five teams.
*  You really could.
*  I think the West 51 games might be the best record in the West this year.
*  So, you know, and the fact that Denver's from a depth standpoint, you know, they're
*  putting a lot of stock in Krisha Brown to hope that he can do those Bruce Brown
*  minutes, right?
*  And not to mention Porter staying healthy for a whole year.
*  And, um, I don't know, I just don't see a juggernaut in the West and I don't
*  think it's Phoenix either.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, this isn't really even about Denver.
*  It's about the rivalry part of it.
*  So yeah, storylines in some of the Milwaukee Boston stuff that's already happened.
*  Yeah, that's fine.
*  I'll give you that.
*  Uh, and I'm not deferring because I'm, I think you're wrong and I just want to
*  move on.
*  That's fine.
*  But I just think Miami Portland, Miami Portland robbery now GM is having to be
*  seated across from each other.
*  Uh, all right.
*  I would have more stuff for you.
*  Who is a bigger loser in this whole Dame sweepstakes?
*  Was it Miami or Philly now that the Dame sweepstakes have officially pulled out.
*  I actually feel like this is worse for Philly because the merry-go-round is now
*  stopped and they are now just stuck with James Harden going forward.
*  And I don't really see a path for them to improve their team.
*  And I think probably rightly, they didn't want to trade Maxey or involve him in
*  any stuff.
*  Um, I don't know.
*  Would you, would you put Maxey, if it was Maxey and Harris and whatever pick it
*  took to, to close down Dame and just go for a two, three year window with him
*  beat and Dame, would you have done it?
*  Well, I mean, just to be consistent here.
*  Do we think Maxey, if we're making fun of the hero offer, do you think Maxey
*  and Harris and picks get it done for Philadelphia?
*  If we're, if hero, we were like, Hey, how do you play hero?
*  I don't, I think they would have to flip Maxey to a third team, which is probably
*  why I never got any traction.
*  Yeah.
*  Portland certainly does need Maxey.
*  Yeah.
*  It's kind of the same thing as much as anybody wants to debate Maxey or hero.
*  I don't know.
*  I just don't feel like doing it right now.
*  Uh, the biggest loser is that.
*  No, I know Miami feels like the answer, but at least I can look at Miami going,
*  okay, they'll move on from this and they'll figure it out and they have the best coach.
*  And, you know, if there's ever a case study for a team fighting through
*  adversity, it's, it's them last year.
*  Philly.
*  This is where the, this is where the ties in with their philosophy on everything.
*  Right.
*  It's like now they've been counted out again.
*  Now it's Boston, Milwaukee, and they're over here and they get to do the chip on
*  the shoulder thing and guess what?
*  It's going to work.
*  And I still don't want to see them in April.
*  Does it beat?
*  Are we in the clock now?
*  Yeah.
*  I think so.
*  Do you agree?
*  Yeah.
*  What was your reasoning for like, just the way the NBA works?
*  I think this hard end thing is going to be super unhappy.
*  I don't, if you were going to say like Fando gambling odds, will this
*  hard end thing be super unhappy?
*  I don't know.
*  I think I would bet on super unhappy.
*  It just feels like it's, it's headed to a really bad place and, and
*  bead knows it and he's looking at it and he's turned 30 this year.
*  He's, you know, these are peak years.
*  How many years does he have?
*  How many years physically is he going to be an elite center who
*  can play nine months a year?
*  So Harden doesn't get his wish.
*  He's going to be a leader in the NBA.
*  He's going to be a leader in the NBA.
*  He's going to be a leader in the NBA.
*  He's going to be a leader in the NBA.
*  He's going to be a leader in the NBA.
*  So Harden doesn't get his wish.
*  He has to play well if he still wants the contract.
*  So do we get the feature, the sit down?
*  Where is it?
*  Local media?
*  Is it national media?
*  Where Embiid says we're great.
*  We're on the same page.
*  Like Rachel Nichols show basketball YouTube page.
*  Very possible.
*  Um, I will not believe it by the way.
*  So I'm with you.
*  I don't even think FanDuel offers the unhappy Embiid prop.
*  They're like, we can't put that up there.
*  We had it up for a second.
*  We had to take it down.
*  People start pulling ads.
*  People were, were banging it.
*  Um, do you know that Tatum and Brown are the only guys left from the 2020 bubble Celtics?
*  I didn't.
*  Is that true?
*  In three years, every other person that they played with in the bubble
*  is no longer on the team.
*  I think this is just the league now.
*  I think it's like a fucking miracle.
*  If you have four guys on the same team for more than four years, and maybe you
*  have your top two for a while or you're in the Denver situation where you have
*  your three plus Gordon, but for the most part, like to just keep four guys or more
*  together, it's just not going to happen anymore.
*  But this, this kind of like speaks to the Milwaukee motivation behind it.
*  The league is about the top two and you know, Jamal Murray needs to be in that
*  because he's got the title, but also what he did in that Laker series and could
*  not agree more, right.
*  And then Jokic being the undisputed one now and being in his prime.
*  I mean, here's the thing.
*  Like if you really want to get into it.
*  And I was talking with somebody about this today, but like as great as Janis is.
*  If something were to happen, can he unlock the possession offensively?
*  Or is he just going to have to like out physically, which has worked.
*  All right.
*  They're already got him a ring.
*  Like what he did against Phoenix and he made all those free throws, all
*  of that different stuff.
*  Um, as good as Tatum is we've seen it get bogged down, right.
*  Um, as great as, you know, it's weird cause we kind of feel like people are
*  turning the page on Golden State, which could be a mistake, but I don't think
*  it's necessarily like the right.
*  But like Steph, Steph can, you know, Steph can cause it with his gravity.
*  He's still going to impact every possession.
*  So maybe he's still in this conversation.
*  The point that I'm trying to make and I'm taking too long to get to it is that
*  whatever you think you're going to do to Jokic it's like a great hitter who
*  never gives away at bats, like they're probably still going to get a good look.
*  They're probably going to run something that makes sense.
*  They're probably going to end with better options offensively than most teams.
*  If not every single team because of him.
*  So you want to get physical.
*  Okay, cool.
*  You want to double off of them.
*  Okay, cool.
*  We're going to do this.
*  Oh, you want to make sure to stay on the cut.
*  Okay.
*  Well now this guy is open and all these different things.
*  So even though Denver, you could look at it and go, okay, where's the depth?
*  Where's the depth?
*  The Michael Porter Jr.
*  thing is that someone little experiment anyway.
*  It's a lot like the Nash sons where just knowing that you're playing with him is
*  going to increase your efficiency and it's happening and Gordon's a perfect
*  example of that, like he's a completely different numbers guy now because having
*  Jokic there makes it that much easier.
*  So, you know, top two, even though Murray still feels like he's behind some of the
*  other guards and, you know, I'm with you.
*  They have the belt.
*  If they, if we're doing the two man championship contest, to me, they have the
*  belt, Yonis and Thamer there and Katie and Booker.
*  I think those are probably.
*  You put that ahead of three.
*  You put what Tatum Brown fourth, would you put AD and LeBron behind her?
*  Uh, in front of, I think I'd put AD and LeBron, um, behind Tatum and
*  Jalen just cause a LeBron's in his 21st year, you know, and, and I just.
*  This is ridiculous.
*  It's ridiculous.
*  I know it's just like 2003 draft.
*  Like at some point this has to end badly.
*  I don't know what year it's going to be, but so I don't know, but he's still, you
*  know, um, in the end, then there's probably a little bit of a drop off.
*  Like you go into like Embiid and Maxey and Luca and Kyrie and start trying to
*  talk yourself curry and whoever the second warrior is.
*  But I think for pure, like our two best guys are going to go against your two
*  best guys, you know, when, when it's Yoko, Jemuri playing Katie and Booker,
*  those games are going to be incredible.
*  And I mean, the Boston Milwaukee games are going to be incredible.
*  Like watching Boston throw all their shit at Dame and try to, you
*  know, make him uncomfortable.
*  We haven't seen Dame in like a really competitive basketball
*  situation since 2019.
*  You know, it was four.
*  I mean, I guess the world championships, whatever in 2021, which he wasn't very
*  good at, but, um, we just haven't seen him in a while.
*  We haven't seen him at a garden.
*  This is what I did part of my podcast about on Thursday.
*  Like, I don't think people realize like how bad of a defensive player he's been
*  the last few years and how we haven't really been focused on that because that
*  in the playoffs is when you really see it.
*  When people's entire strategy turns into, we got to get Dame on a
*  switch and just torch him.
*  And, you know, whether he's going to be a major liability for them or a
*  minor liability, we'll find out.
*  Um, and then the Phoenix thing, you know, I just don't think they're
*  going to be able to guard anybody either.
*  So maybe this would be a year where offense carries it.
*  Cause at least Denver as good as offensively they were last year, they
*  got stops when it mattered, right?
*  They, in that Laker series, they got big stops in the right time.
*  And you think like Yoke, Edge, Murray, like those guys knew how to
*  defend when they actually had to.
*  And I'm not sure Milwaukee, we'll see.
*  We just haven't seen Dame do it, but who's your favorite?
*  If you had to pick a favorite team right now, who'd you pick?
*  Is it too early?
*  It's too early for me.
*  It just is.
*  Yeah.
*  It's too early for me too.
*  I was doing the start and research yesterday.
*  I was like, Jesus Christ.
*  I mean, the Pacific, the Pacific has Lakers, Clippers, Kings, warriors, sons.
*  Those are just all five teams in the division.
*  I guess the Clippers are the worst team, but I think the league is like
*  insanely loaded this year, like in like kind of a shocking way, just too much talent.
*  Because I'll never forget, you know, when NBA.com does the GM surveys and how much
*  recency bias can play into the whole thing.
*  Yeah.
*  I think it was the off season where, you know, the Celtics added, I don't know.
*  I think it was like, was it Gordon Hayward and.
*  And Kyrie?
*  When it was Kyrie, because Kyrie was 17.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're like, okay, well that's, that's like an incredible hall.
*  And then Oklahoma city had added Carmelo late.
*  Right.
*  And they did that survey right after it.
*  And then the survey was like, Oklahoma city had the best off season.
*  And they were like, if you just separated, like, there's no way
*  anyone would ever say that.
*  So the point that I'm making here is that I don't want to be dismissive of Denver
*  by going like, oh, it's either Milwaukee or Boston.
*  Cause I don't feel that way.
*  I think any of the front offices are trying to do this stuff.
*  It's a short list of teams that can say, we have a real chance.
*  We have a real chance to end up as the team and Milwaukee is it.
*  Uh, Milwaukee is on that list.
*  I should say Boston certainly on it.
*  Clearly Denver is because of Jokic.
*  I think Phoenix in a weird way is being overlooked, but it was so ugly.
*  I just thought that was such a mess of a series against Denver.
*  And maybe that was the most impressive.
*  Phoenix is on that list for, for me.
*  I don't know if defensively they'll be able to pull off four rounds, but I mean,
*  if you look at the Fandl odds, Boston, Milwaukee, Phoenix, Denver, and the
*  Lakers have the top five odds.
*  I'm good with all five and then the Warriors are six.
*  Then I think I'm good with that too.
*  That would be my short list right now.
*  And I wouldn't really have anybody else except the heat.
*  The heat of dropped to 30 to one on Fandl.
*  There's some, you know, okay.
*  I felt like was one trade away from really being interesting, but they just
*  don't seem like they're interested in actually competing this year, but I felt
*  like talent wise, they were like, if you had added drew to everything they had, I
*  really felt like they could have been a top three team in the West, potentially
*  regular season.
*  You haven't mentioned New Orleans too, like on top of everything else.
*  Cause you know, when New Orleans started the season last year, I'm going, they
*  might be the best one through nine, but we know the New Orleans, uh, story's the
*  same one over and over again.
*  But yeah, when I looked at Fandual odds after the Lillard deal, Milwaukee was one.
*  Phoenix was two.
*  Boston was three.
*  I think Denver was four.
*  I think most places, maybe Denver and Boston were the same odds.
*  And now it's Milwaukee and Boston tied and then it's Denver.
*  So I think Denver should be the favorite.
*  I don't think even though they're weaker, they're not that much weaker that they
*  shouldn't be the favorite, but it may be follow up on your point about the West
*  in general, that the odds will be different for Denver just because of how
*  packed it is, deep the West is.
*  Yeah, you're right.
*  Um, for me, what you said earlier about the Yoke-Ich-Murray combo, to me, that's
*  still the, somebody's got to trump that.
*  That was the best thing anyone had last year was when Denver needed a basket,
*  they had those two guys and they were able to create a really good something
*  every time and maybe Damon, Yana, so pull that off.
*  I really liked what the Lakers did.
*  Um, and I think Boston's better than they were last year.
*  You know, I think there's going to be some over the next couple of days, people
*  will point to the four guys they lost and the two guys that got back and they'll
*  be like, they're worse defensively.
*  They're not as good.
*  It wasn't about the defense.
*  And by the way, their defense would collapse at the worst possible times, right.
*  And, uh, in 22 and 23, like their regular season defense was great, but they had
*  some stops issues against really good teams for two straight playoffs.
*  And then big picture was a seven year run for them.
*  Five of them were really good.
*  And I remember doing a thing with you in June.
*  It was like, man, these runs, you never know.
*  All of a sudden it could be over.
*  Like they can't stand path.
*  They got to be aggressive.
*  I would say they were even more aggressive than I ever imagined.
*  Right.
*  But the Drew trade and the poor Zingas trade were fucking ballsy trades.
*  Maybe drew a little less so because you know, it's a little more Turkey, but
*  trading smart for poor Zingas, um, was, was risky.
*  I don't, I don't know.
*  It's really, it's going to be able to play nine months.
*  No, it's, it was a home run.
*  Yeah.
*  And now the lack of depth, it's a big position and you know, we already
*  covered the Horford thing.
*  It's a miracle.
*  They got what they got from them last year.
*  So to expect it again, I don't know about that.
*  And yeah, I kind of, I kind of expect Prozincas to be hurt despite the fact
*  that he had a really good season last year.
*  Let me ask you this.
*  Yeah.
*  Does Milwaukee do all of this over if they know that drew ends up on Boston?
*  Yeah.
*  I think that I think all they cared about was they don't want
*  Yannis to leave and ask out.
*  And they felt like this.
*  Having Dame making life easy, upgrading in whatever way possible and not
*  worrying about what else happens in the league.
*  I think that's what they cared about.
*  And Yannis seemed pretty fired up about it.
*  Did you see the video yesterday of Dame going to Milwaukee and all
*  those people waiting for him in Milwaukee is great fans.
*  They're going to be, if any, uh, if there was any concern about, Oh, he's not in Miami.
*  He's not going to be happy.
*  He's going to be super happy there.
*  They're going to love him.
*  He's going to love playing with Yannis.
*  But now I think they do it anyway.
*  Why do you think they don't?
*  No, we agree.
*  Just want to throw that out there.
*  I think it's exactly, I don't need to add to the answer because
*  you answered it the right way.
*  It was about Yannis.
*  From what I can tell the super tax is $182.8 million and the Celtics are above it.
*  So I don't know.
*  Bobby Marks had an interesting tweet this weekend.
*  It basically said like, when you look at, and with some of the stuff that we talked
*  about, like these new rules and how punitive they're going to be, and that it's basically
*  a different label for a hard cap at the top of this stuff.
*  Mark's entire point was, you know, Boston's going to do this now while they can, because
*  if they try to do this, like they just wouldn't be able to do.
*  And I'd have to like really dig into it the way he did.
*  And, you know, granted I'm in Mississippi watching football, so I wasn't as on top of
*  it as I normally would be, but it's, it's definitely, it makes sense for Boston to go.
*  Look, I mean, I think sometimes we spend all this time on this stuff, but it becomes
*  really simple.
*  Hey, are you better with Drew Holliday?
*  Yeah.
*  Are you better with Drew Holliday?
*  You are.
*  And you'd have to watch, you'd have to live the Rob Williams experience for the highs
*  and the lows and the what the hell's going on with that guy.
*  Like it was constant.
*  It was all the time and the salaries, you know, 11, 12 million the next couple of years.
*  It's a great number for him.
*  Maybe it works out.
*  I still think the pairings about maybe protecting eight and a bit defensively instead
*  of him just replacing him.
*  Twin towers, Samson Olajuwon back.
*  Bring it back.
*  Just block to block baseline screens for each other.
*  I'm going to really enjoy watching this Celtic season.
*  This year you will, you think?
*  I know I'm going to really enjoy this team.
*  I like that.
*  I like that.
*  I'm excited for Jordan Walsh.
*  I'm excited for to know if Joe Maz is a good coach or not once and for all, like
*  they've removed all the excuses for him.
*  They can't say, ah, chemistry and then locker room.
*  And then you had some dark days.
*  We went over his face.
*  You had some dark days in Missoula.
*  And I don't know we're out of the woods.
*  And that's part of the gamble.
*  Like if you're ranking the Celtic gambles, giving up all the draft picks they gave up
*  would be third.
*  Porzingis banking on that dude is second and tripling down on Joe Mazula and trading
*  all the guys that rubbed them the wrong way is number one for me because you better
*  really think you have the right coach.
*  Cause they, they, they greased the skids for him, man.
*  There's no excuses now.
*  If he can't pull this team off, that's on him.
*  This is a really good team.
*  I mean, we have white and holiday.
*  It's one of those teams like you and I, we both talked to these people that work
*  for these other NBA teams and there's just certain guys they love.
*  Like they all love Derek white.
*  Derek white's like the perfect, like, Oh my God, I would love to have Derek
*  white on my team.
*  Even when they traded from them, from the Spurs, you just hear it right.
*  Like, Oh man, I just love that Derek white holiday has been like that since when?
*  Like 2013, 14.
*  He's always been one of those guys that the, the smart kind of whatever basketball
*  people say, Oh man, true.
*  How they love that guy.
*  Um, Jalen Brown, not really as much of a guy like that.
*  I would say, no, but when you, when you, when you talk about, I don't know how
*  often they would play the four, maybe it's specific matchups and really none of this
*  matters until the playoffs.
*  But you know, the thing I like about certain teams that do really well is, well,
*  how many guys do you have that are really comfortable finishing a possession with
*  the ball in their hands?
*  And that's a lot of guys.
*  Well, now they have five.
*  If they play poor Zingas at the end of the games instead of Al with the Tatum
*  Brown and the two guards, all five of those guys can score and wait and holiday
*  are both really good, weird shit just happened in this play.
*  It's complete chaos.
*  Like holiday, the best play of his entire career was that alley up to Yanis, right?
*  Which was one of the crazy, he, he gets the strip and just fucking throws a half
*  court alley up to Yanis to clinch a finals game in Phoenix.
*  Like that play was bonkers.
*  Um, so I don't, I don't know.
*  I think this team's going to be really fun to watch.
*  And I like that combo.
*  Um, all right, we're going to let you go.
*  We're still low.
*  You're doing your podcast tomorrow.
*  Yeah.
*  Tomorrow morning.
*  I'll be back in LA.
*  Is it a farewell to Mac Jones?
*  He's so bad.
*  It's tough.
*  I tweeted today during the game, it not since I was in college, which you're old
*  enough to remember when we had Mark Wilson, we had Tommy Hodson and the
*  humilinator and Steve Grogan with the neck brace.
*  And there was just like this five year run before they got blood.
*  So when it was just bad quarterback play was a lock and I didn't know Mac was.
*  What he did today against Dallas was the darkest QB moment for this
*  franchise since the early nineties.
*  It was that bad.
*  He was, he completely blew the game immediately.
*  And made five terrible decisions that, uh, just submarine them.
*  It was really rough.
*  Hey, at least the organization didn't overpay Brady.
*  Is that what that disaster?
*  The Celtics are in pole position in the city.
*  Like, I don't think they've been in a while because even the bees are kind of,
*  you know, they're seems like they're moving into a different phase of things.
*  The red Sox, holy shit.
*  And then the pats, this is about as bleak as it's looked offensively.
*  So Tatum's like, this is it, man.
*  It's all lined up for him now.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't think there's any disputing that I hadn't really thought about
*  ranking the four teams.
*  You wouldn't, how would you even rank them?
*  I guess the bees would be second.
*  Even cause they, they still have some, some, I feel like the red Sox stuff is nastier.
*  Is this true or not?
*  Do you think red Sox fans are still more mad about Mookie bets than
*  Pat's fans are about Brady?
*  Oh, the Red Sox fans are way madder about Mookie bets.
*  Think about that.
*  I don't think it's even close.
*  They gave them away.
*  It was bad when it happened and now it's like a million times worse.
*  And by the way, the playoffs are about to start and it might feel worse three
*  weeks from now than it does now.
*  So if you're going to games, if you're going to approval rating in the city,
*  then it's Boston, Celtics, easily first.
*  You're right.
*  I don't, let me know when the playoffs start.
*  I don't have a lot of Bruins takes for you.
*  I apologize.
*  They had a nice run and they came really close to winning a second cup and they
*  have nothing to be ashamed of.
*  And they had, you know,
*  Yeah, but last year is disappointing.
*  You're losing the first one.
*  That's, that's hockey.
*  But you know, when you think about, like, I remember just me dipping my toe into
*  hockey, I'm like, they don't have enough lines for all of these guys.
*  This is incredible.
*  And they added these two dudes in the trade deadline.
*  And then, yeah,
*  or two, I was like, this is going to be unbelievable.
*  Like think about all of these options.
*  And I know there was health issues with, uh, with a couple, but yeah, I think by
*  default there are two and, and the Red Sox are probably last in approval ratings.
*  Cause that one just feels nasty.
*  Like if you're Henry, you're going, so you losers couldn't win for eight decades.
*  And now you're mad at us.
*  And it's like, yeah, actually that's the way new England works.
*  Because it's when you're trading guys that have a chance to be in your life for 20
*  years, you know, how many great players are you really going to root for in your
*  entire life?
*  They get to spend their whole careers with them and Mookie would have been one
*  of those guys.
*  So I think that's a much tougher thing to forgive.
*  Like when they, when they lost Fisk and Lynn when I was little, like I never
*  recovered from that watching Fisk on the White Sox for the eighties and, you know,
*  just, just cheaping out on those guys.
*  It was unrecoverable.
*  So yeah, that's, that's for me.
*  Cause that's where the gap will come up.
*  Like I had to be taught those lessons.
*  Right.
*  What happened?
*  What happened, dad?
*  Pop, right.
*  You know, like a kid coming back from the village eons ago, what did they do?
*  Right.
*  What?
*  And so yeah, Mookie man.
*  I mean, for somebody that was at Yazday when I was, uh, I think I was eight, you
*  know, like that was, I went to the Dodgers game.
*  I brought my dad.
*  He'd never been to Dodger stadium and Mookie went off while he was playing
*  second base, like of all things.
*  And then my father was like, let's leave.
*  I went to three Dodger games this year and he played second short and one of
*  the outfield positions of the three games.
*  So I was like, you gotta be kidding me.
*  How did they trade this guy?
