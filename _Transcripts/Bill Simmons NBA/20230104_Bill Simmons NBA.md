# Bill Simmons’s List of the Greatest “What-Ifs” for the Knicks | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [January 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_FDCiuNi6g)
*  Nick's what ifs because them not trading for Mitchell now with how he is ascended
*  in Cleveland.
*  And the big question with him was, what did we watch the last two years in Utah?
*  Do we watch somebody who was just a really good offensive guard who stopped
*  being a two way player?
*  Is this guy a franchise player?
*  Is he almost a franchise player?
*  What is he?
*  When Rossella and I would talk about it last summer, I always defaulted to, we've
*  at least seen him rise to the occasion in playoff series in a way that if he's
*  your best guy, you could at least go toe to toe with the other team's best guy.
*  If he had the right team around him.
*  And that's why we love the Cleveland trade so much because we felt like this
*  guy finally has the right team around him.
*  Well, the Knicks would have been a good team too, because he would have, they
*  basically would have to give up RJ Barrett and some picks.
*  They could have kept Jalen Brunson.
*  You just put him in the RJ Barrett spot.
*  The Knicks are over 500 anyway.
*  I defended the Knicks when that trade didn't happen.
*  I thought they made a really good offer.
*  Thought of RJ Barrett and a couple picks was an awesome offer for Donovan
*  Mitchell and you could argue maybe even a better offer than what
*  Cleveland got back for him.
*  Although marketing has turned out to be, to be pretty great.
*  So we didn't know that last summer, just last summer.
*  I was like, oh, marketing sexting and some first, is that enough?
*  Now marketing has emerged as a probable all-star.
*  Um, but I thought the RJ Barrett and the picks offer was really good.
*  I still don't know totally what happened with Utah and the Knicks.
*  It was a little weird, but now it's turning into a what if, because Mitchell,
*  imagine if he's doing this in New York.
*  Imagine if he did that at MSG last night.
*  Um, imagine if you did that for the star for a title Knicks fans.
*  Um, I think it's a what if.
*  So I went, it made me want to go through the Knicks what ifs.
*  And I had done some of this in my book.
*  I went back, I talked to a couple of people.
*  There's some honorable mention Knicks what ifs.
*  What if Golden State passes on Steph Curry in 2009?
*  It seemed like they were going to take them.
*  They were going to take them or trade the pick to Phoenix.
*  Steve Kerr's talked about that.
*  They didn't expect Curry to drop to seven.
*  He did.
*  And the catch is they had Monte Ellis and I think there was a split second.
*  They were in the Knicks fans like, wait, they have Monte Ellis.
*  They're not going to take Steph Curry too.
*  And that Curry was going to fall to eight.
*  It's an honorable mention.
*  What if I still don't think anyone's passing Curry at seven.
*  It's amazing.
*  Minnesota passed on him twice.
*  The Charles Smith game is another honorable mention.
*  What if it's, it's look, Charles Smith was who he was as a player.
*  There's an angle of those plays where it's, it's pretty physical.
*  They could have called a foul on at least two of those Pippen swipes.
*  And then who knows with that, but again, that's honorable mention.
*  There's honorable mention for Durant in 2016 and Durant in 2019.
*  Just in 2016, didn't even really take a meeting.
*  2019, it seemed like he was headed there and he ends up going to Brooklyn instead.
*  But, you know, they could have been in this whole Durant, Kyrie,
*  whatever you want to call it.
*  I'm trying to be nice because Brooklyn's playing well.
*  And then the other one was there was a Kevin McHale offer sheet.
*  In 1982 is the year the, um, the salary cap changed.
*  And you could do these restricted free agent offers and.
*  They just, the Knicks decided they're going to make this big, it was 1983, my bad.
*  Um, the Knicks decided they're going to make this big offer for Kevin McHale.
*  And Red Arbeck found out about it and made offers to Marvel Webster and Sly
*  Williams and Rory Sparrow before the Knicks officially made the McHale offer.
*  And made it so that the Knicks had to decide, do we want to lose all three of
*  those guys to try to sign Kevin McHale who might not even get anyway?
*  And the Knicks ended up re-signing their three guys, the Celtics, Keith McHale.
*  It's kind of crazy to look back on because they should have just done
*  everything they could to get Kevin McHale.
*  He ended up being like one of the 35 best players of, of all time.
*  And at the time we knew he was really good and Arbeck just outwitted them.
*  But it's an honorable mention.
*  What if?
*  I think if you talk to Knicks fans, especially the ones around the 80s,
*  the McHale offer sheet, and then they all feel like there was a moment where
*  they could add Chris Mullin when Chris Mullin was having problems.
*  There was a, uh, Jared Wilkins for Chris Mullin trade rumor that, uh,
*  that was floating around.
*  And I think that's in the what if class.
*  All right.
*  So the actual what ifs.
*  And these are in no particular order until we get to the last couple.
*  I, to me, a huge what if is what if they don't panic trade for Carmelo
*  before he became a free agent?
*  Cause if you remember, um, for Carmelo is better to get traded then because
*  then he could get an extension with them that had the extra year on it.
*  But the Knicks end up giving up Wilson Chandler, Galanari, Raymond
*  Felton, Mozgoff, and their 2014 first, they get back Carmelo and Billups.
*  They gave up so much.
*  They don't, they don't really matter in the 2011 playoffs is basically
*  just Mello and Billups and Amari.
*  Um, and then they use their amnesty on Billups instead of Amari.
*  So they lose their amnesty in the trade too.
*  They locked down Mello and the team's never really, uh, good enough around them.
*  They signed Tyson Chandler, but, um, I was wondering what would have happened
*  had they just not done anything called Carmelo's bluff and either they don't
*  get them in free agency and they just, they are able to still build around this
*  young team and some cap space or they get Carmelo and get to keep all their
*  young dudes, it's the kind of thing you do when you haven't been good in a
*  while and you panic and I do feel like they panicked a little on that one.
*  So that's one.
*  We're going back to 1965.
*  The Knicks have a choice between Bill Bradley and Rick Berry and Rick
*  Berry, I had when I did my book, I had him as the 25th best player ever.
*  He was the best player on the 1975 Warriors who won the title.
*  He should have won the MVP that year.
*  They decide they're going to take Bill Bradley instead of Rick Berry in the
*  draft and the reason that was interesting was they couldn't get Bill Bradley for
*  two years.
*  He was on a road scholarship going to Oxford and, um, they decided they wanted
*  to wait, Barry was the scoring machine at the university of Miami goes to the
*  warriors and ends up lightening up.
*  They make the finals, I think within two years.
*  Um, I had I been around, had I had my column in the mid sixties, I would have
*  been going nuts that they should have taken Rick Perry.
*  Um, it's also what if for him, because he ends up going there and he ends
*  up signing with the ABA, he has to wait a year for even play.
*  So he loses year, he gets hurt.
*  He basically loses three years of his prime because of injuries and losses.
*  For the Knicks, Barry becomes part of the 70 Knicks and the 73 Knicks, both of
*  whom won titles.
*  So it's a what if in the sense of they might not have won any titles.
*  Here's what I wrote in my book.
*  Barry was the second best passing forward of all time, Pat and Larry Bird.
*  If anyone could have fit in seamlessly with those Knicks teams, it's him.
*  One of two extremes would have played out.
*  Either Barry goes down as one of the 12 greatest players ever in a New York icon,
*  or he goes down as a temperamental annoying asshole whom everyone in New York
*  despised before he finally got driven out of town for eyeballing Will Street
*  after a drop pass, then getting thrown into the 15th road MSG by Willis.
*  It's one or the other.
*  It's hard for me to believe he wouldn't have fit in with those Knicks teams.
*  So as weird as it sounds, even though they win two titles, maybe they win more
*  if they took Rick Barry, or maybe he blows the whole thing up.
*  I don't know.
*  Either way, it's a what if.
*  Bernard King tore his ACL during the year that ended up getting the Knicks,
*  Patrick Ewing.
*  It is a massive what if because he never came back.
*  The craziest stat ever is Bernard King never plays with Patrick Ewing.
*  They play together once in the All-Star game, like six years later.
*  But on paper they have Bernard who was like 34 a game.
*  He gets hurt.
*  They get Ewing out of it.
*  And if we had like modern knee technology, Bernard's back in a year.
*  Instead he's out for like two and a half years, ends up getting mad at the Knicks,
*  leaves, they never play together.
*  And that's a, that, that's a legitimate what if.
*  I would put the Mitchell trade right here, probably under that, because
*  um, if you put Mitchell on this Knicks team, then they're probably a top five
*  team in the East.
*  And then there are also one move away from really being something, because I
*  think Brunson's been better than anyone expected and just upgrading from Barrett,
*  who I like to Mitchell, I think is, is reason enough to think that they'd at
*  least be like a fringe contender, but they'd have the foundation that Brunson
*  that have Mitchell, um, they'd have Randall who they'd have him going again.
*  Caps space potentially.
*  Um, I think it's a pretty good one.
*  Another what if never hiring Isaiah Thomas.
*  They do that in a, I think 2003 his first move is he trades Antonio Mcdice and a
*  bunch of other stuff and two first rounders in Oh four in 2010 to the sons
*  for a Stefan Marbury and Penny Hardaway.
*  Marbury is basically the equivalent of what's going to happen when somebody
*  overpays for Trey young in about a year, just file that one away.
*  Then he trades two unprotected firsts in 2006 and Oh seven, which was a pick
*  swap for Eddie Curry and Antonio Davis and a first rounder and those picks
*  became the Marcus Aldridge and joking Noah.
*  So you just take those two.
*  He, he blew up four first round picks and basically wasted five years of a
*  10 year decade and had a huge sex scandal.
*  And by the time it was over, um, they had to do this two year Odyssey to create
*  enough calf space to get LeBron and Wade, which is our next what if the summer
*  2010 LeBron and Wade and the Knicks fans get tricked.
*  Maybe they tricked themselves into thinking, well, LeBron, he's going to
*  want to come to the biggest city in the world.
*  This is, this is the move as a basketball player.
*  He's got to come here and he's going to bring his buddy, Wade with him or
*  we'll bring Chris Bosh or maybe he'll bring all three.
*  And then I'm going to Miami.
*  They get nothing.
*  They end up spending their calf space on Amara Stoudemire, who was awesome for a
*  year and then his, uh, or less than a year.
*  And then his knee went out on him.
*  But, um, it is crazy that we always thought for years and years, once the
*  Knicks get calf space and they'll be able to get, you know, Duran or LeBron
*  or Wade and they never ever get these guys.
*  So that's that.
*  All right.
*  Last, what if is a big one.
*  It deserves its own little section for the Knicks.
*  So you go back to 1975 and the Knicks have had a decent kind of half
*  decade run at this point, right?
*  Six to nine Knicks were really good.
*  Lost to the Celtics.
*  No shame in that.
*  They win in 70.
*  They win the title again in 73, millions of books written about them.
*  People love those Knicks teams.
*  So if you're saying like, when we get to 1975 and you're a Knicks fan, did this
*  go okay, you would probably point to the, uh, 11 titles Boston won and be like,
*  well, that part sucked, but got some momentum here.
*  We won in 71 and 73.
*  We had this iconic team.
*  Everyone wrote these books about them.
*  Beautiful basketball, the whole thing.
*  So then 1975, it's starting to die down to Bush and Reed.
*  I think both of those guys are gone at that point.
*  Monroe and Frazier is still there.
*  Kareem becomes available.
*  It's he tells the bucks during the 74, 75 season about like, you gotta,
*  you gotta get rid of me.
*  So the next, he wants to go to the next.
*  He's from New York.
*  That's his number one choice.
*  So they started negotiating with the Knicks at the end of that season.
*  They offer the bucks 1.5 million and some draft picks for Kareem.
*  And the bucks GM was Wayne Embry, former Celtic, laughs them off.
*  It's like, no way, not enough.
*  He ends up dealing Kareem to the Lakers.
*  The Lakers had the second and the eighth pick.
*  So he gets both of those.
*  They take Dave Myers, a junior Bridgeman get Brian Winters, who was a good player.
*  He ended, he made two all-star teams.
*  Great beard.
*  Love Brian Winters and Elmore Smith and they get $800,000.
*  So way more than the Knicks could offer.
*  But, uh, the New York times reported that the Knicks, if they had offered $4
*  million, they could have gotten Kareem.
*  That's it.
*  I don't even know if they needed to have picks.
*  Just four million bucks.
*  You can have them and maybe throw in a couple first.
*  Who knows the Knicks were cash poor because they had just spent $2.4 million on
*  George McGuinness, who is an awesome ABA player came to the NBA.
*  Wasn't that good?
*  Here's the problem.
*  George, his draft rights belong to the Philadelphia 76ers.
*  So they get him as a free agent.
*  They commit this money that now they can't spend on Kareem.
*  And then the NBA voids the George McGuinness trade because his
*  rights belong to the Sixers.
*  Not only do they void it, they strip the Knicks of their 1976 number one
*  pick for illegally signing George McGuinness.
*  So you go from could have just spent 4 million on Kareem to now I don't have
*  George McGuinness and I lost my number one pick, which would have been, if you
*  go back either the sixth or the seventh pick, well, Adrian Dainley went sixth.
*  Robert Parrish went eighth.
*  So that kind of sucked.
*  So then on top of it, they panic and they trade for Spencer Haywood, who, um, I
*  wrote a whole thing in my book about the broken mirror.
*  He was bad luck wherever he went.
*  She's bad luck left and right.
*  He was this guy that, um, was supposed to be, you know, one of the great
*  forwards of the seventies had some issues in Seattle, the Knicks end up.
*  Well, we'll get Spencer Haywood.
*  He's a big name.
*  He costs them 1.3 million.
*  He cost them the ninth pick in 1975 that they had to trade.
*  So they go from instead of Kareem, they lose two first round picks and get
*  Spencer Haywood who ends up on three more teams in the next four years.
*  Even worse that leads to a year later, the ABA MBA merger, the nets can't afford Dr.
*  J they have to spend so much money just to get into the league that they know
*  they can't afford Dr.
*  J well, what about the Knicks?
*  The nets owed the Knicks for 10 years when they joined the league, $480,000 per year.
*  So they say to the Knicks, you waive that penalty for us, the territorial
*  penalty, it's 4.8 million over the next 10 years, you waive it.
*  It's done.
*  We'll give you Dr.
*  J, but you waive that penalty.
*  And the next day, no, they're like, wait, the best player in the league, the most
*  exciting NBA player of this decade.
*  And he could be in New York city.
*  Nah, we're gonna pass.
*  So, um, Philly ends up buying them for 3 million.
*  They actually get a discount.
*  So the next thing, maybe they could have gotten a discount.
*  Nope.
*  They didn't care.
*  And this suck for Doc, cause he goes to the Sixers.
*  He's with a bunch of like me first guys, ball hogs and it takes years, even though
*  that those teams were just not that fun to watch for him.
*  He starts having knee issues.
*  Could have gone to the Knicks and just been the guy.
*  So two years later, this gets weirder.
*  Two years later, the nets, they settle the territorial fee by giving the Knicks,
*  the fourth pick in the 78 draft, their number one pick in 1979 for the 13th
*  pick in 78 and a settlement on all the rest of the money.
*  Um, and that leads to the next take Michael Ray Richardson with that pick.
*  They end up eventually traded Michael Ray Richardson, um, for Bernard King.
*  So they get Bernard King out of it.
*  So in a weird way, I wrote my book.
*  They, it led to two wild entertaining Michael Richardson years.
*  One, what the hell is wrong with Michael Ray season?
*  One awesome Bernard season, one, one and a half life altering Bernard years where
*  he was other than Bird, the best player in the league.
*  And then that's it.
*  So not so bad, but man, they could have had Kareem and Dr.
*  Jay, there's no better Knicks what if than that.
*  Um, Donovan Mitchell, pretty good, but not anywhere close to that.
*  So there you go.
*  Those are my next what ifs.
