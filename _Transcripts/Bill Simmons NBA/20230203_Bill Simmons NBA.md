# Bill Simmonsâ€™s NBA Fake Trade Draft | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [February 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFQ5S1aA8oQ)
*  All right.
*  This is the first time we've ever tried this.
*  It is a fake trade draft.
*  We're going to go around the horn, Rob Mahoney, Kevin O'Connor, Chris Ryan.
*  We're going to throw out fake trades.
*  The ground rules are going to be this.
*  So if I, if I make up an OG and an OB trade and Toronto gets back three firsts
*  and you know, the contracts to match that kind of structure is off the table for
*  OG and an OB, if you want to use him another trade, you got to get even more
*  creative.
*  So part of the exercise for this guys is not only to try to make fun fake trades,
*  but also we're basically ranking which trades we like the most.
*  CR, you were the first person I asked to be in this and I don't really know why.
*  I don't know what made me think you were ready to, uh, to establish your fake
*  trade destiny here, but you were, you immediately accepted and you were excited.
*  Yeah, this has never been my forte with you.
*  So I appreciate you always looking for places.
*  It's like a growth opportunity for me.
*  You really, after 11 years, you never cease to stop inspiring me.
*  Yeah.
*  It's, you know, I like to keep testing and testing.
*  KSA you've been in the trade.
*  You've been in a, the trade deadline mode really for a few weeks here.
*  You even started a couple of new cycles with a couple of your fake trades.
*  Are you surprised we haven't had good trades yet?
*  Not too surprised.
*  All indications were this is going to hold, especially like the OG and an OB
*  stuff until next week.
*  So I think next week will be fun, but you know, right now, late, late the week
*  before the deadline, it'll be slow.
*  Well, we're taping this.
*  It is Thursday, one o'clock Pacific time.
*  And we're just going to put the call, put the podcast up right after, uh, we're
*  done because who the hell knows what's going to happen, Rob, what's the biggest
*  surprise to you that hasn't happened yet?
*  Lakers.
*  Yeah.
*  I would have thought the Lakers would have moved on something by now, and
*  especially since we're starting to see with miles Turner getting his extension,
*  you know, that's complicating that situation.
*  They already spent some of their seconds to get Ruri Hachimura.
*  Their options are just changing.
*  And that was a team that has needed things all year that we expected to be
*  buyers all year, and yet I'm sure we're going to talk about them in a lot of
*  scenarios today because they just make sense for a lot of these candidates still.
*  Well, before we, we start the fake trade draft, none of us are Laker fans.
*  If you were a Laker fan objectively, like just, this is your team.
*  You've already traded all of these picks for Anthony Davis.
*  You won a title, but nobody was allowed to go to the games that happened in the
*  bubble, but you really haven't had a chance to enjoy this team.
*  And now you have 38 year old LeBron in year 20, you have Davis who can't stay on
*  the court and you have LeBron pressuring them, you know, internally and externally.
*  We got to do something.
*  This could happen.
*  Is there a Laker trade KOC that would make you think this team could actually win
*  the title?
*  Because to me, I don't see it.
*  Russell Westbrook to future firsts, a second to the Raptors for Fred Van
*  Bleet, Gary Trent Jr.
*  and Otto Porter.
*  Is that the move?
*  So that was the one you, you tackled on your podcast a couple of weeks ago.
*  And I heard that and I just didn't feel like that one than the title, Rob.
*  It was like, that sounds good.
*  That's an interesting team, but I still have a ton of questions and I still think
*  there are multiple teams in the East that would be better than whatever they
*  threw out.
*  What did you think when you heard that?
*  It gets them closer.
*  Like I, and I like the components of that.
*  Like even just the Gary Trent Jr.
*  trade is attractive to the Lakers or for the Lakers for me.
*  But I think there's too much ground to make up.
*  Like the West is the top of the West is so far ahead of them.
*  They have such significant holes still.
*  And most importantly, even if they completed a trade like that, they still
*  have significant holes.
*  Like they still need front court help.
*  They still maybe don't have enough length as far as like traditional threes on
*  the wing.
*  Like it's, they're in a really tough spot with a lot of needs.
*  I don't know that this is the season they close that gap.
*  Yeah.
*  But you have to think about like what their expectations were or are for this
*  season and also what would constitute a successful season for the Lakers.
*  Like I know that everybody talks title town here, but like if LeBron breaks
*  Kareem's record, which he's going to do, and they get a second round playoff exit,
*  it's not a successful season.
*  Isn't that like a head held high season for them?
*  I'd say so.
*  Is that what LeBron wants though?
*  I mean, the whole point of this is he's trying to win a fifth title.
*  I think if he was trying to win that fifth title, he wouldn't assign that deal
*  the way he did.
*  I think he's happy to be in LA.
*  Like that's part of it, Chris.
*  You're right.
*  And I think for them, it's about what's the best, best path forward for getting
*  that title team.
*  Is it making a deal now or is it waiting until the summer when they'll have the
*  ability to trade three future first round draft picks rather than just the two they
*  can right now, because come summertime, they'll be able to trade the 20, 23 that
*  they'll be getting from the Pelican.
*  So it's about the timing of when you make that move.
*  I personally think if Van Vliet and Trent and Porter were to go there with all the
*  depth they'd have at wing, you know, the versatility at guard, if LeBron and 80
*  were healthy is always going to be a big if it's going to be a big if as long as
*  you know, 80s there, I just don't foresee a better deal available over the summer
*  unless, you know, there's going to be a top 30 top 40 player available that we're
*  not thinking about right now.
*  Well, the Laker game plan, right, always is pray for chaos.
*  They are they are the team that always benefits from those situations.
*  They are in any kind of mystery suitor or star that asks out, they are going to be
*  first in line for those conversations.
*  And so that's what's always so tempting about waiting.
*  And that's why I think we've gotten to this point and why they didn't pull the
*  trigger, whether it's on Turner and healed or any number of permutations over the
*  course of the year, it's always going to be tempting for them to try to wait.
*  Yeah, they got their case.
*  One of my things, look at the no, I was going to say they got their cast because
*  look at the Western Conference standings.
*  One of the things with the Lakers, like LeBron the other night, he played the
*  Celtic game, took the Monday night game off and then played the Tuesday night
*  game against the Nets.
*  So what we're seeing is like he's been able to really succeed at, I think, a
*  higher level than any of us expected.
*  But he's also been really careful about when he's picking rest and taking games
*  off and things like that.
*  And you can't do that in the playoffs.
*  Right.
*  We saw what happened to Chris Paul last year with the older player when it's just
*  like that grind, especially when you get into round three, you play every other
*  day.
*  See if that combined with Davis, who's I just, I just don't trust him to be able
*  to play two straight months.
*  If I was a Laker fan, I just wouldn't want to trade the picks.
*  I wouldn't say I would rather wait till this summer and I would consider this
*  season like, look, this is the season we had some bad luck.
*  LeBron got to break the record, but ultimately like, we're not going to win
*  the title.
*  So we're going to be with the entire 2020s.
*  I don't really understand the logic behind it, but it sounds like, you know,
*  enough people who seem to know or have connections to somebody involved, whether
*  it's the Lakers or LeBron, there seems to be this feeling like the promise was
*  made with the extension that, and as part of this, we will do this.
*  And I think that's why he's been so consistent about the pressure.
*  All right.
*  It's time to have some fun.
*  We're going to do the fake trade draft.
*  We're going to go.
*  We're not doing snake draft.
*  We're just going to go in a circle.
*  CR, you go first.
*  Casey, you go second.
*  Robbie, go third.
*  I'll go fourth and we'll go clockwise.
*  Do you want, you want to trade the first pick CR?
*  Yeah.
*  Can I trade the first pick?
*  All right.
*  KOC, you go first.
*  Rob, you go second.
*  I'll go third.
*  CR, you go fourth.
*  What do you got?
*  KSC first pick.
*  All right.
*  I think there might be a strategy to this because you said Bill, you know, start
*  like if it's OG for three first, then you go first.
*  If it's OG for three first, then you have to come back with a more complicated trade.
*  So I might be going with the complicated trade too soon here, but my idea is to
*  save the Phoenix Suns.
*  Aitin and two first round picks in the future to the Raptors for Fred Van Vliet
*  and OG and Anoby and then Jay Crowder and Dario Sarich to the Hawks.
*  Finally, they're able to move John Collins.
*  Wow.
*  I like the layers to that.
*  You just double traded us?
*  Start?
*  Number one?
*  Yes, that's my number one.
*  A freeway deal to save the Phoenix Suns.
*  All right.
*  So Phoenix, they're showing Aitin, they're shelling out Crowder and they're
*  showing out a bunch of picks and the Sarich contract and they're getting back
*  Van Vliet, Collins and Anoby.
*  Wow.
*  That seems like a lot.
*  That that does.
*  Do we think Rob, do we think Aitin has that much trade value?
*  Because I was just working on this trade value column that was going to Marne.
*  I did not put him in my top 70s, spoiler alert, because of 120 million.
*  I think a deal like this to me to hit would have to be a low point in the
*  Fred Van Vliet trade market, right?
*  It's like the Lakers or the Clippers do other things with their point guard
*  position, maybe they just don't want to pony up the picks that the Raptors might
*  want.
*  And so then the Raptors start looking at consolidating their deals and saying like,
*  what is the most aggregate value if Fred Van Vliet is not a part of our future
*  plans and we're a little worried about this logjam at forward and we want to
*  find something to do with OG?
*  That's when deals like this come into play.
*  That's when something like this starts to make sense.
*  I like it because it seems like Deandre Aitin would be the perfect high usage
*  player on a tanking team in Toronto.
*  And it seems like that would just be a really suitable home for him to kind of
*  get his game back together.
*  And you could also see Masai Yuriy being like, I'm betting on this guy.
*  I think that there's more to his game than like living under Chris Paul's thumb.
*  And maybe it's just a coaching and situational problem, not like his own
*  talent.
*  I think you're right on there, Chris.
*  And plus it's important to remember Toronto liked Deandre Aitin during his free
*  agency.
*  They weren't the team that was right there.
*  That was the Indiana Pacers.
*  But now with Indiana resigning Miles Turner for a two year extension, if you're
*  thinking about potential deals, there's been reports over the past month about
*  the sons like Fred Van Vliet this past week out of TSN, the sons like OG and
*  Inobi.
*  So if you're connecting dots there, perhaps there could be something to work out
*  there.
*  Even if, Bill, I agree with you, Aitin's value is diminished considering how
*  poorly he's performed this year after signing that long-term extension.
*  But at the same time, like he's still young.
*  And if you're the rappers, maybe you're betting on him in a brand new situation
*  and getting some draft capital back in return.
*  Maybe you end up getting an extra pick in that, too.
*  But I think that type of concept works in the son's favor because also John Collins,
*  boy, how nice it would be for Phoenix to have somebody who can actually dunk around
*  the basket.
*  It'd be so awesome to have him paired with Chris Paul and Devin Booker rather than
*  with Aitin, who as good as he is, he tries to lay everything up soft around the
*  basket instead of dunking it hard for a guy who's seven feet tall.
*  John Collins reminds me of the TV that five of your friends have been offered by
*  your sixth friend.
*  They're like, you want this TV?
*  We're getting rid of it.
*  And he said, no, no, I'm good, man.
*  And then like too much say, you know, we're still trying to get rid of that TV.
*  Why doesn't he have value?
*  It's like he's makes a little too much money and has a little too much stature to
*  just be given away.
*  But yet nobody wants him.
*  He's been in trade rumors for a year and a half.
*  So what is he overrated, underrated?
*  What is he?
*  I think underrated.
*  Like John Collins is a good NBA player, a versatile defender, as Kevin alluded to,
*  a good finisher, but not only that has some ball skills, can do some things off
*  the bounce.
*  To me, he plugs into a team like Phoenix really easily.
*  That's a team that needs a little more dynamism, that needs a little more spice
*  to what they do.
*  And so, you know, the thought of we're just going to roll out in the past, Jay
*  Crowder, now Cam Johnson in that fourth spot.
*  Like I want someone who can do even a little bit more than that.
*  I want someone who's more of a downhill threat than that.
*  Collins makes all the sense in the world in that capacity.
*  And even though he hasn't shot the ball well this year for the Hawks behind the
*  arc in the past, he's been a steady three point shirt and defensively he's become
*  somebody who, when he entered the league, was more of a liability, slow footed.
*  But I mean, he's had so many plays this year.
*  Like I remember against the Dallas Mavericks, maybe a couple of weeks ago
*  where he had this great help just to use the rule of verticality to help on a
*  drive by Bullock late in the game.
*  Final minute that helped, you know, create an opportunity for the Hawks to score.
*  He's had countless moments like that this year where it's like, I almost don't
*  understand how he hasn't been moved.
*  I really do think it's a money thing that you alluded to there, Bill, because he
*  makes over 20 million.
*  Maybe he's not quite that good, but for a team like the Suns where you're all the
*  way in, he makes all the sense in the world.
*  So I have a draft.
*  He reminds me of some of the guys.
*  Oh, hold on.
*  He reminds me of some of the guys CR and I in the early 2000s.
*  When we were in the early digital, we were out there.
*  It's like the last of us just fighting the zombies, trying to get columns and
*  blogs up, but we, there are all those forwards back then, right?
*  Like, uh, Juwan Howard, Sharif, Antoine, these guys, these expensive forwards.
*  And it's like, eh, this guy's definitely good, but that's a lot of money.
*  And, and they would just kind of move teams and move around Keith Van Horn.
*  And funnily enough, they all wound up playing for the Hawks at various sports.
*  Right.
*  Cause there was that era of the Hawks where every dude on the Hawks was six, eight.
*  And it was just like, you couldn't play.
*  You couldn't be taller than that.
*  You couldn't be shorter than that.
*  If you wanted to play with Joe Johnson, you had to be six, eight.
*  Rob, before you go, I have a quick Fred Van Vliet question.
*  Are we sure he should be worth that much?
*  He's an ex he's going to definitely become a free agent this summer.
*  He just hired clutch clearly wants a big paycheck.
*  And I got to be honest, I don't think he's played that well this year.
*  When I watched the Raptors, I, I don't, I think we in our heads, because he's
*  been in a lot of big playoff games and there's this sense like, Oh, Fred Van
*  Vliet, you know, he's been there.
*  He's been through some wars, but like, I don't know.
*  I mean, is he ever, how many times in a game when you're watching like them
*  against any other team is the other point guard better than him?
*  Is he one of the 10 best point guards in the league?
*  Probably not.
*  Right.
*  You go, anybody they play, it's like, there's always a guard who seems to be
*  better than him.
*  So he's like, good.
*  And he's fine.
*  And in that Laker situation, he'd be fine, but I don't think he's like a top
*  three guy on a contending team.
*  And I think that's one of the problems with the team that they built.
*  There are eight games under 500 partially because he is the ball a lot.
*  Yeah.
*  I think ideally he wouldn't be a top three guy on a, on a championship team or
*  a contending team at this point.
*  But the reality of teams like the Lakers is he would have to try.
*  Like he needs to at least like try to flex up a little bit from
*  where he's been this season.
*  You're right.
*  It's been a bad year for Fred Van Vliet.
*  It's been a bad year for Fred Van Vliet fans, like myself, like I love watching
*  him play, but the shot hasn't been there.
*  And that's even with an uptick in this calendar year, like he's been playing
*  better and he's still under 40% from the year for field goal shooting.
*  So it's, it's a hard spot for him, but I would say in terms of this construction,
*  I'm not sure that they are getting that much for him.
*  I'm not sure that the sons are giving up that much in this kind of deal.
*  Cause if you have OG and Van Vliet coming back and Collins, and all you're
*  giving up is eight and two firsts as like the core of that deal that I mean,
*  that's, that's selling, selling low on Fred probably.
*  That's a pretty good one for the sons.
*  The two things that I found the most challenging aspects of this exercise
*  bill is a what the go baron Murray trades did to value in terms of like
*  draft picks going back, like I have no idea how many draft picks are supposed
*  to go for somebody like Pascal Siakam or OG and Adobe.
*  And the other thing is that I feel like the Toronto Raptors guys have all been
*  in trade rumors for so long that like, I don't even believe they actually play.
*  I just think that they exist as dudes where it's just like, Hey, everybody's
*  talking about this and the size is going to blow it up this year.
*  And I feel like I've been living this day for the last four years where it's
*  like, we're waiting for the Messiah rebuild and these guys have all almost
*  grown beyond their actual, their reputations have grown beyond their actual
*  play because there's their quote unquote available.
*  Do you know what I mean?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, especially the go bear trade.
*  It reminds me of, you know, we live in all of us live in California or three of us
*  live in California, um, when gas is just like $7 again, you're like, wait, why is
*  gas $7 again?
*  It's like, nah, it just is.
*  And then it'll go down and it'll be like, now it's $5.
*  It's like, why did it go down?
*  Don't know.
*  The go bear, the go baron Murray things where it's like, Nope, that's the price
*  now three unprotected first and two pick swaps.
*  It's like, is it, or is this just like a weird gas thing where it's like, maybe
*  that actually shouldn't be the price.
*  Maybe gas should be a bunch lower.
*  All right.
*  We're on a hoatious pace in our fake trade NBA draft.
*  We've had one pick.
*  We're at this 20 minute mark of the podcast.
*  Rob, what do you got for us?
*  Uh, first question, what is off the board?
*  Like Kevin, Kevin made that pick.
*  What can't I pick at this point?
*  You can, why don't you go and then we'll tell you, I mean, that three, three
*  team was so complicated.
*  I think everything's on the board right now.
*  Okay.
*  Well, I'm, I'm going to go real simple.
*  I, you know, I want to take some reaches later in the draft.
*  So I'm going chalk up top OGN and OB to the Grizzlies.
*  It's the, it's the example for a reason, right?
*  Like this is a trade that I think a lot of basketball fans would love to see.
*  She's like, what the Grizz look like with a wing like that, with a player like that.
*  Sending out, you know, basically three firsts and Zaire Williams is the core of
*  that deal, Danny green salary to make it work.
*  That's a deal I would love to see.
*  And one that, you know, for the purposes of this draft, I think has to go pretty
*  early, it just, it makes a lot of logical sense.
*  Kristen, I felt like wimpa that's the wimpa yama of this draft that trade.
*  Yeah.
*  I had that at the top of my board too.
*  It's like, I just, I want that trade to happen.
*  It's everybody wants everybody.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think also like, do you guys feel like this?
*  I wanted to ask about this new Orleans collapse, obviously without Zion, but
*  this, you know, they've lost nine in a row.
*  Has it taken them out of the buyer's market?
*  I wouldn't quite call them sellers, but everybody was talking about how the
*  Pelicans and the Grizzlies were the two most likely homes for Anadoby.
*  And like, that was like the competition for these guys.
*  What, what does it do to this?
*  You know, is Memphis bidding against nobody then in this case?
*  No, cause it's, they're bidding against the sons.
*  Cause I think the sons could just do the cam Johnson, Sarich and the three
*  day sons have all their firsts.
*  They have a new owner.
*  We know what happens with new owners.
*  They want to come in.
*  They want to make their big splash.
*  Show their put where their tank top show their chest hair a little bit.
*  So I feel like it's the sons and I agree with you.
*  I don't, I don't think new Orleans, they've fallen so far back.
*  And then you read like Zion's going to be reevaluated in a couple of days,
*  like reevaluated that sounds like he's not coming back until March.
*  So I don't know what they are.
*  What have you heard, KFC?
*  I mean, there, there was a conversation between Mark Stein and Chris Haynes
*  today on their podcast about how the Pelicans and Grizzlies are bidding
*  against each other or could turn into that, you know, the Grizzlies don't
*  want the Pelicans to get them and the Pelicans don't want the Grizzlies to
*  get them.
*  Um, and I think with new Orleans, yeah, granted they've fallen apart.
*  It's been because they don't have their two best players.
*  Zion's been out.
*  Brendan Ingram was just getting back and he's not the same quite yet.
*  He's working his way back.
*  I mean, any team's going to suck without those caliber players to top 20 guys.
*  Zion was performing like a top 10 guy.
*  So I think in the case of new Orleans, yes, it's worrisome that, you know,
*  Zion is just going to be reevaluated in a couple of days, Bill, like you said.
*  But at the same time, if you're new Orleans and you're getting OG and an OB
*  who's in his mid twenties for, you know, three of your 15 future first round
*  draft picks, it's not just about this season.
*  It's about the next five years of building out a team that you feel
*  confident can win around OG and an OB went around Zion Williamson and
*  Brendan Ingram with OG.
*  Rob, I'm raising my hand.
*  What you got?
*  Am I crazy to think new Orleans does need OG and an OB at all?
*  It's like the last thing they need.
*  They're loaded with three and D guys.
*  And I like her Jones.
*  I like trade Murphy.
*  I think you have to think like, all right, I'm playing in an OB Ingram
*  and Zion together, I still need a center.
*  I don't like their point guards.
*  Like that, like Jose Alvarado is involved a lot.
*  If I'm trying to trade my assets for something, I actually like my three and
*  D guys, I would rather try to get a guard that could, uh, that, that was like
*  a 40% three point shooter, like a better version of what van Vlietsezen
*  has been this year.
*  What do you think of that?
*  That's the question is who is the better version of van Vlietsezen, right?
*  Like CJ McCollum is kind of that player.
*  You have him already.
*  Get going.
*  I didn't even mention CJ in that, that thing I just said.
*  So yeah, so it would be CJ, and an OB Zion Ingram in a center.
*  I'm winning a title with that.
*  I don't know if that lineup doesn't make sense to me.
*  So this is my problem with the Pelicans is they have a lot of really good players.
*  I've watched them a lot this season.
*  They've obviously had guys in and out with injury.
*  I have zero sense of what that team actually needs.
*  Like there are nights where they need shooting their nights when they really
*  don't, their nights where they get beat up inside their nights where they look
*  just fine and Val and Tunis looks like a monster.
*  Like I have, I have such a poor read on that team in terms of like those
*  specific kinds of mechanics.
*  And so much of that comes back to Ingram and Zion and just like how little we've
*  seen of those guys on the floor together until they play more, it's hard to
*  definitively like push your chips in and say like, okay, OG is our guy.
*  Or this trade candidate, multiple picks.
*  Like how do you make that call when you've barely seen your team play?
*  Yeah.
*  But they have 13 future first.
*  If you get a three for OG and Innova, you still have 10 remaining.
*  And that's a fair point.
*  Yeah.
*  They could just blow the market out.
*  Couldn't they?
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But doesn't Herb Jones have to be in that trade?
*  He has to be.
*  Maybe.
*  What am I getting OG and Innova for?
*  But I'm keeping Herb Jones and Trey Murphy.
*  Like that doesn't make sense to me.
*  And if I'm Toronto, I'm telling them he has to be in the, I have
*  to get Herb Jones back.
*  He has to be in it.
*  Maybe you do that.
*  And I want three firsts and whatever.
*  You might do it.
*  Now we're talking, if I'm Toronto, if like I can get Herb Jones back and
*  some picks and maybe one other piece.
*  I mean, Dyson Daniels is another one.
*  What is he?
*  Like they, they're so loaded at that spot.
*  I, the real issue for them is CJ McCollum.
*  It's a little like the Fred VanVleet thing.
*  CJ McCollum hasn't played well this year.
*  He's being paid as a guy who is like an all-star scoring two guard.
*  And I just don't think he's totally gotten there.
*  Um, I agree with Rob.
*  I would rather wait to see Zion and Ingram playing together.
*  What that looks like before I decide what to do.
*  Chris, you're on the board or you want me to go?
*  You wait.
*  Do you want me to go and you'll go forth?
*  Yeah, go ahead.
*  Oh, I really liked this one.
*  It's a three teamer guys.
*  Sacramento, Detroit and Cleveland.
*  Cleveland gets Harrison Barnes.
*  Detroit gets Keris LaVert and an unprotected Sacramento first.
*  I know they owe one Atlanta for the herder trade.
*  So we'll figure out what year that is.
*  And the Kings get Bogdanovich from Detroit.
*  And I like this trade because this is the old, this is the old theory of when
*  you have a strength, double down on your strength.
*  The King's strength is offense.
*  They score the fucking shit out of the ball.
*  They're really good.
*  They're really hard to play.
*  They're explosive.
*  Barnes is, you know, he's, he's fine.
*  I think I know he's a valuable clubhouse guy to them, but you would
*  not call him an explosive score.
*  He's he's, he's what he is.
*  He's 13 and six.
*  If I put Bogdanovich in there at every point in the game, I have offense.
*  I have shooters.
*  If you figure sub bonus is playing two thirds of the game, I have speed.
*  I have speed.
*  I have speed.
*  Now I could like maybe sneak out of the West as crazy as it sounds, because
*  the West is wide fucking open and everybody can beat everybody.
*  And maybe I could just get hot for a couple of series, but if I'm them, I
*  would look to upgrade Barnes to Bogdanovich.
*  So that's my case.
*  What do you think KFC?
*  I think you might be giving up too much defense in that case.
*  I mean, Bogdanovich is by no means a liability.
*  He's solid on defense, good positionally, but Harris is a good
*  defense player, he's a good defense player.
*  But Harrison Barnes is also like shooting the hell out of the ball since
*  December, after a slow start.
*  He still offers some offensive punch for you, or maybe what you trust them.
*  I trust them.
*  Yeah.
*  Trust them in a game five.
*  Yeah, I've trusted them since he was in golden state.
*  It's been a long time, including in the postseason where Barnes
*  has been a solid player.
*  Game seven of the 2000.
*  Sorry.
*  Well, I'll get that tape after.
*  Christmas, KFC.
*  I'll watch it after we record.
*  Yeah.
*  Rob, what do you think of the theory of doubling down on your strength?
*  I'm for it.
*  I guess my question is if I'm Cleveland, why wouldn't I just make this trade and
*  get Boyan Bogdanovich myself?
*  Like why wouldn't I do Karis LaVert and I think they would have any picks.
*  I mean, they're, they're a little leveraged pick wise.
*  That would be the difficulties like coming up with the draft capital for that.
*  But if there's any way to do that, I mean, I would prefer that from
*  Cleveland's perspective.
*  If you, if you're going to do that, you're going to have to do it.
*  If you, if you're Cleveland, would you rather get Jay Crowder than Harrison
*  Barnes?
*  Could that be like an option too?
*  Cause I've, I've heard Crowder is kind of a sleeper option for Cleveland.
*  Really?
*  I want to start a new podcast called NBA amnesia where people come on who have
*  just forgotten things that have happened.
*  Like Jay Crowder was bad in the playoffs last year.
*  He was like one of the reasons the Suns fell short and he didn't really do a
*  good job in any round.
*  And people like, no, Jay Crowder, the missing piece.
*  It's like, cool.
*  So he went away for six months and kind of threw everyone off the scent of that.
*  He didn't look good in the playoffs, which is why he wasn't getting any extension.
*  He's always been so streaky as a shooter.
*  I'd rather have Barnes just to be clear than Crowder.
*  But I do think it's a question worth, worth asking from the Cleveland
*  perspective, like, would you rather have the more expensive Barnes or would you
*  rather get Crowder who's, you know, probably discounted it won't cost as much.
*  Oh, I have a couple more Cleveland trades.
*  I think we all see the same thing with Cleveland.
*  They need the three guys.
*  People are just like, cool.
*  Who are you leaving in the corner?
*  We're going to leave that guy open.
*  We're good.
*  We're good.
*  Where about all your other dudes?
*  I wish it were more complicated than that.
*  Like I wish we'd been talking about that all season, you know, and we'd love to
*  see some, some resolution at that position.
*  The Miami game Tuesday night, Moby was awesome in that game, but there was a big,
*  it must've been like a minute and a half left and he was just open in the corner
*  for three and he kind of had to take it the way the defense was and the shot clock.
*  And it was a, it was an absolute brick, but over and over again, it feels like
*  it there's their games come down to these two or three possessions.
*  I think talent wise, I'm a full believer in that team, but that one
*  spot's just murdering them.
*  Uh, see how you're in the clock.
*  Let's go.
*  All right.
*  I think I'm going to go D'Angelo Russell to the Clippers for Cunard and Covington.
*  Whoa.
*  I feel like the Clippers needs to shake up that, that log jam of pretty average
*  dudes that they have going all the way down the end of their bench.
*  When you go see the Clippers live, you have actually no feel whatsoever for
*  what the rotation is and I can never tell like, Oh, is this guy just getting DNP
*  tonight?
*  Oh, wait a second.
*  He's playing the second half.
*  It's like all this sort of random stuff.
*  I know Ty lose juggling because he's got the load management all-stars, but
*  D'Angelo Russell seems to have run out of runway in Minnesota.
*  I think that they have, they, they did Carl Towns the solid by bringing him in.
*  The Clippers could use a point guard.
*  I don't know that John Waller, Reggie Jackson are really it.
*  I don't think that D'Angelo Russell slows down Paul George and Kawhi Leonard, who
*  to me are not particularly light and fast players in the first place.
*  And I think D'Angelo Russell spiritually is a Clipper.
*  So I'd like to see it happen.
*  He's actually been pretty good the last six weeks for Minnesota.
*  It's been, it's a classic contract run.
*  You got to be careful of it.
*  But, um, Rob, I'm like a huge Luke Cunard fan and I actually just think he's on
*  the wrong team and I'd be trying to trade for him, but I, as weird as this
*  sounds, I think I'd rather have Cunard than D'Angelo Russell.
*  Where do you stand on this?
*  Whoa.
*  I mean, I, I'm also pretty bullish on the season he's had, especially from
*  Minnesota's perspective, not only they get Cunard, but Covington, who I think
*  could, you know, punch up some holes for them and give them all just like an
*  alternative look, you know, when Torrey and Prince isn't hitting or like, isn't
*  really working for you on a given night or Kyle Anderson is getting left in the
*  corner and you need like a little bit more of a threat.
*  I like what Covington could give to them.
*  But Cunard's playmaking has been really impressive.
*  Like he's made significant strides in terms of his ability to create space,
*  create his own shot, create shots for others.
*  I don't know about like a lead point guard on a team that's trying to make the
*  playoffs, that's where it gets tough.
*  And so Minnesota has to figure out something else to do.
*  But I'm, I mean, I like him for a lot of teams.
*  He could plug in and play and fit in almost any kind of system.
*  Yeah, I like that trade, CR.
*  He's rhythm guitar to Anthony Edwards lead guitar.
*  Yeah.
*  Is the way I'm thinking of it.
*  It's just like, we don't have two guys playing solos.
*  You're, you know, go ahead, Jimi Hendrix, you play.
*  I don't think you're the tiebreaker.
*  What do you got?
*  I don't think it's a good deal for Minnesota.
*  D-Lo has been playing too well since early December.
*  It was like a really bad start for him if he fit with Ant and maybe it does go
*  sour, but he's D-Lo has been nearly 50, 40, 90 since early December.
*  He's complimenting Anthony Edwards, willingly playing off ball more often
*  with Edwards taking more responsibility on the ball.
*  So I think there's a deal to look for, for Minnesota involving D-Angelo Russell
*  because it's not a perfect fit.
*  And he still has some real duds that are frustrating like that one, the other
*  night against Sacramento, but at the same time, like I think they lose too much
*  at guard without having, you know, a third team involved there, getting one back
*  or a guarantee of somebody who's going to fill that role next to Anthony Edwards.
*  Cause as great as Ant also has been around the same timeline since early
*  December, he still also has room to grow as a lead playmaker too.
*  So I think the concept makes sense finding that, that versatile wing, you
*  know, a shooting guard like Kennard, but I don't like the pieces they get back in it.
*  I'm not a Russell fan, so I like the deal for Minnesota.
*  Interesting.
*  Good one.
*  Some good bait on that one, CR.
*  Great job.
*  I didn't get the KOC vote.
*  That's a good job by you.
*  Came up huge.
*  This is huge, Jim.
*  Tony Robos hitters.
*  All right.
*  KOC you're up.
*  All right.
*  Let's go with the Knicks and the Bulls.
*  Oh, Zach Levine to the Knicks for two, 20, 23, first round picks, a future
*  firsts, Bobby Toppin, the Evan Fournier contracts and Derek Rose homecoming
*  for D Rose going to Chicago, retain enough picks after giving up a handful
*  here to set up for another move this summer.
*  And they get Zach Levine who's got MSG is going to love.
*  Dolan's going to be all about it.
*  Not going to be banning any fans because he wants everybody to come to watch
*  Levine and Brunson in that back court.
*  Then make a flip RJ Barrett this summer for Carl Anthony Towns.
*  Wow.
*  I like the parlay there.
*  Yeah.
*  Lot to work with on that one.
*  So I'll ask you this.
*  So Tibbs isn't playing RJ Barrett in a lot of these crunch times.
*  How do you think he's going to feel about Zach Levine's defense?
*  Not good.
*  I don't think this feels good about anything, to be honest with you, though.
*  Bill, what does this feel good about?
*  Are we sure Tibbs is a good coach anymore?
*  I respect the hell out of the guy, but for the way basketball is played in
*  2023, would he be one of your first choices to coach your NBA team?
*  Isn't the better question is how is Zach Levine's knee going to feel about playing
*  for Tibbs?
*  Right.
*  Again?
*  No, no, I thought we were free.
*  I will say I like what some of the stuff that Knicks have.
*  Like I, I, I had three of them in the trade value at the top 70.
*  I like Barrett.
*  I like Brunson and Randall spent good this year.
*  So what were you saying, Rob?
*  I actually was working on a story on Zach Levine the last time he played for
*  Tibbs and he was having a pretty good season at that time.
*  But I, one quote that will always stick out to me is him saying, I asked him
*  about his off ball defense and he said, it's literally the hardest thing in the
*  world to play for.
*  And he said, it's literally the hardest thing in the world.
*  And I was like, this is not going to go great here.
*  You know, this, this may not be what Tom Thibodeau wants to hear.
*  Wow.
*  I, I don't think the price for Levine is that high KSC.
*  Although I guess they're making them take Fournier's contract back.
*  So you got to factor that piece in.
*  That was part of it with like adding the additional firsts, but I just felt like
*  how many, like honestly, how many Levine suitors are there going to be at this
*  point when it's 250 million for five years and a guy who's had two surgeries on
*  the same knee and until really like mid December didn't really start to look like
*  himself.
*  I'd be really nervous trading for that contract.
*  I, I, and if I'm trading for it, I wouldn't want to give up a ton.
*  That's why I feel like they're going to be stuck with him.
*  DeRozan is the one that, you know, he's at 27 million this year and next year
*  for the playoff proven guy.
*  And it feels like he would have maybe more suitors, but, uh, I like, listen,
*  the Nick's doing anything would be super fun.
*  The Nick's trading for a guy who's already had two knee surgeries.
*  It's almost like the league should step in and ban it from happening.
*  So you can't, you guys can't do this.
*  You've had too much bad luck over the years.
*  Not allowed.
*  Rob, what do you got?
*  I'm going to go off the board a little bit.
*  Uh, Alex Caruso to the Warriors for James Wiseman.
*  Oh, I had this one.
*  That's great.
*  I like it.
*  I'm, I'm big on the like, let's see how we can improve the Warriors at the
*  expense of honestly, and frankly, like any of their young guys at this point,
*  like that team so desperately needs help.
*  And if there's a, if there's a taker for Wiseman on the board, a team that could
*  invest in him and his future and be able to really see what he can do, it would
*  be a team like Chicago and Golden States getting something they really need, which
*  is just honestly another player they can actually trust to put in these games.
*  And Caruso would be so great for the way they play.
*  Can we go Wiseman round Robin right now?
*  Because the possibilities you could tell me Kelly Olynyk for Wiseman, which
*  would make sense for Utah.
*  You could tell me Wiseman with Moody for Kuzma.
*  What do we think?
*  What do we think the Warriors actually need KFC?
*  Cause I, to me, Caruso has always made the most sense, but is there another
*  type of player that I'm missing?
*  Probably more than Caruso, which is probably the wrong way of thinking about
*  it, cause I love the Caruso idea.
*  Like that makes total sense for them.
*  Um, but it seems like for Golden State, they wouldn't want to sell on a former
*  number two pick for Alex Caruso.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a bad way to think about it.
*  So many people in sports in real life and business have made the mistake of
*  thinking like, well, I paid that or I, that's what it costs three years ago.
*  So that's what it is now.
*  And it's like, you know what?
*  Shit changes.
*  And that was a really weird draft.
*  Nobody was allowed to interview anybody.
*  Nobody was allowed to, um, nobody's going to hold this against you for the rest of
*  your lives that you turned the number two pick and Alex Caruso is a weird draft.
*  Desmond Bade went 30th in that draft.
*  Um, they have a chance to win the title.
*  They need another guy.
*  And whether it's Caruso, whether it's Kuzma, Kelly Olynyk, Kuzma, I was
*  intrigued by it because he could play two different forward spots for them.
*  They go a little bigger, a little smaller with him.
*  But I just think I want to see Caruso in a playoff series.
*  And I don't think Golden State would be the only team that should be kicking the
*  tires on it.
*  I think Phoenix should be involved and Milwaukee, basically any contender.
*  He could play 30 minutes.
*  Um, see our, Oh, go ahead.
*  Is Wiseman even enough for Caruso?
*  That's a fair question.
*  That's a, that's a, how do we see ourselves question, right?
*  So it's like, if Chicago is like, we're, we're doing a soft tear down here is
*  embedding on, on a C a higher ceiling for a second overall pick who could be your
*  center of the future.
*  And then maybe get off Vuch eventually.
*  Like that, that seems like for Chicago, I would do it.
*  Yeah.
*  It feels like if you're doing Caruso, then you also have to start sending some
*  other guys out and Vucovich is the, I was trying like how to figure out how to
*  get him to Golden State.
*  He would be the most fun warrior possible.
*  Um, but there's just no way Golden States in that weird, the Celtics were in this
*  situation a few years ago where they either have giant contracts or small
*  contracts and they don't have the contracts that can get you to like the
*  $22 million guy, but they can get, you know, if it's much bigger, they can do it.
*  Um, that'd be really fun.
*  I'm sure, uh, I'm sure Steve Kerr would be delighted to have Alex Caruso.
*  All right.
*  This one's for CR.
*  Bradley Beale for Tobias Harris and Tyrese Maxey.
*  Let's fucking call it in.
*  Let's go.
*  Brad's got to call it in, right?
*  Brad, that Joel Embiid calls him.
*  Sweet talks them a little bit.
*  Hey man, we're 24 in our last 24.
*  We add you, we're going to win the title.
*  Come on over.
*  It's Philly.
*  It's right down the street from Washington.
*  It's our, our Amtrak.
*  Two hours.
*  How long?
*  It's our, our Amtrak two hours.
*  How long is Philly to Washington?
*  Oh, it's like 90 minutes, two hours.
*  Yeah.
*  Would you give up Maxey and Tobias Harris for Bradley Beale, Chris?
*  Oh man.
*  Really?
*  Jesus.
*  I haven't seen you this upset.
*  If you would ask me two months ago, yeah, but I, I, I just like the
*  way they're playing right now.
*  I don't know that they can win the title as currently constituted.
*  And I have a bad feeling that they're going to make some skirt under the
*  luxury tax move at the deadline here.
*  But I kind of want to see this team in the playoffs.
*  KFC.
*  I mean, you got to retain some future upside there.
*  If you're Philadelphia, that's what I'm saying.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, Maxey can get even better.
*  I mean, that's tough.
*  Beale's undeniably better right now.
*  Like it makes you better today.
*  It makes you better.
*  Come playoff time.
*  Maybe does it.
*  Are we sure about that?
*  Like Harris is like overpaid, but he's not necessarily like a negative
*  player overall, so he's been, and he's been great over this 10 in one run
*  that they've just had is just been like, I run right to the foul line and I'd
*  take the shot.
*  I feel like it raises your ceiling, but also maybe lowers your floor a bit too.
*  Yeah.
*  Not, not to mention the health concerns like meals, long-term health, when you
*  already have Joel and, and at this stage of his career, James Harden on your
*  roster.
*  I honestly, this is such a strange place to be after our whole journey with
*  Tobias Harris as a sixer.
*  I think he's pretty important for them.
*  Like I think, I think he feels like a really essential role.
*  I think he is hard to replace.
*  I think at his size, he's giving you a dimension to that kind of three and D
*  and also a guy who can create and do a little something off your second unit
*  too, in terms of generating offense.
*  Guys like that are either expensive or old and washed up or hard to come by.
*  Like I, I can't believe I'm saying it, but in addition to not wanting to give up
*  Maxi, I don't want to give it to bias Harris either at this point.
*  Whoa.
*  Okay.
*  Jesus.
*  Wow.
*  Would you do it if you were, if you were me, Bill, like if you were a
*  Philly fan, would you want that?
*  I actually wouldn't.
*  I thought it was a really fun trade on paper and we'd all go nuts if it happened,
*  but Bill's contract makes me, it's just too much money for me.
*  And I had a, I had a, I had a, I had a, I had a, I had a, I had a, I had a, I
*  had Maxi ranked higher in the trade value list and Beal.
*  So then you're throwing in whatever, but I think from a Philly standpoint,
*  Hardin can pull a hammy tomorrow, you know, and, and you always have this,
*  how many more years are we going to waste from Joel?
*  And I'm sure Joel is like, let's go all in, but maybe not with a trade like this.
*  It's a really fun one though.
*  All right, see what he got.
*  Uh, I'm just going to do something pretty, pretty easy here for the Sixers,
*  which is, uh, the Thible, which has been getting talked about a lot.
*  Basically it's Thible, Corkmaz, and House going to the Kings for Rashaun Holmes.
*  Um, you know, it'd be bringing Rashaun home.
*  He becomes the backup five that they need.
*  It cannot be Montrez Harrell in the playoffs.
*  And, uh, is this a coming home video when he comes back?
*  Did they play that in the first quarter?
*  They definitely do.
*  They keep that tape with the Harrison Barnes, became six games, seven days,
*  but this just helps.
*  It kind of helps both teams ultimately.
*  I'm still a Thible believer, but Doc Rivers is not.
*  He plays seven to 10 minutes, sometimes 12 minutes per game.
*  He gives Sacramento the perimeter defensive strength that they need.
*  I worry that it essentially makes the Sixers Swiss cheese, uh, go on the
*  perimeter, like you don't get any steel on the perimeter if you're the Sixers,
*  but we definitely need a backup five for Joel, even if he's playing like 38,
*  39 minutes in the playoffs.
*  And I just don't, I just, you can't, I cannot watch Montrez in the, in the
*  playoffs.
*  What do you think, Casey?
*  I think it's a good concept.
*  Uh, you have my wheels turning Chris for like a similar concept.
*  I like, I wonder if there's ways to get a wing back, you know, if you're, if
*  you're Phoenix, would you flip Crowder?
*  Like if you get something back in there, like, is there another big out there
*  instead of Rashaun Holmes?
*  I'm sure.
*  Yeah.
*  And then I, you also wonder whether or not, like, would any bigs hit the market
*  in the buyout market?
*  Cause typically, typically those guys become available.
*  I just don't know if there will be anybody better than Harold, which is
*  really scared to contemplate.
*  Rob, are you a type of guy?
*  In small doses.
*  I think I'm, you know, I'm probably closer to Doc Rivers.
*  Yeah.
*  The offense is just killer.
*  Like he, he, he murders the flow of possession sometimes, which is really
*  tough, but like exemplary defender.
*  And I will say can move off the ball really well.
*  And the Sixers are not the ideal style for that, but you put him
*  alongside to bonus and you have him moving in that flow of how Sacramento.
*  He cuts really well.
*  He's, he's really good along the baseline.
*  You can see how that would work.
*  Like you can, you can see the shape of how he could mean something more for
*  them than he ever could for the Sixers.
*  Rob, I'll buy your table stock after the podcast.
*  Okay.
*  Feel free.
*  We'll, we'll cut a deal.
*  I'm buying up all the table stock.
*  He's going to have a moment.
*  He's too good defensively.
*  When somebody is that skill, that one of the most important NBA things, it
*  usually works out for that person in the end.
*  And I just think he's on the wrong team.
*  Putting him on a team where it's either you dump the ball to and beat or harder
*  dribbles for 20 seconds, like this is not what I want to see him at night.
*  Sacramento would be really fun.
*  I think he would be interesting on that thing.
*  KOC you're up.
*  I'm going to, I'm going to kind of piggyback off that deal there, Chris.
*  This is a deal in the moment that I'm figuring out the train machine.
*  Audible.
*  You're not listening to scouts.
*  You're just sitting in the war room.
*  Just sitting in the city of your kids.
*  Tony wrestler's son, you know, he's like, I'm in charge now.
*  Let's go.
*  I got this.
*  How about something instead of you getting, getting Rashawn Holmes back in
*  Philadelphia, you get Mo Bamba and you get Jay Crowder and you give up the
*  Thible and house to the sons, Harold and Corkmoss to the magic.
*  And you get to give up one other salary, minor little baby salary for the
*  like Milton or keep Milton in house.
*  Oh, a very small one.
*  Like it could be Milton deep off the bench.
*  Like this is, this is probably too much.
*  The salaries are tough to match here, but I need work.
*  Mo Bamba and his fucking podcast.
*  I didn't plan on it until Chris mentioned Rashawn Holmes, another mismatched
*  throwback name, the spirit just moved you.
*  You know, you had to get Mo Bamba in here.
*  I mean, I felt good about that, Chris.
*  I was wondering if there was Mo Bamba Celtics potential as that last big guy in
*  case they wanted to remember.
*  They liked him forever.
*  Yeah.
*  Danny angel liked him.
*  Remember that photo?
*  Oh, maybe maybe maybe Utah grab them.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, what do you got, Rob?
*  Where do we want to go here?
*  Okay.
*  Here's, here's a weird one.
*  Kind of a challenge trade.
*  Emanuel quickly to the nuggets for bones Highland.
*  For some reason, Emanuel quickly and bones Highlander on the trade market.
*  I don't really get it.
*  Like both of those are good players.
*  Clearly there's something percolating in Denver as far as I mean, he's consistently
*  in the rumors on the basis of the idea that do we trust this young point guard in
*  essential playoff games basically.
*  And so you're trading him for a guy who is a little further along and a
*  significantly better defender.
*  And in the Knicks, you're getting a different flavor of the same thing that again, I
*  don't really understand why Emanuel quickly is on the block to begin with.
*  But if you want to indulge yourself, let's, let's see what we can do here.
*  The bones thing is so weird to me.
*  That got announced during a nuggets game, like a national TV nuggets game.
*  Yeah.
*  Why would you be in a rush to trade that guy?
*  I don't, I don't really understand.
*  Reports have said that there's friction with the coaching staff involving bones.
*  So that, that has definitely something to do with it.
*  And in the case of the Knicks, I don't understand quickly being involved in the
*  market. I wonder, you know, when I talk to people around the league, how much of
*  this is just other teams putting this out there?
*  Cause quickly he's been damn good the last month or so.
*  I mean, he's scoring the hell out of it, scoring efficiently all year long.
*  You like, we talked about Tibbs earlier, how much he values defense quickly has
*  been so good on defense for them on ball and off ball.
*  So from the next side of things, I don't understand quickly being involved in
*  trade conversations, unless it's a trade up, you know, for a star type player,
*  like a, you know, whether it's a Levine S player or somebody like that, but
*  that's the only way, like it makes sense in my mind to move quickly.
*  That would be an awesome trade for Denver.
*  I, uh, I watch a lot of the nuggets bones.
*  Isn't quite a Yocage fit in my opinion.
*  And there's been some moments, especially when Jamal Murray hasn't played when
*  it's like, I got this and it's like, Yocach has a 25, 17 and 15 right now.
*  Maybe give Yocach the ball bones.
*  Like clear out.
*  I just don't think it's, I think I could see him having, um, you know, one of
*  those crazy like Jordan Clarkson, like he's 28 all of a sudden averaging 28
*  game, but I don't think it's going to happen anytime soon.
*  I don't think it's going to happen for this nuggets team.
*  If they can flip him into a quickly type guy, that's a huge win for them.
*  They need a reliable two way guard in that spot.
*  You know, I do think Christian Christian Braun is going to potentially be that
*  guy every time I've seen him get thrown out there, I'm always like this guy.
*  I really do like him.
*  He's on that.
*  He's on some weird team with like Prichard and Newara and all these guys
*  that when they get thrown out, you're like, Whoa, that guy's pretty good.
*  What doesn't he play more?
*  Um, but yeah, that would be a fun one.
*  I like that one.
*  Am I up?
*  I'm up.
*  Oh boy.
*  This is going to cause some discussion.
*  Are we getting weird now?
*  You're getting a little weird.
*  San Antonio has a really fun trade deadline wrinkle that I'm not sure I've
*  heard people talk about properly enough.
*  They're way under the cap.
*  They're like 25 million under the cap, 24 million, something like that.
*  So they can actually trade out stuff and get a bigger salary back.
*  For instance, I'm going to be like, Oh, I'm going to be like, Oh,
*  that's my business.
*  They can trade Yakka Pertle, Josh Richardson, to the Brooklyn Nets for Ben Simmons.
*  Here's your out.
*  You could just get out of this now guys.
*  Here's, here's a pretty solid center and another wing and you can save
*  20 million bucks, 15 million Pertles, like 9 million Richardson.
*  Twelve.
*  So it's saved like 14 million bucks this year and you're out of the Ben Simmons
*  business.
*  No pick.
*  Perfect place for bed. We'll take him let us like let us pet his his head and fix his broken
*  Paws and fix his wings and just try to rehabilitate him in our log cabin here in San Antonio
*  Wait, wait, which and what animal?
*  I
*  Just like the concept of San Antonio getting Ben Simmons and initially I was like, oh it'll be Pertle and
*  Keldon Johnson and then I'm thinking about like I wouldn't trade Keldon Johnson for Ben Simmons. That's insane
*  So then I eventually settled it at Josh Richardson and Pertle so they'd be selling low
*  If you're broken, but on the other hand you're in the mix and Ben Simmons you cannot trust him
*  Really at all KOC your thoughts. There's only one thing that matters to me involving this trade bill
*  Are the Spurs gonna make Ben Simmons switch shooting hands?
*  Chips not there anymore. That's the problem
*  He's like man, I'm so glad to come to such a top-notch organization where I can get help with my jump shot
*  They're like chip works in Oklahoma brother
*  Look at the shooting 75% with the one-handed motion taking off the guide hand Brett Brown right there with other Spurs coaches
*  That's the next level take is it's not the wrong hand. It's too many hands for Ben Simmons
*  He needs one-handed threes one-handed jumpers. Just go full one hand. Just put the other hand behind your back
*  He had the best years of his career under Brett
*  I can't remember what their personal relationship is but yeah, I think he definitely needs a low-profile
*  Get back to getting double doubles every night kind of it's San Antonio or okay see for me. Those are the two teams
*  and okay see I think is a really fun one too because
*  You know they can kind of easy me now though the problem with them is they're they're probably a little too good
*  I mean, they're actually in the playoff mix San Antonio their seasons over they have a couple of trade assets
*  They can think about but ultimately like I think that's a pretty good gamble for them and they have the money to do it
*  So
*  Rob it can Ben Simmons be redeemed
*  You know life is long, you know, hopefully he plays a long time it can figure some stuff out
*  but he doesn't look very redeemed at the moment he looks he looks like a
*  Stick in the mud of what they're doing on a lot of these possessions and just not the player
*  He was defensively which is a concern for me, you know
*  I really loved who he was before his injury all the different kinds of players he could guard on ball on point guards
*  He was just so incredible
*  He's not really that guy anymore
*  And so if he's not that and he's not really a true big either and really can't like as a small ball five
*  I don't love him as that either. I don't know. He's a hard guy to place
*  I've seen a cat that had a line from Dejan to Murray when he did that that Hawks piece a couple weeks ago and Dejan
*  too was just talking about
*  How loud it is in Atlanta and how like distracting kind of some of the off-court stuff is but in San Antonio is like you
*  Just never heard that stuff
*  Like there was just none of that stuff was ever a factor and I just feel like that's that's where Ben needs to be
*  You know like someplace where it's not
*  Kyrie is next to me KD is not not shaking my hand was I walk off the court kind of stuff. I
*  Asked to see no world and we're playing Nick Claxton and Ben Simmons at the same time when you can only play five people at once
*  Makes sense and I think they there's moments where if KD or Kyrie are lighting up
*  You can kind of get away with it
*  But in the playoffs you can't you can't neither of them could shoot free throws and you don't have to guard either of them
*  So I don't see a world where they should even have both. I think they should seriously consider trading them and
*  Presti is probably too smart to buy into it
*  But if you're San Antonio, you don't you know, you're gonna be in the one Banyama chase. Anyway, you already are you're going nowhere
*  Like why not? Why not roll the dice? What do you have CR?
*  So, can we just do a trade here that's just like hey, I think my guy helps your team and your guide is
*  helpful for our team and just do
*  Bogey Bogdanovich for Karras Levert and get like a dangerous wing for the Cavs interesting. He's got a player option
*  Karras is expiring. I think great and they think about same amount of money. I just I don't know necessarily that
*  Bogdanovich is a
*  Huge upgrade over over Levert
*  But I think he's like enough that it would be really interesting in the playoffs to have him and he has a little bit more
*  Of a playmaker side than Levert does
*  Yeah, I like them
*  I feel like I've been hard to sell you on my trades today. I mean that I love Bogdanovich
*  I think like going back to overseas that dude's been clutch throughout his entire professional career
*  And if I'm Atlanta, I'd like to keep them. I mean, I'm curious about
*  Why Levert for them, you know from the Atlanta side?
*  Yeah, do you have to sweeten it a little bit? Is there something else? Yeah. Yeah
*  Is Robin Lopez too essential to the Cleveland?
*  experience
*  for the vibes
*  Gravid straws
*  It is Bogdanovich is a guy who should be in more of the trade stuff though, I
*  Always like he's like a big game guy
*  Is that true? Yeah, that's it. But what are they like? What do you offer the Hawks? They kind of have
*  Everything at every position but could want to upgrade most of the positions. I don't know we offer them
*  Well as a spin-off of that idea, they do have a lot of things covered. They do have a lot of young guys still
*  I'm kind of curious why the Hawks haven't been more
*  Involved in the OG and a no B derby like that's the guy who feels like they could he feels like a clear upgrade on
*  The Deandre Hunter archetype and so if you could build a deal around
*  Hunter and some combination of bug Donavich in a Kong Wu and Griffin and
*  You know, you're going to way out as far as picks at this point
*  They're so leveraged in terms of their draft equity to get Murray
*  But I kind of wonder if there's something like that for a bug Donavich type deal
*  No, you have to tell the Roy family to do it
*  What do you got for the next trade rap, oh
*  No, KFC Europe or no whose last trade was that oh that was CRS
*  Yeah
*  All right. This is a complicated one
*  This is a complicated one
*  My most complicated one
*  So we had alex Caruso for wisem deal earlier
*  This is an Alex Caruso deal that eventually sends him to the Portland Trailblazers
*  So this deal would eventually land Portland over the city of New York
*  Portland OG and Anobe
*  Jacob Hurdle and Alex Cruz. I'm trying to save the Blazers here
*  Increase their chances as much as possible to win with Damien Lillard the issue for Portland
*  They're facing at the deadline just to preface this Neil O'Shea traded the top 14 protected first-round pick for Larry Nance, Jr
*  That's protected since then through 2028 by rule in the NBA
*  They were not allowed to trade more than one
*  First round pick in the future that would have to be very protected by language
*  And so they're not allowed to trade more than one first at this moment
*  So they need to make a deal with the Bulls to alleviate the protections or change the language of that protection
*  So they can then trade their future first
*  So if I'm the Blazers for the same reason we talked about with Caruso being a fit for the Warriors
*  I'd want them for the Blazers. So in that case, here's the idea that
*  That 2023 first becomes unprotected for the Bulls this year the Blazers get Caruso and Dragic
*  The Bulls get the salary filler and Yusuf Nerkic Vucevic might walk this summer
*  Nersh Nerkic could be their guy restore his value moving forward the Blazers need an upgraded center in this case though
*  So they send a future first to the Spurs with Josh Hart and then Andre Drummond goes from the Bulls
*  The Blazers get Jacob Hurdle and then the top it all off
*  They can send out a future first multiple seconds and Anthony Simons to the Raptors
*  Ferozian Inobi
*  So then you'd end up with Dame
*  Inonobi Caruso Grant Pertle as your starting five with
*  Eubanks behind Pertle and then Peyton little Winslow sharp as your wings with Dragic as an option behind Dame
*  Maybe you have to add one more first in there to Toronto depending on how they value Simons
*  But this type of mega deal I think addresses all of Portland's needs and improves their overall roster and gives them one of the best
*  Starting fives in the NBA
*  so Toronto
*  They're trading in Inobi. They're getting back Simon's in a future pick at least
*  I'm trying to really scoop my brain up off the floor like I'm trying I know it looks like
*  Well, there's there's one there's one flaw in that trade
*  This is where Picasso has to really come in and just kind of help you with the brush
*  Nobody wants Nurkic with that contract I
*  He's I think he's 16 million this year and then he's got three years after this season and I
*  Don't know. I just wouldn't want it. I wouldn't if I'm the Bulls. I'm like, oh cool. We get to get four years of Nurkic. Thanks
*  Can I push back there bill if we're dark though if that pick becomes unprotected this year if you're the Bulls you're betting that
*  The Blazers still fall short and you end up with a lottery pick in a really good draft
*  But that would be your bet. I have to take Nurkic's contract though if it's unprotected though in that case
*  Eventually roll over and it could become unprotected down the road
*  Well, yes, but like if you change the protections it could become something where it is automatically the 20 23 first this year
*  So it would go to Chicago outright no matter what and in that case if that were the language
*  Maybe maybe the Blazers make a big deal and they still end up
*  the 13 seed in the West or the 12 seed and they don't even make the plan and
*  Then you get the 10th 11th best odds and every year with the new draft lottery odds
*  We've had a pick at least from 7th best odds or 11th best odds moving to the top four
*  So if you're Chicago, maybe you're like, yeah screw it. We'll take Nurk
*  Increase our chances. Yeah
*  I'm gonna read this is a writer that I've read a few times on the internet named Kevin O'Connor
*  Who wrote on February 2nd use of Nurkic has become the Blazers weakest link
*  His effort and intensity waiver to
*  Not good at all, but if you're Chicago you're doing it for the for the draft odds in a year with Wemby
*  I'm going the other way. I think the Blazers should pack it in this year. They don't have it this year. I would trade grant
*  they
*  Dame's not going anywhere, which is great
*  and I would try to figure out how to put grant and Nurkage in a deal together and get rid of both of them and
*  Then I just have and maybe trade Josh R2 and just do the one more reboot and then I have sharp who I love
*  Dame and Simon's and then figure out the rest with some cap space versus like what are they gonna win three straight playoff rounds this year?
*  I don't see that happening. So you're fine with with let's say that you do all that in this summer
*  James like you know what I showed loyalty to you. I just had you know, I average over 30 points
*  I had the highest efficiency of my entire career. I actually do want to be traded you'd be okay with that path like
*  I'm
*  Well, I I don't think he would
*  He's has too many quotes over the last couple years of I want to win a title in Portland
*  And if you went you talked to him, you're like we're not gonna win the title this year. Here's what we're thinking
*  You know bring them into it. Maybe what do you Rob? What do you think is that team?
*  That net team is in the definition of no man's land
*  I would say they're even a little below no man's land because they're probably one of the ten worst teams in the league
*  They won great player I don't really understand the team there. They don't have any rim protection at all. Well, they'd have hurdle
*  Yeah, but they'd have to somebody would have to take Nurkic for them to get rid of it's the problem
*  But you're talking about them right now and like they're currently just in general
*  What am I looking at if I'm a Blazer fan?
*  You're looking at something like this
*  like you need an overhaul if you're going somewhere and
*  Either either that involves as you mentioning like a packaging grant a player who's been really good for them with other guys to try to
*  make things happen or
*  this kind of dramatic and reimagining which I admit is like
*  Trade machine bait, you know, this is the kind of thing we would love to see is like what if you just changed out Damien Lillard's
*  entire supporting cast
*  Roster was really good defenders like I would love to see that, you know, I think the stopping point for me is
*  How do we get Toronto enough for OG because right now it's Simons and potentially a first I think is what you have kev's like
*  How could that how can that compete with if we're talking about the Pelicans and the Grizzlies?
*  Having kind of a bidding war for him is that enough right and they could get Dyson Daniel and Dyson Daniel's and three firsts
*  And other stuff they could probably trump it that that's the tough part there
*  It's like what's looming is a team like the Pelicans that can top any offer for any player
*  Whenever they want to as long as they have those 13 future first round picks
*  It would largely have to depend on I mean think about the Toronto side when they landed Kawhi Leonard
*  They were fortunate that San Antonio wanted to keep winning and they wanted to Marta Rosen and Jacob Pertle if you're Toronto
*  Maybe there's offers out there with three or four picks and young players
*  But maybe they're like, you know what we want
*  23 year old Anthony Simons who is trending up and fits perfectly with Scotty Barnes
*  We'd rather have him then to future first that might be in the 20s
*  So I think it would largely have to depend on how does Toronto value Anthony Simons compared to those potential future picks?
*  Can I tell you point out that in Adobe isn't even an all-star?
*  Flashbacks right now. He's gonna get bird of flashbacks
*  I really like Simon's I feel like they're pretty close and trade value, you know
*  Well, they're close I don't think it's like Simon's plus three first for an Adobe. I know no, probably not that much. No
*  Like you know definitely has more trade value
*  But Simon's I really value him. I think he's good. I really liked when
*  Those minutes that he played without dame when dame was heard. I was I was really impressed by some of his crunch time stuff
*  Let's go quick question here. Yes. There were a couple of fake trades that got stymied by guys not being
*  Available to be traded yet, you know
*  contractually and I was wondering what you guys thought about the summer and the summer market based on like and how that impacts whether
*  Or not New Orleans is gonna give up this whole bag of picks
*  Is there anybody better waiting in the summer like a Carl Towns that people might be?
*  Getting involved with but not well, so they would want to keep their powder dry during this this this trade deadline
*  LeBron
*  Trae Young Carl Towns
*  Trae Young definitely
*  Yeah, and I think that factors in too when we were talking about Zach Levine earlier and just like how big his contract is
*  Levine almost needs like another cycle of contracts to come up and guys get signed to big deals that can then get put into trades
*  To start making things work because some of these guys are making so much money now. We're at that weird transitional point
*  We're just making the math work is really hard at some of these deals
*  I kept trying to get Zach Levine to the heat and it I had to restart my computer. It's impossible trade me trade machine just overheated
*  KC what happens if Portland calls Toronto and says sharpened and an OB for a sharpened
*  Simons for an Anobis, I think that's
*  Maybe too much. I'd want to keep sharp if I'm Portland just with everything
*  He's shown this year, right?
*  But I think that type of concept if you're Toronto you get to feel like that's might be the best thing you end up
*  What about sharpened grant for an Anobis?
*  That works, right? Yeah, I don't want grant if I'm if I'm Toronto and I don't want to give up grant if I'm Portland
*  Either Graham really good for them. He's a great fit next to Dame
*  It seems like sharp is off the table for them
*  Right, and I see why the roster better without I
*  See why but like if you're actually trying to build something around Dame now
*  I think it's gonna take too long to wait for sharp personally
*  I think that sharp would be the biggest asset you have. All right, Rob, you're up
*  This is a trade. I'm trying to wheel into existence and it's I think similar to Chris's trade, you know trading Matisse Thiebaud to the Kings
*  I want Jared Vanderbilt to the Kings
*  for Dave Yon Mitchell
*  Jared Vanderbilt shockingly younger than Dave Yon Mitchell
*  So if I'm the Kings I'm thinking like this is a part of our core
*  This is a big who could potentially play with Sabonis give us some of the defensive activity that we want out of that position
*  Obviously you're sacrificing some shooting in terms of making those positions work
*  But Mitchell is like a little bit awkward and redundant for them right now in terms of the place he fills on their roster
*  Whereas if you're Utah, I think you could talk yourself into
*  Basically very few of our perimeter guys are very active, you know defenders on the perimeter. Let's get someone who can get into the ball
*  Let's get someone who while he he fills a similar size profile to what we have
*  Gives us a completely different thing than what we have now
*  I really like that one. What do you think Cassie? I'm into it. I think it makes total sense for both sides
*  CR
*  Yeah, and it's funny how you ties completely fallen out of the like trade talk
*  I mean, I you brought up a linic but they were supposed to be
*  The the all-you-can-eat buffet and they're still lingering, you know, so I'll be curious to see what they do in the next couple weeks
*  Guys like why I also make a Vanderbilt more tradable too. Mm-hmm
*  Well, I also had a Vanderbilt trade. I might as well do it now. This is one of my favorite trades
*  This might be my favorite one. I've come up with
*  Jared Vanderbilt to the Boston Celtics
*  For two white guys Peyton Pritchard and Luke Courtney
*  Who drafted Peyton Pritchard Danny Ainge
*  Who's fucking good Peyton Pritchard Peyton Pritchard's like he had the quotes
*  He was on some podcast and was like, yeah at some point I'd love to be a big piece of something, you know
*  It's fine now, but I I think I'm ready and let me tell you something. I watch a lot of Celtic games
*  He's good. He's gonna have a moment getting 25 to 30 minutes for somebody. He knows what he's doing
*  He really plays hard really good shooter. He's just a good basketball player and it's amazing
*  This season that over and over again
*  He could just not play for a couple games and
*  Then they'll have to throw him in because somebody's hurt or somebody's resting and he could just play 25 minutes
*  And if I'm Utah, they don't really have a guy like him
*  I know they have Conley but you know whether Conley gets traded or whatever happens to him
*  But they don't really have a guy like him and that's I forget who pointed out but the the Kessler emergence has made Vanderbilt a little
*  Yeah, Rob just said that yeah. Yeah
*  So, I don't know I like that fit
*  I don't know if the Celtics have to throw in like a second, but I do like the concept of it
*  What do you think Cassie? I think it makes total sense for both sides. They're considering the age factor
*  He loved Prichard and for Boston like they wouldn't even technically have to give up cornet in that deal to make it work
*  Salary wise because oh, yeah, they have that involved their trade thing. Yeah, right
*  So so they could take in Vanderbilt there a little cornet great. Just one white guy
*  No, I need to
*  Would be perfect though behind Rob Williams and Al Horford has insurance there and plus he can play with them too
*  It's the thing they need. They're a guy short now. It's like the gallo injury
*  They're missing one guy they're in a situation where they're gonna be in a playoff game and
*  Brown and Tatum will both have three fouls in the first half and all of a sudden be like wait, what are we doing?
*  We're gonna play four guards or they just don't have that other kind of three four guys
*  So that's why I think they have to address that what we're gonna say CR
*  I was just gonna ask Rob how it felt to watch the Boston Boston sports mafia
*  in action I
*  Was gonna ask before Kevin jumped in like build you do you believe this pitch you're giving like the pain picture propaganda was
*  off the charts there fair question I
*  Think he's I think he's genuinely good. Like I was mad when he only played six minutes in the Laker game
*  And or there yeah, the one of the one of the last two home games. Yeah, it was the Laker game
*  When Missoula played Tatum for the entire
*  Second quarter and whole second half in the OT and it's like why are we doing this is January? It's the fucking Lakers
*  Pritchard especially at home. Like I think he's had some moments. I I really like him. I think he's good. I think he's
*  He is a good NBA player she's like with Utah they've got not only Conley they got Clarkson they have Sexton
*  We'll see if they keep Mollie Beasley
*  Does he does he play for them? Yeah
*  The saddest possible outcome is for Peyton Pritchard to get traded to Utah and get buried on the bench
*  It might not be enough I do like Pritchard though, I think he's uh, I think he's a piece for somebody what do you what do you got CR?
*  I
*  Have one that was just a real brain breaker and you guys can we can just end the zoom or you guys can mute me
*  Or cut this out if you want to but I like
*  Trey young to the Clippers for Luke can our Reggie Jackson John Wall Terrence man and Moses Brown
*  You didn't draw the line of Moses Brown that wasn't
*  First of all, let me guess let me just tease it out here a little bit, right?
*  It's a little bit of Kawhi and Paul George insurance
*  Trey young, you know younger star very popular with the kids. You're moving into a new building
*  You want to throw a third billboard up there some cool thing like give no quarter and it's Trey young holding a quarter
*  You know, that's the Clippers living
*  Yeah, and it you know
*  I just think that it allows Atlanta then to have this ton of players that they can just juggle
*  Trade in the offseason and do a complete rebuild under the obvious
*  visionary leadership of Tony wrestlers son
*  My nitpick would be I think I think they could get more for Trey young probably this summer when they trade him straight up for
*  Carlinthian towns
*  More than John Wall and Moses Brown in a second
*  No, I did try to come up with some Trey young trades though
*  It's hard a lot of the lot of teams are set at point guard, right?
*  Or like he makes 40 million thirty seven million dollars a year and you you know, I just I couldn't figure out
*  Did you kick the tires on Rob or chaos each you kicked the tires at all in a tray on trade?
*  He's got to be an offseason guy if he's moved at all like he becomes your situation
*  So it's a hard thing to pivot to in the middle of the year
*  Yeah, I like how you pointed that you planted your flag on it though for when it becomes a
*  Story like four months from now
*  That's like what this that trade and my shout of Benedict Mather and should be the number one pick or my two greatest BS report
*  calls of all time
*  Casey what he got? Oh
*  Now I thought that was the last pick for oh
*  Can I give you guys like three others that I really liked? I have some honorable mentions
*  Yeah
*  Why can't Kevin love be traded? What is he just gonna be in Cleveland for the rest of his life?
*  He's an expired contract makes 28 million and Cleveland needs a wing
*  What if what if they traded him to Dallas for Tim Hardaway and Dwight Powell's expiring?
*  To help him hard away in that shooter spot
*  Kevin love on Dallas like he's only playing 20 minutes a game and
*  Dallas gets out of the hard away contract for the summer. Kevin loves too good of a fit next to
*  Jared Allen or Evan Mobley, it's playing 20 minutes a game
*  Yeah
*  Solid though spaces the floor provide size rebounding. All right, I think you have to feel in that one
*  Well, you just have to feel pretty confident about the wing guy
*  You would get if you're gonna give up love to get one the one I was toying around with was would you give up Kevin love?
*  for Jalen McDaniels and Gordon Hayward both and
*  who knows if Hayward can play who knows what role he can really fill for you, but
*  Jalen McDaniels another guy
*  I'm kind of mystified as to why he would be available like Charlotte should really look to keep him
*  But if he is Cleveland is exactly the kind of team that should be trying to get in on it
*  I'm sure Gordon Hayward be psyched to go back to Cleveland
*  Maybe it'll turn out better this time
*  All right next one. Oh
*  I had that just a miles Plumlee for Bones Island
*  or Mason
*  Mason Plumlee, which one's on which one's on Charlotte? I don't know where miles is miles is somewhere
*  But it's not a good the good Plumlee. How about Marshall?
*  But yeah the highland to Charlotte and they get a backup center I want them to get a backup center. All right
*  Two more so see Ockham to Sacramento. I was kicking the tires on oh wow whether it's
*  definitely Barnes Roshan Holmes
*  They're a little limited with how they could trade their first but they can get two unprotecteds
*  I think and then just multiple pick swaps
*  But then the question is does Keegan Murray have to be in that trade?
*  Oh god, does it have to be Harrison Bards and Keegan Murray and then it's less picks
*  But I was thinking like man if just on paper you take the Kings team and instead of the Barnes Holmes minutes
*  Those are all going to see Ockham. Are they better and they're better?
*  If you're the Kings you're a top seed right now in the West and why I do good
*  Well, yeah what that could be the perspective but at the same time are they actually a threat to make a big move?
*  Considering the circumstances that there are nobody's really talking about the Kings
*  We're talking about the Grizzlies the Pelicans the Suns all these teams in the West
*  Nobody's talking about the team that's in the playoffs for the first time
*  What if they want more than just a playoff appearance?
*  Could they be the team that over pays dumps future picks for an all-star caliber talent like see Akam or an OG in an OB?
*  It's just been something on my mind because you don't hear much about the Kings other than looking for a you know backups and fringe players
*  Yeah, and the GM got the extension. So maybe he's got a little bit more confidence. It's one of those funny situations where
*  Sometimes teams that are maybe over performing get a little like overly precious
*  About their roster because they're like look look what we got here. The vibes are immaculate. We don't want to mess with anything
*  Maybe we'll just do something on the fringes
*  But you're right. Maybe this is the opportunity for the Kings to be like we're gonna be good for the next five or six years
*  Yeah, I was looking at it like Vivek
*  It's probably so excited. They're gonna be a playoff team. It's like we could win the title. Let's go for this. What's our next trade?
*  Here's my rule on the trade deadline. I think it's the same rule as like when you're in a bar
*  It's not the guy who's like super loud and seems like he's gonna get into a fight that guy usually does get into a fight
*  It's always like the quiet guy who just punches somebody in the face
*  And the trade deadlines like that
*  The the loud teams are all they might did like those teams a lot of the times end up not making the trades
*  And then it's always like the quiet team. It's like oh my god, the Kings did what?
*  It's always the stealth ones like the Derek White trade last year the South Texas
*  Made there was not one rumor about that. There was not one tidbit mentioned that came out of nowhere
*  And that's usually how the trade deadline works. All right
*  I was really excited about this one
*  Phoenix gets Terry Roger and Isaiah Hartenstein
*  The Knicks get Jay Crowder
*  Plumlee from Charlotte Tory Craig's expiring and the Hornets get reddish
*  The Sarge Rose expirings and a Phoenix first
*  And so Charlotte basically gets a pick they get out of the Roger contract and they get to roll the dice with reddish
*  And Phoenix gets a backup center
*  And they get Roger and then the Knicks turn Hartenstein and Plumlee and they also get Jay Crowder
*  Only the Picasso would go that deep. That's a real having cereal for dinner kind of
*  Like what are we doing?
*  Listen that's this is why I have the resume
*  I want Hartenstein off the Knicks. It really bothers me how they use him and I think he's
*  I just liked watching him on the Quippers last year and I think Tibbs has just kind of ruined him
*  I would like to see him on a team where everybody moved the ball
*  Is there
*  Last one is there did anyone try to get the Demar de Rosa to Miami?
*  Because that's like the classic Miami move or it's like how the fuck did they get the Marta Rosa?
*  But Miami's like the way that Miami's like wage structure is now is like they just have like
*  Bunch of guys making 30 million and a bunch of guys making 1 million and it's so hard to fit
*  Get the trades right for them for me. I maybe i'm just bad at math, but I could not make it work
*  I'm trying to get somebody to Miami like I both of them are like
*  I'm trying to get somebody to Miami
*  I'm trying to get somebody to Miami like I boy on Bogdanovich
*  I think it'd be interesting for Miami if they can get in on someone like him a shooter but like
*  The idea of de rosen and jimmy butler together is a little too spider-man meme for me
*  Like that's a little a little too much of the same flavor
*  Yeah, I was trying to figure out because I think jovich does have some value I like him
*  But they really have no move unless duncan robinson's in the trade
*  Yeah, i'm sure he's been offered every team in the league
*  He doesn't play he makes 17 million a year and he's got three years after this and there's just no way to
*  Move that dude. I do wonder if they'd move on laury if it was the right situation though
*  You know whether it was
*  I don't know if d'angelo russell makes sense for them, but something like that. We're just a big contract
*  Jovich and laury plus some future pick way down the road for blank
*  Could that go i'm
*  As you guys know i'm afraid of miami
*  especially because I pooh-poohed them on a podcast like six weeks ago and I felt I feel like I just
*  You know, it's like in last of us when they're like i'm just gonna get out of the basement
*  See if there's any supplies and then you just get bit
*  That's what it's like to just be like, yeah miami they're done and it's just you watch them and they
*  If it's a close game in the last four minutes, I just feel like they're gonna win. It doesn't even really make sense
*  Right. They it's like oh gabe vincent's out there in crunch time. It's like that doesn't matter
*  That cleveland game the other night was very it was like the classic bullshit miami game. I have
*  I have a friend I won't mention on a celtics text thread who miami drives him crazy and he's just like look at this
*  They made every free throw in this game like he he just treats them like they're a bunch of zombies, which they kind of are
*  There's an alternate universe where they have 10 less wins this season
*  But they just over and over again. They figure out a way to pull these games out and they're really confident
*  So i'm hoping they don't improve
*  And celtics fan and plus with bam adabio like you saw him drop 30 against the celtics a couple weeks ago bill
*  bam has taken a leap on offense while still and you know being the total anchor of their defense regardless of the scheme they're using and
*  They use every scheme because of bam adabio. I think you know chris vernon said to me in the mismatch earlier in the year
*  We're talking about is miami dead. Are they not a finals contender anymore?
*  And he's like, yeah, but with jimmy butler you can't look at him taking
*  1415 shots per game in the regular season. He's up to 25 plus in the postseason. They're a totally different team come playoff time
*  So i'm i'm with you guys there that miami remains a threat
*  I just love the idea that bill you're in a text thread that's just like flipping out over caleb martin night tonight
*  You know just like cannot cannot contain its excitement over what's going on in miami
*  I have a friend that miami just drives him nuts. He just doesn't understand it
*  Chris before we go do you want to do wayne jenkins as the lakers gm or no?
*  Oh shawed barks goddamn lebron
*  I didn't know you really wanted me to trade those picks
*  I thought that was a handshake deal
*  Um before we go who do you want to who do you have in the west right now if you had to pick a team
*  I have denver right now, but I think the warriors it's easier for them to improve their team
*  Then they might be able to make two trades because they have the wasman trade, but they could also do like the
*  Moody with something else and patch a couple contracts together and they might end up getting two guys
*  Over the next week. I think they might be able to make two trades. I think they might be able to make two trades
*  So they might be able to make two trades
*  Moody with something else and patch a couple contracts together and they might end up getting two guys over the next week
*  Um, is there a wild card team that you're intrigued by?
*  out of curiosity
*  What about the nets?
*  Yeah, I was gonna say
*  They've come up a couple times in this conversation, but they're a team that like
*  They don't have a lot to give obviously they don't have a lot of their own picks
*  But it's like can you get like cam thomas and the first you got from philly and get something out of that
*  Like can you leverage that into a rotation player of some kind?
*  Uh, I think I think they could be interesting like they've put themselves in that position where they should at least be knocking on some doors
*  What do you want if you're them like what's the most important thing at the top of the shopping list?
*  Real wing length and defense
*  Yeah
*  Like they have so many small guards who are deserving of playing time and could fill out lineups
*  But they feel like a jalen mcdaniels team to me like if you if you can get that conversation going I could see that working out
*  Yeah, it feels like you keep one of seth curry or mills
*  I don't think simmons can factor into the plans anymore personally. Maybe some other people would be more patient with it, but
*  um
*  It does feel like there's some bigger deal they could make and i'd be really interested to see if they actually put simmons
*  On the table because it seemed like there was some frustration last week with
*  Oh, yeah, whatever was going on with him and what just watching him during the games
*  You know all the bad habits seem to be resurfacing
*  um
*  I don't know the
*  This kairi resurgence we'll see how long it lasts
*  But if they're gonna have that happening at the same time as the way kd's playing you have to
*  Kick the tires in every way you can I just can't figure out what their best five is when I watch them
*  right because it's
*  You know with kairi makes it so hard to play a second guard next to him because you just get killed on defense
*  You can't play simmons and klaxon at the same time. You're the kd piece
*  But I just I don't know who the right five is
*  I'm not a giant rois o'neil fan. I don't know how you guys feel about that one, but
*  Um, and maybe that's part of that too. Maybe if you could put some pieces with him and try to get a better wing
*  We'll see what happens. All right guys
*  This is fun first ever fake trade draft. What was your favorite fake trade? Just added curiosity around the horn
*  Oh, I definitely bend simmons to the spurs
*  Oh, thanks chris. Yeah, you got what you have koc
*  That that's a very good one. Um
*  Of my own the sons raptors hawks one that we opened with yeah on my list
*  Yeah, hard to beat that off the top just like trying to wrap actually no
*  I do love kevin's four team trade to the blazers overhaul featuring the spurs raptors
*  That's good. That's incredible
*  Yeah, it was actually very like out of character for koc because he's trying to save the mediocrity of portland
*  Yeah, why do you care so much about portland? I don't understand that koc. I mean, I mean I think with portland you
*  The draft lottery odds changing, you know
*  Changed the entire equation like it's not 25 up top
*  You can win the lottery if you're in that seven to ten or eleven range at this point
*  So that changed things and plus dame has been
*  Unbelievable and jeremy grants really good like they I think they have
*  Portland has glimmers of what they've been missing with the the cj dame core for years
*  it's just the simon's dame core has a ceiling and now if you can
*  build with grants and
*  and dame and
*  Gary paten and the seer little who deserves more minutes by the way, there's something there
*  I love this for your second at koc. There's nothing wrong with finishing seventh
*  Yeah
*  People need stuff to pay attention to finish seventh. It's great
*  That would be a good podcast too koc. There's something there hosted by kevin o'connor
*  You're just trying to talk yourself into different franchises in different sports
*  And then the podcast just goes we never did an okc trade
*  I want them to get there. They're the silent guy at the bar
*  I'd like to put them in the silent guy in the bar club. I want them to get towns next year
*  Oh interesting towns and chet. That's interesting towns chet giddy and shea. Oh and victor apparently
*  That's the friggin beetles right there
*  Ksc you have no intel on if the
*  Thunder were kind of lingering that check we might see him this year. They would never do that, right?
*  I don't think so
*  I'd be i'd be shocked if that happened all indications were they're gonna rest him the entire season
*  Let him build his body back and bring him back next year for his rookie season
*  What a soft culture we're living now
*  Really
*  They should make tibs the gm of the thunder
*  You're getting out there tomorrow
*  All right guys, thanks this is fun
