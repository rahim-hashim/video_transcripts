# Draymond Green Is a True One of One, With Zach Lowe | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=0.0s)]
*  Our friend Zach Lowe is here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=0.32s)]
*  We're taping this before the four Tuesday games, but also before the two Wednesday [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1.44s)]
*  games. And it's an awesome double header of golden state, Houston, Lakers, T Wolves. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=5.92s)]
*  I covered it on my pod on Sunday. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=11.36s)]
*  You covered it on the Zach Lowe show on, uh, on Monday, but we're here to talk about [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  Draymond green. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=17.76s)]
*  And then we can talk about those games at the tail end. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=18.48s)]
*  Last week we did Kawhi. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=21.2s)]
*  We deep dove this week. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=22.72s)]
*  We're going to do Draymond and we're going to deep dive. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=24.72s)]
*  You wrote about him. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=27.36s)]
*  I think two years ago, maybe right after the pool incident. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=28.32s)]
*  Many, many times, but yes, including, including, uh, taking that moment as a, hey, wait a [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=31.92s)]
*  second, let's take stock of this guy's warriors career, which felt a little, a little like [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=37.68s)]
*  it was on shaky ground is the words or approaching, you know, um, the, do we pay all of these [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=42.88s)]
*  guys, the young guys, the old guys, everybody, can we do that? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=48.56s)]
*  And if not, who's the casualty? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  It's felt one of the things I was thinking about as we go into this, is that we're [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=54.24s)]
*  going to be at the end of the road with Draymond and the warriors. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=58.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=61.44s)]
*  And the pool punch was the first time. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=62.0s)]
*  The second time was when are they going to be able to figure out his contract or not? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=64.56s)]
*  And then even this year when it didn't really seem like they had any moves and the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=68.16s)]
*  question became, well, I mean, maybe would Draymond be somebody that they bench be [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=73.44s)]
*  trying to flip? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=78.72s)]
*  Um, he's feels, I don't want to say thin ice, but it's felt a little rocky. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=79.44s)]
*  And now I feel the best about it that I felt probably since the, uh, the 22 [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=84.96s)]
*  finals, but even the 22 finals, he was getting yanked around. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=88.96s)]
*  I don't think he looked particularly great. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  He looks great now. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=94.0s)]
*  And this Curry Draymond thing is now officially over a decade. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=95.91999999999999s)]
*  And there's something really unique and special about it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=99.6s)]
*  Um, that just continues to persevere and you could feel it in that Houston game. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=103.11999999999999s)]
*  Um, it felt like the punch changed his standing with the old guys. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=107.11999999999999s)]
*  Like the punch changed his standing within the warriors. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=112.88s)]
*  They've all, they've all acknowledged that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=115.6s)]
*  Like that, that, that was very hard for the team to get over. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  It was very hard for Jordan pool to get over. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=120.63999999999999s)]
*  Then you follow it up with the suspensions, right? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  Like last season we get suspended for, I don't know how many games he was [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=125.6s)]
*  indefinitely after the go bear incident and then the Nurkic incident. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=129.28s)]
*  And then there was like the flirtation with Memphis in free agency that I think [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  was at least semi real, um, you know, I'd, or the potential of it anyway. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=136.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=141.68s)]
*  I mean, it's, but, but I always wrote, I mean, you know, who's sad listening to this [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  is the guy who signed with Dallas and free agency to play with Luca and make some [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=146.08s)]
*  spot up threes. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=150.56s)]
*  And I always wrote that those three guys were, it was magic. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=151.44s)]
*  Like it's why you play basketball to get that kind of level of feel and chemistry [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=155.12s)]
*  and just, you can do it with your eyes closed. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=160.32s)]
*  You know, where everyone's going to be at all time, that those three guys were [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  meant to play together and should have played together forever. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=165.52s)]
*  And at least two of them look like they are going to play together forever in [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=168.24s)]
*  their NBA lives. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=172.16s)]
*  It's the hardest thing to find in professional basketball now with the way [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=173.68s)]
*  guys move around with the way now we have this first second apron, you know, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=176.88s)]
*  I'm always thinking like we had the last episode of Celtic city and it's built [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=182.4s)]
*  around Brown and Tatum. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=185.92s)]
*  And it's just like, I don't even know if it's sustainable to have two guys making [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=187.04s)]
*  a max once it gets into the sixties, seventies anymore. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=190.96s)]
*  They would Brown and Tatum have, I don't think remotely approaches the Draymond [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=194.72s)]
*  Curry thing, because those guys actually had figured out how to elevate each [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=198.48s)]
*  other, which I think is the last level when you're talking teammates. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=202.56s)]
*  Clay was in there too, but really Draymond, you can feel when Draymond [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=205.27999999999997s)]
*  wasn't in the game, what it meant to Curry, all the little, uh, pick and pops [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=209.27999999999997s)]
*  and handoffs and just that ESP that they had for each other. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=213.6s)]
*  I can't think of like this, the, the, when I was growing up, they always [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=217.83999999999997s)]
*  talked about how the seventies Knicks had that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=223.44s)]
*  I think bird and McHale kind of got there. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  I think Jordan and Pippen almost like defensively as athletes became so attuned, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=228.08s)]
*  like they almost seemed like a pair after a while. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=232.96s)]
*  It's really hard to get to. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=235.44s)]
*  And with Draymond, I feel I've always felt like there's gonna be a shelf life [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=237.52s)]
*  and it was going to flame out. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=240.96s)]
*  And he was just being more and more erratic as his career went on. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=242.56s)]
*  He had the podcast. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=245.44s)]
*  He's becoming unlikeable in a lot of ways too. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=246.96s)]
*  And then you watch like last night and it's like, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  I was going to say he almost got it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=252.0s)]
*  He's almost ejected from like every third game. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=253.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=257.44s)]
*  Your weight, you're just teetering on this balance beam with him. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=257.6s)]
*  And, you know, he gets that first technical and then you instantly get the flashbacks [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=261.52s)]
*  to 2016 game four when I, I'll always think LeBron knew what he was doing. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=264.72s)]
*  And I think it was a smart play. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=268.88s)]
*  He tried to bait Draymond into retaliating, knowing that one more or anything and Draymond [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=270.0s)]
*  was suspended for the next game. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=276.16s)]
*  If you're right and there's never maybe one day they'll LeBron will talk about this and [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=277.68s)]
*  try to make himself the protagonist of that one step ahead thing is Draymond has also [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=283.04s)]
*  tried to make himself the protagonist of like almost everything good that's happened for [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=287.6s)]
*  the Warriors, including you mentioned the 2022 finals. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=291.76s)]
*  The turning point for him was getting in Jalen Brown's head. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  That was like being physical with Jalen Brown getting in his head. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=297.44s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=300.24s)]
*  I knew we had him at that moment. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=300.8s)]
*  I mean, he said that, but if, if, if you turn out to be right about this, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=302.08000000000004s)]
*  LeBron thing, what a tribute to Draymond Green's greatness, actually, that LeBron thought it [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=307.12s)]
*  was worth, it was worth getting him out of the series for a game, right? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=311.6s)]
*  That he, that he respected him that much, but you mentioned all these prior teammate combinations. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=315.68s)]
*  And what's super interesting about this one is that we've seen like Tatum and Brown, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=321.44s)]
*  you went Tatum and Brown and backwards to some of the historical ones. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=326.32s)]
*  We've seen the game has been ruled by big men. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=329.52s)]
*  Like you mentioned, Mikhail low post guys, Shaq and Kobe. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=333.04s)]
*  We can go on and on and big wings. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=336.08s)]
*  These guys are neither of those things and they're both totally unusual superstars or stars, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=338.96s)]
*  whatever you want to call Draymond in NBA history and almost archetypal players that are [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=344.8s)]
*  specifically archetypal to this era of three point shooting, which Steph revolutionized and [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=350.0s)]
*  accelerated the development was going to happen anyway. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=356.4s)]
*  And Draymond as the ultimate switch defender, when more defenses were like, we just got to try and [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=359.03999999999996s)]
*  switch everything because the shooting is so massively important and swing so many games. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=364.56s)]
*  And Draymond may not have a good sort of analog in the history of the NBA. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=370.32s)]
*  Steph obviously has no analog in the history of the NBA and, and Steph Steph is, is one of one. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=375.84s)]
*  Draymond became this weird archetype where for about four or five years, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=383.76s)]
*  people search the draft for, we got to find someone like Draymond. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=388.56s)]
*  We find our Draymond could grant Williams be our kind of Draymond. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=392.0s)]
*  Williams is the funniest one. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=395.04s)]
*  Yeah. And it was, it's just so interesting that you go through those pairs of superstars and these [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=396.32s)]
*  two guys are just strange in terms of body type skillset and not only just strange, but strange [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=401.36s)]
*  and meant to play in this era and meant to play together in this era. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=407.76s)]
*  Yeah. Like, uh, I remember he started playing when we were working together at grant land [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=414.32s)]
*  and it was the early days of the five band lineups and the plus minus stuff really early, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=419.44s)]
*  like primitive, like your people are carving it out in stone. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=424.71999999999997s)]
*  The numbers trying to figure it out. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=428.0s)]
*  We have websites that are dead, that are gone. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=430.64s)]
*  Like you get like a virus if you downloaded any of the websites, but there was some stuff [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=432.96s)]
*  with David Lee and it was one of the first times. Cause I remember that there was that grizzly [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=437.52s)]
*  season and I was on TV that year with Memphis where the Rudy gay lineups versus the non Rudy [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=442.0s)]
*  gay lineups. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=447.2s)]
*  To dark time, the Rudy, the Rudy gay discourse. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=448.48s)]
*  Well, but remember they trade him and everyone went nuts and the people who were actually like [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=451.2s)]
*  kind of studied in this shit were like, eh, they might not miss him. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=456.32s)]
*  And then he, they make the Western finals, but there was a similar thing going on with David Lee [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=460.0s)]
*  who had good stats, good counting stats, hustled was the type of guy that in the old school way [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=464.8s)]
*  be like, like that guy, good jump hook, like he does some good stuff. And he was a, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=470.32s)]
*  you know, a good starter, but Draymond was in there. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=474.24s)]
*  And the lineups took off. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=477.92s)]
*  Always the foil in this story. David Lee, a very good NBA player who could do a lot of good NBA [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=479.68s)]
*  things, including, you know, remember that finals when they started to go small against the [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=484.88s)]
*  Cavaliers and it was like a garbage time of the, of a game they were losing. And David Lee was [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=489.12s)]
*  like heavily involved. Yeah. Yeah. Draymond, you know, was picked 35th in his draft. Warriors [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=492.8s)]
*  picked him after they picked Festus Azuli in the same draft. So it's kind of like the old, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=499.6s)]
*  you know, when I, when I used to wax poetic to the spurs about, you know, Manu Janobli's [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=505.28s)]
*  the greatest draft pick in the history of the NBA. You guys were such geniuses picking him at 50, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=510.0s)]
*  whatever. And they would always tell me, well, if we were such geniuses, why did we pick Gordon [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=513.68s)]
*  Girsak like 25 spots higher in the same draft? Right. That's the Tom Brady. They passed on him [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=517.36s)]
*  every round until the sixth round. Same thing. And it's, it's the same with Azuli and Draymond, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=522.8s)]
*  but maybe Draymond is the only one that expected anything even 50% as great as the career and [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=527.68s)]
*  impact he ended up having on a team that ended up being the absolute perfect place for him. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=534.96s)]
*  Why he always had the confidence, right? So he won in high school and he won in college. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=541.6s)]
*  And then he came to the pros. He wasn't playing that much. And I remember I was on, I was on [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=546.5600000000001s)]
*  countdown. I might've been the 2013 season. We were talking about the Warriors in the playoff, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=551.36s)]
*  2013 or 14. And we were talking about how nobody could shoot on the Warriors other than staff and [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=555.52s)]
*  Clay. I forget what it was. And I made some joke about, you don't want Draymond throwing up bricks [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=560.96s)]
*  or stuff like that. And he came at me on Twitter and I was like, look at this guy. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=565.36s)]
*  I kind of liked the face of this. So it was like, all right, that's cool. But he, he always kind of [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=571.6s)]
*  carried himself. Like you guys don't realize how good I am yet. And then 2015, uh, once Lee gets [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=577.44s)]
*  hurt and the rest is history, but that's, I always think about luck with this stuff where you think, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=583.44s)]
*  you know, they just became a story again recently about Bogut talking about the thing that I thought [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=589.36s)]
*  everybody knew that Milwaukee had the choice between Ellis and Curry in that trade and Curry's [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=594.5600000000001s)]
*  ankles were so, are you, you, you're dubious of that one? Or are you? No, I mean, it's been, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=599.52s)]
*  it's been whispered about for so long. Um, I, I, can we ever really confirm it? I mean, like who, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=605.28s)]
*  has anyone in the room in a public setting come out and confirmed it? I always heard they gave [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=612.96s)]
*  them the choice. I don't think Lake up, whoever admitted that was Lake up even there at that point. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=618.8000000000001s)]
*  He was right. Whoever the owners were. Yeah. Cause I think there was this real feeling that Curry's [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=623.6s)]
*  ankles were always going to be an issue, you know, that, that this was never going to be a thing that [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=629.9200000000001s)]
*  healed. So you get luck with that. You keep Curry, you get, how about, how about you get the discount [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=634.0s)]
*  on his first contract, four years, 44 million or something like that. That allows you to do all [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=639.36s)]
*  this other stuff. That's luck. Number two, luck. Number three is the Kevin love trade, which is [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=643.28s)]
*  one of the most polarizing organizational, should we do this or not? Sagra is probably ever to the [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=648.08s)]
*  point that they're asking people like us, what do you think? Would you do this? Would you put, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=653.44s)]
*  and that wouldn't that have been ultimately, would that been David Lee with clay and maybe [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=657.76s)]
*  even Draymond in that trade too? I, I, I don't remember exactly what it was except that clay [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=663.44s)]
*  was in it. I think I remember iterations being discussed with clay and Harrison Barnes, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=668.48s)]
*  both in it. Um, I don't remember exactly what it would have been other than it was a clear, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=673.12s)]
*  like clay was in the trade. It was like splash brothers or no splash brothers. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=677.36s)]
*  And I think Kerr was one of those who was like, I think the shooting that we have is like really [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=682.24s)]
*  special. Jerry West, Jerry West was ready to throw himself in front of the train tracks on that. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=687.28s)]
*  It's like, we're not doing this. This is a bad move. Do you think he had like a winning time [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=691.52s)]
*  tantrum, like the guy in winning time, do you throw a chair through the glass window? No, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=694.4s)]
*  he hated his portrayal in winning time and RIP to the logo. One of the best, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=698.72s)]
*  one of the best. Well, now we have the half court logo, Ben Simmons. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=703.6800000000001s)]
*  He gets to the half court logo and he stops dribbling. Um, but then the other, the other [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=707.36s)]
*  luck thing was, uh, was the, the cap spike in 16 and all of these things come together. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=711.6s)]
*  And really the only unlucky break, I mean, until 2019, the only unlucky break was that Draymond, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=717.44s)]
*  uh, you know, punching LeBron in the balls. Have you watched that clip recently? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=723.76s)]
*  I have not. It is the most dubious. I forgot how awful it was. I, I, it's, it might be number one [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=728.48s)]
*  for me for the league stepping in and trying to push a narrative. It is awful. It's comes up. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=735.84s)]
*  He kind of swing cause LeBron standing over him. Like they get caught up and he's just standing [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=741.76s)]
*  over him like a little almost baiting him and Draymond gets up and he kind of waves his hand. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=747.52s)]
*  And, uh, I just still can't believe that happened because if you remember from what's the score in [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=752.8s)]
*  that bucks game. No, no, I'm actually, I want to, I'm, I'm trying to remember in my head [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=757.76s)]
*  the sequence of events from that series. So I'm looking up the game logs. I'm going to talk about. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=762.8s)]
*  So I want to talk about that game really quick is game four. When Draymond gets kicked out or [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=767.36s)]
*  gets the flagrant at the end or whatever it was, they go into Cleveland. They're up two, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=771.92s)]
*  one in the series. It's probably one of my favorite five warriors games from that whole [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=777.12s)]
*  career era because they lay the smack down like Cleveland, they're toe to toe. They pulled away. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=782.8s)]
*  Down the stretch, pulled away down the stretch and we, and we're leaving that game going, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=787.68s)]
*  they definitely have the best team. This is going to be the greatest season in the history of the [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=791.76s)]
*  NBA. And then the suspension happens in it. So I was at the game and I, I have this memory of doing [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=795.28s)]
*  something after the game with J. A. Donde maybe. Um, I don't know why that would make sense. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=803.76s)]
*  And you know, when you're at these games, sometimes you're not looking at the video, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=810.8s)]
*  the video feed like, um, in detail and none of us realized at the time exactly what had happened [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=815.2800000000001s)]
*  and put together what was possible. And now this is why I was looking back at it. So that was [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=823.9200000000001s)]
*  June 10th, one Oh eight 97 warriors win. There were two days off until the next game [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=828.48s)]
*  in the Bay, June 13th. And I remember they took a while to rule on it because I went out to dinner [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=836.4000000000001s)]
*  on June, what would be June 11th, I guess, with a couple of warriors people. And they were like, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=843.84s)]
*  I mean, the tent, the level of tension, it was not that fun of a dinner because [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=850.4s)]
*  they, Bogut was already out and Curry was, Curry had the, what was his ankle injuries. So they were [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=854.88s)]
*  kind of limping to the finish line as it was, but it was not a fun dinner because they didn't know [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=860.8000000000001s)]
*  still what was going to happen with Draymond. They were fuming about what they viewed as lobbying by [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=865.44s)]
*  the Cavaliers for a suspension. They were fuming because they thought the league was going to quote, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=871.92s)]
*  I mean, every team see everything through the lens of their own bias and what is good or bad for them. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=877.12s)]
*  And they viewed it like the league is going to scapegoat Draymond. We could see this coming, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=882.9599999999999s)]
*  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It was not a fun dinner. And then it was another full day until [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=886.8s)]
*  they announced the suspension. Then he goes and watches it from the A's. Well, didn't he go to [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=891.12s)]
*  the A's game or so he was a luxury box somewhere with Bob Myers. I remember that was indefensible. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=895.28s)]
*  The suspension. So you think the suspension was there, but it was a flagrant points thing. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=901.2s)]
*  It was, he had accumulated all the points, right? You can't decide a finals like that. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=905.9200000000001s)]
*  And it was bogus. I feel like it was bogus. The Robert Horace shove, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=910.4s)]
*  when he shoved Kerr into the scores table and a couple of, Kerr, Nash into the scores table and [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=915.36s)]
*  a couple of Nash's teammates responded because you're going to, you're going to move toward your guy [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=920.96s)]
*  who just got decked in the scores table. I thought that, and I thought the Miami, New York thing [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=925.44s)]
*  in the late nineties was those were the three that really stayed out to me. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=929.92s)]
*  Yeah. I'm reading it now. This is Kiki Vandewee, Kiki Vandewee involved. I remember, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=933.28s)]
*  I remember they were waiting to hear from Kiki. The cumulative points system is designed to deter [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=937.6s)]
*  flagrant fouls in our game. Kiki Vandewee said, while Draymond Green's actions in game four [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=942.8s)]
*  do not merit a suspension as a standalone act, the number of flagrant points he has earned triggers [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=947.6s)]
*  a suspension for game five. And I remember he had a couple of really dumb ones in the early, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=953.6s)]
*  in that series. There was one, he like throws Michael, I think Michael Beasley is involved. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=958.96s)]
*  He plays for the Rockets at that time and he throws them to the ground and like almost garbage time [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=962.96s)]
*  of like a decided game. You're like, what are you, what are you doing, man? And there was, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=967.84s)]
*  that's the Steven Adams. This is what Draymond got to know. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=971.36s)]
*  Steven Adams growing quite well. They're still going at it right now. Steven Adams and Draymond [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=975.52s)]
*  Green. The other thing is he comes back, calves blow them away in game five, game six, but Draymond [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=982.24s)]
*  comes back from game seven and plays the best game of his career. And I think he's single-handedly [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=988.32s)]
*  keeps them in the game because Curry is running on fumes of his fumes of his fumes. At that point, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=993.28s)]
*  that game got super tense. The last five minutes is an all time rock fight after LeBron hits the [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=997.52s)]
*  two threes over Azili because the words are a guy short and, and that Draymond games wasted. And he's [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1003.36s)]
*  I don't want to say he's the reason they didn't win the title that year, but that incident, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1010.4s)]
*  I think they went in five. I just think they go back to, to Golden State and finish it. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1015.52s)]
*  It felt like a, we've seen this series a hundred times, a million times before road, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1020.9599999999999s)]
*  road favorite wins game four, kind of a tough gutsy win on the road goes up three, one finishes [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1027.44s)]
*  the job at home. Like we've all seen this, but we're taping this on Tuesday at six 45. There's [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1032.8799999999999s)]
*  like three series are zooming tonight that feel exactly like that in the current first round. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1037.6s)]
*  So you wrote, when you wrote about Draymond, you used a word that I thought was a great word [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1043.28s)]
*  and I wanted to put it in the context of, uh, of history. So I was talking about glue guys, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1049.4399999999998s)]
*  right? He's better than a glue guy. Oh, no question. You, he's not obviously not like a star [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1056.56s)]
*  role player. That seems too low too. But in the piece you wrote that you used their noun amplifier, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1064.6399999999999s)]
*  how he amplified Steph and all of these different ways. And I was thinking like, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1070.8799999999999s)]
*  that's the right word amplifier. So I was going through like my favorite amplifiers [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1076.48s)]
*  because I think that feels like it's more status, right? It's that you're not a role [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1082.08s)]
*  player. You're not a glue guy. You're like, I am, I am actually better than a role guy. And not only [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1086.08s)]
*  that, but if you put me next to an awesome guy, I'm going to make that guy better. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1091.68s)]
*  So Rodman, I think is an all time amplifier. I think Ben Wallace got there in the, in the [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1096.4s)]
*  mid 2000s, Oh three to Oh seven. Horry is a classic example, seven titles, but you could kind of fit [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1104.48s)]
*  him in. He didn't need the ball. He could guard whoever he could guard different positions. You [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1111.3600000000001s)]
*  could always count on him come through and it mattered. Michael Cooper, Bobby Jones, Paul Silas, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1116.8s)]
*  Casey Jones was the famous one from the Russell Celtics. And then there's some, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1125.36s)]
*  there's two old, I put older in front of these guys names, older Andre Guadala. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1130.32s)]
*  So we're like around 15 range, right? Double amplification for the warriors. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1136.72s)]
*  He could have been the best guy on a 45 win team in his prime, but older version. And then I think [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1140.72s)]
*  older drew holiday too. Uh, kind of the bucks Celtics era. And then the only other two I have, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1146.0s)]
*  and I, there may be is for me or Derek Fisher and Bruce Bowen. Yeah. Draymond's on another level [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1153.12s)]
*  from that's how I feel too. I wanted to, I wanted to mark them down. Um, but I think of all those [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1158.4s)]
*  guys, I think Draymond might've been the best amplifier. I think he might be the number one [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1164.4s)]
*  amplifier. Well, let's, let's, let's keep, let's be simple about it. You know, people do this thing [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1169.68s)]
*  with Draymond. We're like, well, what would he be if the, if he got drafted by the pistons and he [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1176.3200000000002s)]
*  doesn't have Steph and how many, even ex players have sort of derided Draymond like this. He has [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1179.92s)]
*  Steph and clay and all he has to do is throw a handoff to them. Wow. Big whoop Draymond green. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1184.48s)]
*  Yeah. But, um, he's not the same player without Steph Curry. Almost nobody would be. If you're [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1188.24s)]
*  ranking the reasons why the warriors have four championships in the last whatever years, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1196.8s)]
*  it's Steph Curry up here at number one and then a giant gap between whatever you think number one [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1200.56s)]
*  and number two, what number two is. And that's fine and fair. Um, Draymond has two things that [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1206.24s)]
*  I think are indisputable, but I think he's a hall of Famer. Uh, he's, I think he should be all of [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1211.9199999999998s)]
*  Famer. No question. Michael Cooper made the hall of fame. I mean, even whatever he's the greatest [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1216.1599999999999s)]
*  defender of his generation, which I would define as sort of like the post KG Duncan [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1221.52s)]
*  generation of players, he might be the most versatile defender in modern NBA history. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1226.4s)]
*  He is like, there's this alternate reality where, okay, so imagine the words without Draymond green, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1234.0s)]
*  but they have Steph Curry and clay Thompson and Harrison Barnes and whatever else. They're still [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1240.56s)]
*  awesome. They still might be a championship team. You could, you could replace Draymond with, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1244.08s)]
*  I use Clint Capella as my like stand in screen and dive, spread, pick and roll center, blah, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1248.16s)]
*  blah, blah. But Draymond Draymond's ability to play center on defense and switch across every [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1254.24s)]
*  position is completely unique, almost completely unique in modern NBA history. And he's also, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1261.92s)]
*  while at center, one of the greatest passers on the move in the history of the NBA. And both of [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1268.4s)]
*  those things allow the warriors to play a style that is completely unusual and unique to them. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1274.88s)]
*  And he's a big part of that. And he lifts up. Curry is better because of all the stuff Draymond [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1281.44s)]
*  can do when you give him four on threes, when you play a handoff back and forth with him, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1286.88s)]
*  when you are, when you can take certain risks defensively because you can play this super [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1292.3200000000002s)]
*  small ball lineup, because he's a six, six guy, you can play center the defense and the passing [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1297.1200000000001s)]
*  is a guy he's led the team in assists like many times. It's, it's not, that's what separates him [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1303.1200000000001s)]
*  from like your glue guy role player. Like those dudes aren't dishing seven, eight, nine, 10 assists [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1308.24s)]
*  approaching tri, you can triple singles. He gets made fun of a lot for that, but those are almost [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1312.88s)]
*  triple doubles. He's a totally unusual player and, and made the warriors both unusual and better. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1317.6000000000001s)]
*  Those four on threes you mentioned, he's gotta be in the running for the best one in that situation. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1324.64s)]
*  We see it all the time now, right? Like even the nuggets, clipper series, the nuggets are trying [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1330.8s)]
*  to put Zubots in that situation. He's been, he's been doing really well. Those guys are really good [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1335.12s)]
*  at it. He's been really good at it. Hartenstein, you know, they'll try to put him Horford as somebody [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1339.76s)]
*  that gets in that situation, but through the league, when teams are trying to take out somebody, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1343.52s)]
*  oh, let's do four on three. And the guy at the foul line will make the bad decision. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1349.04s)]
*  The thing with Draymond is the warriors just know how to cut. It's like, it was amazing to watch [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1352.8s)]
*  Butler immediately fit into that, right? It took him like 10 seconds to be like, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1356.48s)]
*  oh, if they're going to do that, I'm just going to cut. I'll get layups. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1361.28s)]
*  Horford is a great name because he's still good at it now. And in his prime, when he was more [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1364.24s)]
*  athletic and faster, he was really, really close in sort of speed and decision-making to what prime [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1370.24s)]
*  Draymond is or was, but he wasn't as, Draymond is, I mean, in the stupidest sense is just so fast. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1377.68s)]
*  He moves really fast compared to the average big guy who's going to set a screen and roll to the [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1384.3999999999999s)]
*  rim. And then he makes his decisions faster and more intelligently than almost everybody else in [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1389.2s)]
*  the league in that situation. It's a really hard, it's not a hard combination to find. It's like a [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1395.36s)]
*  borderline impossible combination to find because there has been no next to Draymond Green. And, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1399.12s)]
*  you know, you can do the counterfactuals of like, well, does he even get those four on threes if [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1404.56s)]
*  he's playing with whatever anonymous Eastern Conference guards in Charlotte or Detroit or [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1409.2s)]
*  whatever. And the answer is he doesn't get them in the same way with the same amount of space [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1414.0800000000002s)]
*  in the same frequency. He just changed how he played, I think. But I do think he would have [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1419.3600000000001s)]
*  been a very good player, a great player anywhere because the defense and the passing are translatable [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1424.24s)]
*  skills to any setting. It was hard to recognize in the moment for a little while because we were so [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1431.2s)]
*  used to these six foot six undersized guys getting drafted, going 15 picks too late. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1438.56s)]
*  There was that whole Brandon Bass generation of NBA player in the 2000s where it was like, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1443.36s)]
*  they couldn't shoot threes. They were bangers. They were second round picks or low value guys. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1449.6s)]
*  They were all missing something, right? They were either three inches too short [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1456.3999999999999s)]
*  or they couldn't really rebound or they, you know, David West was probably the best version of all [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1461.04s)]
*  of them. And Draymond just seemed like, oh, he's going to be in that bucket. And then to watch the [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1465.76s)]
*  player that he became. And then we need to mention like the competitiveness and that I don't think [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1470.8s)]
*  anybody has ever been more of an alpha who probably has a worse basketball reference page, right? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1476.64s)]
*  If like we can't look this up on stat head on basketball reference, but it's like who, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1485.12s)]
*  who has the lowest points per game who carries himself like an alpha, he might be in the running. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1490.16s)]
*  Well, look, he's 35 years old. It's 2025. And in the first round of the playoffs, he stood up [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1495.12s)]
*  the Houston Rockets best player who has a massive height and weight advantage on him [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1503.1999999999998s)]
*  in the most important possession of maybe the entire series, stood him up, played impeccable [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1508.6399999999999s)]
*  defense, forced to miss, let everyone know about it and let everyone know like, Hey, I'm 35. I'm old [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1514.2399999999998s)]
*  now. Don't come at me like that. Go somewhere else on your crunch time possessions. You may have [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1520.08s)]
*  a dog. I do was like, he's been sensational for the funny if he made doco was like, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1524.32s)]
*  have you seen the other guys on my team? Where else was that going to go? [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1529.76s)]
*  Was it going to be the Fred Van Vliet step back? Like what were my other options? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1535.04s)]
*  Fred was rolling and Jalen Green was on the bench. So I was watching him on that. I was [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1541.04s)]
*  actually watching Jalen Green on the bench because I was doing the body language. Dr. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1545.2s)]
*  Thing. I'd like to stay engaged. He was engaged. He was engaged. He was engaged. He may with four [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1548.56s)]
*  seconds left at no timeouts, leaving Adams and Shangoone out there for the scramble three situation [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1554.48s)]
*  was incredible. I don't know if he just passed out. I would have dusted off Reed Shepard [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1561.12s)]
*  and just been like, can you just do a Peyton Pritchard impersonation? I know you haven't [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1566.48s)]
*  played all series. I gotta say, I don't want to plant bad seeds in your head or make this about [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1569.9199999999998s)]
*  the Celtics. Peyton Pritchard's on a little cold streak on a half court to a little cold streak. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1575.2s)]
*  He's like, oh, for his last 60. Well, the other 30 to 60 footers aren't falling anymore. Like [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1579.28s)]
*  they were less less playoffs when it became like the other team knows it's coming. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1583.92s)]
*  Going back to the amplifier thing and what you said about how unique Draymond is, if you take [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1589.44s)]
*  all the other best amplifiers, I don't think any of them work as well as he works with the [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1594.48s)]
*  words because of the passing and the four and three stuff. Like if you just put Ben Wallace [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1599.68s)]
*  on the Warriors, let's take that five year Ben Wallace run and make it 10 years. And they would [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1603.2s)]
*  have been better from a rebounding standpoint. Defense, I'm not sure he would have been able [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1608.72s)]
*  to guard as many types of guys that Draymond guard, but he was an incredible defensive player [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1615.44s)]
*  there. And you don't really get anything else and you get terrible foul shooting and you start [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1620.8s)]
*  listing like, oh, well you also get this and like that doesn't work. I can't even think of anybody [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1627.28s)]
*  else I would put in. Can you? It's almost like Kartenstein, but a more play makey version of him, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1632.08s)]
*  but for 10 years. The passing is, is what makes it sing on offense and just like, you know, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1641.6799999999998s)]
*  you go back and watch prime Draymond Green defend James Harden as like sometimes the primary [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1649.12s)]
*  assignment often on switch. You're like, oh, is he the best guy on the Warriors at defending this guy [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1654.72s)]
*  and also the best guy on the Warriors years later at defending Jokic? Like that's, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1660.4s)]
*  that's a, that's a unicorn. Well, doesn't it like the 17 Warriors, which I think have a real case, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1665.92s)]
*  especially as the years pass for best team. I don't know if I'd vote for them, but I think [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1671.68s)]
*  they have a case. And one of the cases is when you're putting out Draymond and Nguidala and Clay, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1677.3600000000001s)]
*  who was a really, really good defender in the mid 2000s. You have those three guys out there at the [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1682.8000000000002s)]
*  same time with Curry and then Durant as the six foot 11 Spider-Man can protect the rim and do all [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1688.72s)]
*  these different things. That was, that might be the best five man lineup I've seen in person. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1695.2s)]
*  Even the Bulls always had somebody who was a little bit iffy on the movie poster, you know? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1702.0s)]
*  Yes. Steph, Clay, Nguidala, Draymond, Durant. I don't know if we're doing better than that. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1708.72s)]
*  Well, I mean, I remember being at a, in Denver at a Nuggets Warriors game pretty early that season. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1715.36s)]
*  Might've been the season. I don't know. Some, it was sometime in that 17 or, and or 17, 18. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1722.6399999999999s)]
*  And they did the thing where they were all on the floor together in the third quarter of the game. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1728.24s)]
*  And it was just, you didn't even understand what it was. Just like a title wave and you, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1732.6399999999999s)]
*  it was like you lost consciousness watching the game and it just became this blur of noise and [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1739.1999999999998s)]
*  sound and like blue jerseys flying around. And all of a sudden it was, they had put up like a 22 to [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1744.32s)]
*  two run in two and a half minutes. I mean, I'm exaggerating a little bit, but you just, it felt [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1749.04s)]
*  like watching the cyclone and good teams, the Nuggets were a good team. We're just looking [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1753.76s)]
*  around like, I don't even understand what's happening to us. Like, what are we supposed to [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1760.6399999999999s)]
*  do? Where's the ball? That guy is, that guy, it was like unbelievable. Well, it was too much talent, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1764.3999999999999s)]
*  which everybody knew when they got him. It was like, okay, well, this is a wrap for a couple of [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1769.2s)]
*  years. They broke the 2017 calves. And now as the years pass, it seems like the calves were like [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1772.4s)]
*  the underdog and the relationship. Meanwhile, they won the lottery three out of four years. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1778.5600000000002s)]
*  They had Kyrie Irving, they traded a number one pick for Kevin Love. They had all these expensive [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1783.68s)]
*  role players like Tristan Thompson. I think they had what, one of the five biggest payrolls in the [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1789.92s)]
*  league and they had LeBron James still in his prime. Like that was not, that was not Hickory High [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1794.48s)]
*  trying to, trying to make it through the tournament in Indiana in 1954. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1799.68s)]
*  The 2017 calves are the best calves team of LeBron's two times in Cleveland. The team that [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1803.5200000000002s)]
*  lost in the finals that year, in my opinion, that was the best Cleveland team. What's the best [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1810.64s)]
*  LeBron team to you? Tangent. I think 13 Heat are going to be tough to beat. Whatever, that was the [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1813.68s)]
*  Heat team that had the 20 something game winning streak. And they, they ran into some issues in the [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1822.64s)]
*  playoffs that I thought were a little bit frankly beneath them. I thought they should [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1826.4s)]
*  had an easier time in the East playoffs and then they beat the Spurs. I think, I mean, 17 calves [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1829.2s)]
*  didn't win. 16 calves will always be another measuring stick team. I'm going blind. I haven't [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1835.0400000000002s)]
*  looked back at the numbers of what that six, some of those teams, this Cleveland 2.0 teams, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1841.52s)]
*  as you know, as an Eastern Conference basketball fan, kind of just cruise through parts of the [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1847.1200000000001s)]
*  regular season. Conference was terrible. I think the first, maybe two thirds of that 2013 Miami [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1852.4s)]
*  season is the answer. But when they got to the playoffs, it wasn't just like that it got a little [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1859.0400000000002s)]
*  rocky with them. I thought Wade, that was when he really started to break down a little bit and he [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1864.16s)]
*  just didn't feel like Dwayne Wade in the same way anymore. Indiana took them to seven that year and he was like, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1870.5600000000002s)]
*  I just don't feel like this Pacers team should be taking these guys to seven. I do think the streak, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1874.0800000000002s)]
*  which was just great. I think the streak had a little do with that. I think it took a lot out [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1880.48s)]
*  of those guys, but I would say 2013. I also think hard to say with COVID, what happens in that 20 [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1885.3600000000001s)]
*  season. But if you look back at the guys on that team, it's pretty good team. You know, we have [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1892.96s)]
*  LeBron, you have Davis who's in his late twenties. You got Caruso in there. You have Caldwell Pope. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1898.8s)]
*  You have Kuzma before he kind of went off the rails. And by the way, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1905.4399999999998s)]
*  Dwight Howard protecting the rim. That team was talented. Relevant to this discussion. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1908.9599999999998s)]
*  Where are the Warriors at that time? The 20, well, that was the year that was the Durant Clay combo [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1913.6s)]
*  injury. Durant leaves and Clay. Which is why, you know, and they get three shots in the lottery [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1919.6s)]
*  during their sort of down period. You know, Kaminga, Wiseman, Moody, the payoff has not been [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1928.72s)]
*  substantial. I like Moody. I'll buy your Moody stock right now. No, no, I like, I like Moody a [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1937.04s)]
*  lot. I've been on the- It seems like you want them to put it for sale. No, no, no. I'm just, they, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1941.52s)]
*  I think obviously the Wiseman thing is a huge bust. Well, but that was also a COVID draft. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1945.28s)]
*  Like I got to defend them a tiny bit on that. That draft, you go back in that draft, that draft is [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1950.96s)]
*  bonkers. Though Kaminga is less defensible. I don't even care. And Kaminga, they got in a [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1955.12s)]
*  masterstroke trade selling as high as possible on D'Angelo Russell. But that should have been [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1960.1599999999999s)]
*  Franz. How did they not know to take the IQ six foot nine before the guys? My point is this. That's why [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1964.7199999999998s)]
*  you know it when you see it. Certain NBA championships just mean more than other [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1973.9199999999998s)]
*  NBA championships. Sometimes it's because of a star player finally winning one in his home [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1978.8s)]
*  city like Dirk in 2011. Sometimes it's everything magical comes together for some unexpected team. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1983.44s)]
*  Sometimes it's a team sort of stamping itself like a prior champion sort of proving like, [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1989.68s)]
*  yeah, the first one was legit. The 2022 Warriors Championship is one of those more special than a [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=1996.8s)]
*  lot of other championship championships because a lot of time had passed since the last Durant one. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2002.0800000000002s)]
*  It didn't feel all that likely that they would get back to the mountaintop. If you look back, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2008.24s)]
*  it's a strange roster of dudes, many of whom are not there anymore. Clay, Poole, Wiggins. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2013.92s)]
*  Also Clay and Draymond at weird points of their career where we weren't even sure if they were [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2019.68s)]
*  elite guys anymore or not. And they are taking advantage of this interregnum in the West where [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2024.4s)]
*  the Nuggets are in a waiting period for their guys like Murray and Porter to get back healthy. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2029.92s)]
*  The Clippers are never healthy and now they are healthy. But they were like, that was a legit [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2033.8400000000001s)]
*  awesome Warriors team that leaned back into the style of basketball that Steve Kerr wants to play, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2039.28s)]
*  the beautiful game, the ball movement, and had enough to squeeze out for a series against teams [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2045.68s)]
*  that just kind of weren't ready for all of it. Yeah. And the game four, I'm with you. That one [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2051.36s)]
*  meant so much to the kind of Steph career resume, all that stuff. But also it seemed like they were [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2058.8s)]
*  never going to be in that situation again. You didn't even mention the Suns. That was another one [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2066.0s)]
*  for the Suns coming off the finals. They were, what were they like 50 and six at one point, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2070.24s)]
*  just seeming like they're heading back and then just falling apart against Dallas. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2076.4s)]
*  Game seven, no, but now we're really off track, but game seven, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2081.44s)]
*  Dallas Phoenix and game seven, Boston, Milwaukee were the same day that year. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2084.88s)]
*  Oh my God, you're right. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2091.12s)]
*  And I was traveling to Chicago for the combine and my flight was like so poorly timed. Like it took [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2092.4s)]
*  off in the middle of the third quarter of Celtics bucks. And then it was going to land and Suns [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2098.6400000000003s)]
*  Mavs would already be, you know, first quarter, second quarter. I was like, I'm going to miss [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2105.6000000000004s)]
*  like so much. And I land and it's like Celtics win by a lot. Grant Williams makes a million threes. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2109.84s)]
*  And then I get to my hotel and I load up the Suns Mavs game. I'm like, what? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2116.32s)]
*  And it's over. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2120.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't even have to watch this thing. This is crazy. What the hell is going on? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2121.04s)]
*  And that warriors win the title. And Draymond is really good. End of story. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2125.2s)]
*  What's, uh, let's take a quick break. Hey, it's NBA playoff time. Get in on the action with [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2129.04s)]

*  gold state Houston, the generational defensive belt, which I'm not, I'm not going to subject you to [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2261.04s)]
*  all the names since bill Russell, I did make a list. Okay. But I think Draymond versus Rudy, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2268.08s)]
*  basically for the post-Kawhi era, which is about the moment he steps on Zaza's foot [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2276.48s)]
*  all the way through is the argument for the last eight years. I would say Draymond, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2281.44s)]
*  there's some nerds out there that would, that would be resolute about go bear and the go bear [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2287.68s)]
*  rim protection stats. Go bear has more defensive player of the years. Um, I think he's had more [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2292.48s)]
*  season to season probably success, but that's the argument for the last eight years. Dray, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2299.52s)]
*  if you're going to pick one guy who has the belt, it's those two. I think he's going to be the shack [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2305.6s)]
*  is the MVPs. What Draymond is to defensive player of the year, or like on a larger scale, even [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2312.08s)]
*  Jordan to MVPs, like we're all going to look back at the career, but like he only won one and these [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2318.16s)]
*  other guys won more than that. Like he's a, it's sometimes it's like, it's a regular season award. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2322.88s)]
*  He misses time. He gets whatever, like he gets injured. The team is so good. It doesn't even [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2327.52s)]
*  matter. Go bear is playing 82 game, but we all know it goes back to something Draymond himself said, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2331.52s)]
*  62 82 game player or 16 game player. He's a better 16 game player on defense alone. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2337.76s)]
*  You're just taking him in any postseason. You're always taking, he's a better 16 game defender. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2344.7200000000003s)]
*  Then we do go bear a 16 game, four series, four different kinds of opponents. He's better. And [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2349.6000000000004s)]
*  unfortunately for him, the belt is now going to be in San Antonio for a very long time. So Steve [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2354.7200000000003s)]
*  Kerr said Draymond was the single best defensive player he's ever seen after game four. And he's [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2361.76s)]
*  been touting Draymond's defense a lot. He actually lobbied for him for defensive player of the year, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2366.48s)]
*  which he doesn't, he's not a big award lobbyer. That's Steve Kerr, but [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2371.84s)]
*  he played with Scottie Pippen and he played with Dennis Rodman and Tim Duncan. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2376.96s)]
*  I was just surprised and Tim Duncan, but I mean Pippen, that's a tough one. I would love to [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2381.44s)]
*  put like three drinks into Steve Kerr 10 years from now and he's not coaching Draymond anymore [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2388.48s)]
*  and actually get the actual answer for is Draymond actually the best defensive player. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2392.8s)]
*  It's all a matter of, I mean, defense is still statistically sort of harder to parse than offense. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2397.6800000000003s)]
*  Sometimes when you're at this level, it becomes a matter of taste. Like Garnett should be in the [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2407.76s)]
*  conversation, Olajuwon, you know, whoever, we can go through all the greatest defenders in NBA history. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2411.6800000000003s)]
*  He's in the conversation. That's where Draymond Green is. Whether you think he's the best, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2418.0800000000004s)]
*  the fifth best, the fourth best, the third best, whatever he, that's where he lives in this conversation. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2421.76s)]
*  Are you taunting me to do my belt lineage? It feels like you are. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2425.5200000000004s)]
*  It was Draymond versus Rudy. So we're both going to say Draymond. Kawhi by himself. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2431.28s)]
*  By the way, I thought of you when I was at that Clipper game Saturday [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2438.96s)]
*  and Kawhi just took the ball from Jamal Murray. Hey, it's at half court. How about I just go take it? [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2442.0s)]
*  I'm going to take the ball now. Jamal's like, wait, you can't take the ball. I said, no, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2446.5600000000004s)]
*  I'm going to actually take it. Thanks for participating in my exercise. I'm just going to [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2450.08s)]
*  take it. Every time he does that, I thank you. I think Dwight Howard's in there for a while. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2454.48s)]
*  I'd have to look back at who's contemporary with who, who's old, who's young, but he's got, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2462.48s)]
*  certainly was there, many time defense player of the year. 08KG, I think has the belt by himself [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2466.3199999999997s)]
*  before him, Ben Wallace. And then it's a three headed battle for a while between Tim Duncan, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2472.08s)]
*  Kevin Garnett and Rashid Wallace, who I think has been lost in history now. But Rashid Wallace was [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2479.28s)]
*  just an awesome defensive player when they decided to put him next to Ben Wallace that, and people [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2486.88s)]
*  still seem to think that Laker series was like, Whoa, that was weird. It's like Detroit killed [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2492.6400000000003s)]
*  them in that series. Anyway, but have them. Then there's like a GP versus Matumbo mid to late 90s [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2497.2000000000003s)]
*  kind of argument, which I'd probably, I don't even know where I land. I'd probably default [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2504.64s)]
*  toward GP for a little bit. There's a Hakeem Robinson before that. Then we have, I won't [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2511.2s)]
*  entertain Hakeem Robinson. I won't entertain it. I would pick Hakeem, right? It's Hakeem. I'm not [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2519.92s)]
*  entertaining. I'm just saying that Robinson won defense support of the year a couple of times, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2524.8799999999997s)]
*  but he's very, he, he, Admiral was incredible. He's a dream teamer. That did what happened in [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2528.64s)]
*  the playoffs in 1995. It just tried the rest of it is irrelevant. Hakeem also the block steal stuff. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2534.08s)]
*  That was one of my book. I made up the word stocks because it was like, there was just nothing like [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2541.52s)]
*  this guy putting up basically like seven blocks and steals a game. Pippen versus Robin was another [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2546.0s)]
*  one. And then, then it starts getting harder after that, but I did want to shout out Bobby Jones. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2551.52s)]
*  Um, I have another Jem on thing for you really quick. So from 2015 through 2025, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2556.0s)]
*  he did not average 10 points a game, 9.6 points a game, 7.5 rebounds and 6.6 assists. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2566.56s)]
*  Those are cumulative for those seasons. Those are his per game averages for like 11 years, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2576.6400000000003s)]
*  46% field goal, 32% from three. Um, in the playoffs that bumps up to basically 12, nine and six. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2581.84s)]
*  Um, but I was like, wow, that's weird. I wonder if anyone has anything remotely that looks like that. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2590.5600000000004s)]
*  So I rig basketball reference.com who averaged nine points or less. You didn't go stat news. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2596.0s)]
*  You didn't go stat news. No stat news. I don't try. Brussels and I hate stat news. We don't [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2603.28s)]
*  Alex Ovechkin, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2607.2s)]
*  under nine points over five assists and then rebounds, whatever. Okay. Everyone else is a [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2611.7599999999998s)]
*  guard. It's like Jose Calderon, Avery Johnson, Muggsy Bogues, Dick McGuire, Nate McMillan, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2620.8799999999997s)]
*  Eric Snow, Brevin Knight, TJ McConnell, Roy Sproul. This is like guys who played 600 games or more. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2627.12s)]
*  And Draymond has way more rebounds than native mob, obviously, but there's like, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2632.72s)]
*  you can't even basketball reference is like, I don't know what to make of this. Like who are, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2637.04s)]
*  I don't know. You got me. And not included in any of that search data is can defend every position [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2642.0s)]
*  on the floor, including seven foot centers, uh, which Avery Johnson or Jose Calderon. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2647.36s)]
*  I wonder if they should add like almost like in chess where you have in what's an ELO score for [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2653.6s)]
*  chess. I almost wonder if basketball reference to just, just randomly assigned ELO scores [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2658.24s)]
*  defensively for every player. Like Draymond would be like, what, like a 97? Whatever the highest is [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2664.16s)]
*  you give them a hundred. I don't know. Is that where ELO, I don't feel like bill Russell has [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2670.64s)]
*  to be a hundred. Can we have multi, we can only have one a hundred. Yeah. I think Russell's the [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2675.4399999999996s)]
*  only hundred. Okay. Um, yeah. So that's, that's basically all my Draymond stuff other than [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2681.2s)]
*  I don't know how much longer this goes. There's a weird, they've done a lot about this this year, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2688.3199999999997s)]
*  next year, the contracts are aligned. This is our last dance. I don't know if I'd necessarily [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2693.2799999999997s)]
*  believe that, but what's been cool is watching Butler and Draymond and that play yesterday was [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2697.7599999999998s)]
*  like Draymond, like they're going to go to Shengu and I'm going to stop him. And Jimmy's like, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2702.3199999999997s)]
*  and I'm going to get the rebound. And then Jimmy comes flying in. He probably has what, like 10 [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2707.7599999999998s)]
*  pounds of Toradel shot in his ass at that point. And it's starting to wear off and he comes flying [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2712.9599999999996s)]
*  in and gets the ultimate Jimmy Butler in traffic rebound, holds the ball, protects it, gets fouled. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2718.0s)]
*  Then he's like, that was my rebound. That was my rebound. Like the combo of those two guys, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2723.6s)]
*  they're both insane. The rebound. Well, Draymond does what he does. He stands up Shengu and [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2727.76s)]
*  forces a 14 footer when it should have been a nine footer. You know, exactly. He's done it a [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2735.04s)]
*  billion times. That's what he does. Jimmy Butler is 35 going on 36 injured. And even when not injured [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2739.04s)]
*  is like a below the rim old man kind of player now. And I mean, that is a compliment. He's [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2747.44s)]
*  smart. He cuts, he hits people, he knows what to do, but he's not a high flyer. Never really was, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2752.32s)]
*  but certainly is it now that rebound had the feel I watched it like five times this morning. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2757.1200000000003s)]
*  And had the feel of it had the feel of like, this is everything I have left in my body at the end of [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2762.2400000000002s)]
*  this game is pouring in to jumping as high as I can with as much force as I can because Steven [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2769.1200000000003s)]
*  Adams is under there. And I know what Steven Adams is, is an offensive rebounder. It was one [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2776.16s)]
*  of those great athletic sports moments of like digging deep and all the cliches we talked about [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2780.3199999999997s)]
*  that rebound is like, he's not jumping that high again, probably for the entire rest of the [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2785.52s)]
*  playoffs as long as Golden State goes on. That was like, this is everything I got. If this game goes [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2790.24s)]
*  to overtime, I'm going to feel the pain of this jump for the rest of this game, but I got to get [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2795.92s)]
*  this rebound. Well, I thought the Rockets were going to win last night. I wasn't expecting the [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2799.7599999999998s)]
*  Jalen Green stink bomb, but they did get a crazy Van Bleek game. But it came down to the fear. If [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2805.84s)]
*  you were taking the Rockets in this series, the fear was what's going to happen late in games when [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2813.04s)]
*  both teams have to execute. How is this going to play out? And it executed, it happened the way it [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2818.2400000000002s)]
*  happened. The reason I thought the Rockets were going to win because I didn't think Steph was [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2822.96s)]
*  going to have a big game because they, he put out so much on Saturday night. I was like, well, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2826.0s)]
*  they're not getting that again. And Butler's hurt. How are they going to get to a hundred points? [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2831.52s)]
*  I didn't realize Dylan Brooks was going to talk shit to Butler and just activate playoff Jimmy. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2837.12s)]
*  And now it just feels like the Rockets are going sideways and we're just going to wait for the [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2843.7599999999998s)]
*  honest trade now. Trade machine summer. This is a Draymond Green segment. Should we talk about [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2848.56s)]
*  that Draymond Green was like on the verge of getting ejected? I don't say he was on the [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2855.92s)]
*  verge of getting ejected in that game, but the technical, a flagrant and the Tari Easton thing [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2860.64s)]
*  where he rolled over him and tried to go to his foot, hit his neck. Like, I, I'm watching that. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2865.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm like, they could throw them out of the game for this. Like I, he's going to, it is maybe an [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2873.7599999999998s)]
*  accident. It looks like an accident. It can be plausibly explained away as an accident. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2879.7599999999998s)]
*  But the thing about Draymond Green's accidents, and there are a lot of them, is that it never [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2883.68s)]
*  feels as if he's trying to calm the accident or restrain his limbs from moving in ways that will [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2889.52s)]
*  accelerate and worsen the accident. It's always like, my legs are doing this. You're in the way. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2896.16s)]
*  My legs are going to keep doing this. I'm not going to try to stop my legs. My legs are doing [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2901.28s)]
*  what they're doing. And if your head's in the way, your head's in the way. Right. And there's been [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2905.36s)]
*  other guys over the years like that too. Like remember when Ron Artest just elbowed James [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2909.68s)]
*  Harden the head and basically knocked him out. And I don't think it was intentional, but I also [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2914.0s)]
*  think it was the same thing. It was like, Hey, my elbow needed to go forward. And that guy's head [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2919.84s)]
*  happened to be in the way and I had to do it. Some guys bowing, it was never an accident. I never [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2924.4s)]
*  felt like it was maybe a partial accident, but he would kick his, what was that? He kicked somebody [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2930.2400000000002s)]
*  in the face running by a three that time. Remember? I can't remember who it was. He just like, [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2935.36s)]
*  we kicked them right in the face. And they're reviewing the play. And I'm like, it doesn't [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2940.0s)]
*  really, it looks mostly like an accident. It also doesn't really look good. He already has a technical. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2945.36s)]
*  He's always seems to have a technical. And as you well know, Draymond Green with a technical [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2952.8s)]
*  is like a superhero. He's impervious to technical number two for the most. He could do whatever he [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2958.88s)]
*  wants. Draymond with five fouls is the other one. Like he had five fouls yesterday, felt like for an [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2964.16s)]
*  hour and he's just doing the vertical stop and everybody had never gets the six foul. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2968.64s)]
*  It's pretty crazy. He's still, he's still a genius. He had a player earlier in this series. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2973.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't remember who he was guarding, but somebody for the Rockets had the ball at the elbow [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2979.92s)]
*  and went to pass to somebody Draymond. It was Draymond's guy. I had the ball at the elbow [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2985.12s)]
*  and he went to pass to a cutter and Draymond like did the thing where he read his mind. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2989.92s)]
*  And it was like almost as if he was ahead of the pass. He starts drifting away from his own guy [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=2995.6s)]
*  and the pass comes and it's essentially a pass to Draymond because Draymond has anticipated [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3002.8s)]
*  out anticipated the guy who's actually initiating the action and he passes the ball and Draymond's [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3007.76s)]
*  just there. And it's like, what's this? What's this? He just like, is it's not even just in sync [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3013.12s)]
*  with the ball. He's ahead of the ball. He still makes those plays. Every game does that. And I [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3018.16s)]
*  notice that every time I'm in person and Saturday was at another level is Sam Sam Hauser. No, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3022.88s)]
*  Yokich. Oh, I just like to me, there's so many litmus tests for how many, how much people are [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3028.4s)]
*  actually watching basketball. And one of them is if somebody tries to tell me Yokich is like a shitty [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3037.36s)]
*  defensive player, it's like, go fucking watch him in person. Just blow up plays. Just be like, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3041.52s)]
*  are you going to do that? I'm going to dive right as you're about to do that pass. Now you're [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3047.04s)]
*  jumping in the air because you thought you had that guy and now you're like just kind of throwing [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3050.8s)]
*  it over your head. He, he's spooky how he can reach it. He had a pass after the game three [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3055.1200000000003s)]
*  where they doubled them at the top, the top of the key. Chris Dunn was in the corner on Christian [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3066.0s)]
*  Brown and he kind of leaked over and Yoko just facing the other way like this. And Christian [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3071.84s)]
*  Brown is behind him this way. Chris Dunn comes over. He feels Chris Dunn and just whips the [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3076.96s)]
*  past of Christian Brown. Like that's his signature. You're like, he, how does he, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3085.6s)]
*  there's 10 seconds where you don't know he's there. How did you know he was there? No idea. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3090.48s)]
*  That might be one of his, that is one of his signature passes. And I've watched dozens of them [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3095.28s)]
*  at this point. And sometimes I go back and I rewind it and I'm like, let me try to find [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3101.52s)]
*  how last time that he made eye contact that his head was facing the direction of the player he [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3107.44s)]
*  ends up passing to. And sometimes you just can't find it. Like there's a defensive rebound. He has [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3113.12s)]
*  the ball. He's looking over here and then the pass comes. You're like, I don't, I don't really, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3118.32s)]
*  well, what was crazy about that play was he didn't know it was Chris Dunn who was coming over to [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3122.48s)]
*  double him. So he had to also know instinctively Chris Dunn is coming over to double me, even [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3127.36s)]
*  though I can't see him. And then when he does that, it's like some fucking star wars shit. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3133.28s)]
*  When they put the helmet on Luke Skywalker and they're like, Luke, just use the force. Like he [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3137.76s)]
*  can do that. Well, it's fitting that we're talking about Yokocho's passing and Draymond's defense in [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3143.76s)]
*  the same breath, because that's about, that's about right. I think this has been an awesome [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3149.0400000000004s)]
*  basketball round of, of, of games. And we don't even, we didn't know what's going to happen in [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3154.08s)]
*  these four that are about to happen. Quickly Golden state, who do you think you think they'd [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3158.72s)]
*  much rather play the Lakers or kind of would rather play the Lakers or wouldn't really want to play [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3164.88s)]
*  either if you had to guess, assuming they get there. We're definitely at the stage of the Western [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3170.4s)]
*  conference playoffs where it's just, okay, well that path sucks. That path sucks. That path really [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3174.56s)]
*  sucks. I would say given the fact that JJ Reddick just played the same five guys for an entire half [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3180.48s)]
*  of basketball and they looked gassed at the end and one of them is 40 and they don't have the Anthony [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3188.48s)]
*  Davis piece that kind of troubled the warriors. I would say the Lakers are probably a better matchup. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3194.64s)]
*  The warriors would probably prefer to play the Lakers a little bit because just Minnesota, [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3201.76s)]
*  especially from four weeks ago when they went head to head. Big, nasty. And I mean, but it's [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3205.92s)]
*  no picnic playing Luca. You look at Luca LeBron or like, I'm really picking that team. But I think [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3211.6000000000004s)]
*  given the respective states of the teams, I think I would pick, if I were the worries, [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3216.2400000000002s)]
*  I'd say kind of rather play the Lakers. Yeah. And plus there's the Edwards. How real is this? [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3219.92s)]
*  This is last year. So here it is. Anthony Edwards has joined the party. He's now a superstar. And [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3225.84s)]
*  this year there's now this next step that might be happening. I don't want to jinx it, [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3232.56s)]
*  but I think he's at the party. He's at the party for you. Yeah. He's at the party. If you're [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3238.0s)]
*  starting a franchise right now, I want to do first tech second, because I think I saw this today. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3243.68s)]
*  Would you, would you rather have Luca or Anthony Edwards next five years? [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3247.84s)]
*  Cause I think I'd rather have Edwards. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3255.04s)]
*  That's crazy. Yeah. Next five years. I think I'd still take Luca. Yeah. Cause you're getting [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3256.48s)]
*  great choice by the way. Can't lose with Luca. You're at least getting the, what if he shows up [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3267.52s)]
*  on a mission this year piece like Shaq for those three, four years with Shaq in the late nineties. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3272.72s)]
*  Or it's like, what if he takes this seriously one season? Now we're supposed to pretend that [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3278.56s)]
*  never happened. Okay. And then no chance Lakers come back kind of a chance, sort of a chance, [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3283.12s)]
*  or you feel like that was their desperation. If you have home court for five and potentially [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3289.52s)]
*  seven, you got a chance. I would be surprised if they came back. I would be surprised if this got [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3294.24s)]
*  to seven. I would be surprised if it got to seven. I just think you gas out your team like that. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3299.68s)]
*  You've sent a message to the team. Like we got to win this game. You don't win it. Minnesota's [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3304.4s)]
*  hungry. They're young and they're fresh. I would be surprised if it got back to seven. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3308.56s)]
*  You know what they need to do? Hope that Anthony Edwards goes into, I got this mode. Like they're [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3313.12s)]
*  going to probably win game five because they'll get every call game six. You hope for some hero [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3317.36s)]
*  ball from Edwards. You hope for the Tom Thibodeau doc game seven, 2010 final strategy of let's try [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3322.7999999999997s)]
*  to, let's try to use Edwards's desire to be the hero against him and maybe just hope he makes some [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3329.2s)]
*  bad shots and kind of shoots them out of the game. I think he also could just dunk you into [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3336.48s)]
*  pieces and end your season very quickly. He's certainly unafraid. Zach Lowe, I was, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3343.12s)]
*  we ran out of time. I was going to ask you to rank your favorite ringer people, [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3349.44s)]
*  but we can do that the next time. Oh, that's a spicy one. Another time. Yeah. Another time. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3352.64s)]
*  Podcast for you on Thursday. Yes. Good to see you. Coming off two good games Wednesday. Yeah. Good [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3357.68s)]
*  to see you my friend. Always fun. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CUk3Kp-wo&t=3362.48s)]
