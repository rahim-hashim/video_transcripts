# Milwaukee’s Crazy and Other NBA Summer Takeaways | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=0.0s)]
*  So after nine o'clock on Wednesday morning, Rob Mahoney is here. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=26.2s)]
*  I have, I've been, I'm bristling Rob so many, I'm like a volcano. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=30.04s)]
*  I'm just about to spout lava of NBA takes. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=34.28s)]
*  You were able to get some off on the render NBA show a couple of days ago. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=38.44s)]
*  Um, I figured I could facilitate for you today. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  I can be the Derek white to your Luca Garza and you can just Jack threes all [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  pod long in one leg and follow us. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=50.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=52.56s)]
*  Like a Lonzo ball coming in, just trying to fit in as everybody else gets shots. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=53.64s)]
*  I have a big, I have a dozen, 12 thoughts on big picture, all this stuff that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=58.6s)]
*  happened in the last few days. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=65.28s)]
*  And I'm going to start here because you didn't get to talk about this on the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=66.92s)]
*  ringer NBA show because it happened afterwards. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=70.52000000000001s)]
*  I thought what Milwaukee did was one of the most desperate, reckless moves that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=73.4s)]
*  I could ever remember since I've been a basketball fan. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=79.84s)]
*  I hated it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=82.16s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=83.36s)]
*  I think it's a disaster. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=85.0s)]
*  Um, I didn't approve of any single aspect of it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=86.88s)]
*  Carrying the damn stretch thing for five years. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=90.28s)]
*  Idiotic doing it for miles Turner. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=94.0s)]
*  I have no idea why they would do that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=97.44s)]
*  I just don't understand why they wouldn't have just traded Yonis. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=99.52s)]
*  If it's this desperate that you're going to pay for the next four years, 47 [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=102.52s)]
*  million, 49 million, 50 million and 51 million for miles Turner. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=107.52s)]
*  Yep. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=112.28s)]
*  And then on top of that, another 22 in the fifth year when he's not even on the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=113.36s)]
*  team, if that's the only recourse you have, if that's how desperate you are to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=116.96s)]
*  keep Yonis, I'm trading Yonis at that point. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=121.32s)]
*  I'm, I'm, I'm folding my hand and I don't, I just don't get it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  This doesn't make them a top four team in the East. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=128.96s)]
*  I'm only doing this if I'm a top four team in the East and I'm not. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=131.8s)]
*  So why am I doing this? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=134.88s)]
*  Counterpoint their future without Yonis is already cooked. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=137.44s)]
*  Like this is a team that's going to be so bad in the short term. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=141.48s)]
*  If they do trade him, even if they get back really good players, even if they [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=144.2s)]
*  get back like good competitive players or good young prospects, like I think [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=147.07999999999998s)]
*  the outlook is dire enough that I can understand the logic of steering into [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  more dire, more risk, right? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=156.67999999999998s)]
*  Like over leveraging, putting the mortgage on the mortgage, all those things. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=158.6s)]
*  Like I get the logic, but I do think it's telling that through months, if not [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=161.68s)]
*  years of Yonis trade speculation and bucks, like couch GMing that we've been [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=167.4s)]
*  doing, trying to figure out what the outcome of all this was going to be. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=173.32000000000002s)]
*  I did not hear one person seriously suggest stretching Damian Lillard's contract. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=176.28s)]
*  Like that was never on the table and literally everything else was on the table. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  And so like this combination of moves is easily the one, two punch of like the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=185.72000000000003s)]
*  most surprising things to happen so far. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=189.88000000000002s)]
*  Like I just never would have imagined in a million years that Dame would get [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  stretched and that the bucks would have the flexibility to even sign someone [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=195.16s)]
*  like Miles Turner in the first place, regardless of whether you think it's a [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=198.52s)]
*  good fit or what you think of his game or any of that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=201.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=204.4s)]
*  But do you think, so they had Brooke Lopez, they just could have re-signed him, right? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=204.51999999999998s)]
*  He got two for 18 from the Clippers. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=207.84s)]
*  If they just paid, let's say they topped it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=210.72s)]
*  They were like, all right, two for 20, stick around for two more years. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=213.28s)]
*  Keep Dame. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=216.84s)]
*  So next year or this coming year, they would have been paying 60, let's say 61 [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=218.24s)]
*  for Lopez and Dame versus the 47 they're paying for Turner and Dame stretch. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=222.52s)]
*  So they say that's an extra 14 million. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=228.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=231.84s)]
*  So, so you basically say 14 million with this weird movie did. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=232.56s)]
*  I just don't think there's much of a difference with Lopez and Turner. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  I guess part of the problem is I don't like Miles Turner that much as an asset. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=241.08s)]
*  He's fine. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=245.16000000000003s)]
*  We, we saw him go through four rounds of the NBA playoffs. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=245.96s)]
*  He played big minutes. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=249.12s)]
*  Like he's clearly a playoff player, but I don't think he's like a missing piece for them. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=250.08s)]
*  And the, and the other pieces next year, Dame's and expiring, which would have given them, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=255.08s)]
*  or would have been an expiring, which would have given them so much more [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=260.0s)]
*  flexibility for moves and just things to do. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=263.0s)]
*  So you lose that too. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=266.16s)]
*  And you just, you just have the sunk cost now of every year. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  You're, you're just $22 million lower than you should be on the cap. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=271.04s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=276.8s)]
*  I, I, I, I was driving when I saw it and I did like, ah, it was like one of those. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=278.08s)]
*  Nobody stretches contracts of that size. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=284.44s)]
*  It's never happened. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=287.15999999999997s)]
*  This size, this amount of dead money, it's an unprecedented situation that the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=288.35999999999996s)]
*  bucks are putting themselves into. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=292.32s)]
*  I, again, it sounds like you liked it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=293.67999999999995s)]
*  I don't like it, but I understand why desperate teams do desperate things. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  And among the most desperate situations is when your superstar is on the brink of [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=300.23999999999995s)]
*  leaving or wanting out or doing something drastic in his own right. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=305.12s)]
*  And so like, I don't love the stretch. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=308.44s)]
*  I like the miles Turner move. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=310.68s)]
*  And here's the thing it accomplishes one thing and one thing only, and we're [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=312.56s)]
*  going to see if this is true or not. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=315.8s)]
*  Does it appease Yanis? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=317.52s)]
*  Does it make Yanis happy? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=318.88s)]
*  Does is it, is there something material about that change and that investment and [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=320.2s)]
*  that desperation that signals to him? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=324.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=326.76s)]
*  I want to come back and we're going to give this thing a try. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=327.15999999999997s)]
*  I want to see how this works. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=329.24s)]
*  And that to me is the biggest difference between miles Turner and Brooke Lopez. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=330.32s)]
*  I think one difference is Brooke Lopez just cannot be a 30 minute a game [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=334.84s)]
*  playoff guy anymore. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=339.79999999999995s)]
*  I think he's a really good regular season player still out. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=340.84s)]
*  Like it is that kind of situation. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=343.67999999999995s)]
*  Brooke Lopez as coming off the bench with the Clippers, amazing, great, great [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=345.47999999999996s)]
*  value on that deal. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=349.59999999999997s)]
*  Still a really good rim protector, but limited in his mobility clearly as [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=350.52s)]
*  basically every player is his age. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=354.4s)]
*  And so you're, you're trading for a guy who just simply cannot do that starting [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=356.59999999999997s)]
*  job at a high minutes rate anymore for a guy who we just saw do it, you know, up [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=360.64s)]
*  and ups and downs for miles Turner in the playoffs, certainly in the finals, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=364.88s)]
*  like really struggled with the shooting and you could see how teams like Oklahoma [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=367.84s)]
*  city, for example, really test him and really test his skillset, but you're [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=371.08s)]
*  getting a guy who is a proven playoff performer at this point in Turner and [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=375.32s)]
*  you're signaling something to Yanis. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=379.59999999999997s)]
*  And if those two things are enough to keep him happy and continue Milwaukee [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=381.32s)]
*  Bucks, like not business as usual, but that's kind of the problem is every [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=385.2s)]
*  other move they've made pretty much has been bringing back Gary Trent Jr. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=388.71999999999997s)]
*  Bring back Bobby Portis, you know, like bringing back Torian Prince. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=392.08s)]
*  If you were also going to bring back Brooke Lopez, then you're just last [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=395.59999999999997s)]
*  year's Bucks without Damian Lillard. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=399.76s)]
*  And that, that, that team is not going to be good enough and it's not going to be [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=401.4s)]
*  persuasive to Yanis in really any way. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=403.96s)]
*  But this is persuasive. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=406.76s)]
*  We're going to find out. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=408.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=409.24s)]
*  Yanis, Yanis stay here. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=410.0s)]
*  We have no future. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=412.36s)]
*  We've ruined our salary cap. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=414.28s)]
*  Like when you say it's desperate, there's levels of desperation. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=416.12s)]
*  Like if I was trying to impress Yanis and convince him he should stay here and [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=419.96s)]
*  I chopped off my thumb and it's like, here's how much I care. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=424.32s)]
*  It's still crazy to chop off your thumb, which is basically what this deal is. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=428.96s)]
*  I like Miles Turner more than Brooke Lopez. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=433.2s)]
*  I don't think it's significant enough that all the other stuff that comes with [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=435.68s)]
*  this deal, I just don't fully understand it. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=439.92s)]
*  And I still feel like throwing away that giant expiring was a better asset than [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=443.44s)]
*  the upgrade of, you know, just, Hey, Yanis, just wait, we feel like we're going to [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=448.16s)]
*  be able to trade Damian a year. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=453.36s)]
*  And by the way, they don't have to trade Yanis either. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=456.0s)]
*  I know he's a superstar. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=458.48s)]
*  I know he won the title, but it's, if he's like, I want out. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=459.44s)]
*  It doesn't mean you necessarily have to trade him if there's not a deal. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=462.52s)]
*  Um, I just felt what was really shocking to me. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=466.36s)]
*  And this goes to the second, the second thing that jumped out to me was [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=470.20000000000005s)]
*  Houston overstocking their roster, getting Phinney Smith and then getting [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=474.36s)]
*  Capella and it's like, huh, so I have three centers and you have Phinney [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=478.48s)]
*  Smith, but you also have Amen Thompson and you have Eason and you have Whitmore. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=484.24s)]
*  And you have all these wings. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=489.92s)]
*  It's not enough minutes for everybody. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=491.48s)]
*  Why are you doing this? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=494.40000000000003s)]
*  And it just felt like they were heading toward a three for one for Yanis [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=495.48s)]
*  and not telling us, right. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=498.44s)]
*  And then the Dame stretch happens. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=500.44s)]
*  And that was when I was like, I don't know what's happening anymore, but I, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=503.8s)]
*  so you think, you think Yanis is going to look at this and go, oh, you guys did it. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=506.84s)]
*  I wasn't sure if I wanted to stay, but now that we have miles Turner, now that [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=512.32s)]
*  we have no cow, now we have a bad cap situation, I guess I'll stay. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=517.48s)]
*  I think by everything Yanis has said and the way he has postured throughout all [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=522.64s)]
*  this is that he's looking, he's looking for a reason to stay. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=527.32s)]
*  Like he is looking for the validation to continue playing for the Bucks and being [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=530.7600000000001s)]
*  part of the next Bucks contender. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=534.84s)]
*  Like I think he just wants anything. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=536.08s)]
*  He wants some sign of life. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=538.24s)]
*  And maybe this is that, like again, this is something that nobody expected. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=540.2800000000001s)]
*  This is a level of flexibility and a caliber of player that I just did not think [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=543.7600000000001s)]
*  the Bucks were going to be able to add given their limited resources. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=547.7600000000001s)]
*  And they did something unprecedented. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=550.96s)]
*  They did something foolish and maybe insane in the process. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=553.36s)]
*  But like, since when do superstars care about the long-term implications of the [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=556.48s)]
*  moves that are made to appease them? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=560.8000000000001s)]
*  Like that's kind of part of the job. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=562.12s)]
*  That's how you get in trouble though. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=564.12s)]
*  Well, that's, that's how you stop thinking about long-term completely and trying to [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=565.44s)]
*  appease somebody hoping they'll stay. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=569.76s)]
*  Like, like this is whether you're in a relationship or a relationship with an [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=571.48s)]
*  NBA star, like this is the worst thing you can do for the Bucks. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=575.24s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=578.4s)]
*  For Yanis, like it's not really his concern. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=579.24s)]
*  What happens to the Bucks in 2031? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=582.04s)]
*  If he's not on the team anymore for him, it's like, what [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=583.96s)]
*  are we doing right now to make this a more appealing situation for me so that I want [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=586.32s)]
*  to play here? Like he's earned the right to look at it through that kind of framework. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=590.8000000000001s)]
*  This is the equivalent of our relationship isn't going well. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=595.08s)]
*  Let's have a kid. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=598.08s)]
*  Maybe it'll make it better. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=599.0s)]
*  That's, that's what this is. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=600.8000000000001s)]
*  And you go back to the Kuzma trade, which I also hated. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=602.24s)]
*  Yeah, that was getting the dog. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=604.96s)]
*  That was the trial run before you had the kid to save the relationship. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=606.32s)]
*  And not even just the dog. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=609.0400000000001s)]
*  It was like getting a Great Dane when you have a one bedroom apartment. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=610.08s)]
*  Ah, who cares? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=614.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=615.44s)]
*  Um, but you do that Kuzma thing and you have Middleton who would have been an [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=616.0s)]
*  expiring this year and you trade AJ Johnson, who actually might've had some, I don't [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=620.0s)]
*  know, modicum of trade value. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=625.12s)]
*  Um, so you do that and now you basically all in with Kuzma and Miles Turner and you [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=627.0799999999999s)]
*  have no trade flexibility anymore. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=633.16s)]
*  And this is your roster. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=634.9599999999999s)]
*  And I just don't get it. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=636.04s)]
*  I was, I even used, I use Google AI for the first time, Rob. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=637.0799999999999s)]
*  Really? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=640.92s)]
*  I've always been afraid to go down that corner because like it would make [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=641.24s)]
*  rewatchables prep way easier if I'm just like, Hey Google, tell me all the [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=644.92s)]
*  reasons, JAWS 2, blah, blah, blah. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=648.28s)]
*  I'm just going to do it. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=650.36s)]
*  Give me a bunch of fake information. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=650.9599999999999s)]
*  So about the making of JAWS 2. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=651.9599999999999s)]
*  I didn't want to go down that AI road, but I was racking my brain, trying to [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=653.88s)]
*  figure out a more desperate reckless move in the history of the league. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=658.0s)]
*  And I actually asked AI and it was suggesting stuff like the Chandler [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=661.12s)]
*  Parsons free agent contract and things like that. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=665.56s)]
*  And I was like, there's no way that comes close. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=667.9599999999999s)]
*  The two things I can think of, um, the Brooklyn Celtics trade, when they got [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=670.04s)]
*  Pierce and Garnett and they just threw in like that extra swap, like the [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=674.88s)]
*  picks, if you just made the picks, it made sense because they were also [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=681.4s)]
*  dumping Gerald Wallace, they were getting piercing Garnett back. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=684.28s)]
*  Like they were trying to win the title. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=687.76s)]
*  Everything was defensible until you got to like that extra [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=689.68s)]
*  swap and maybe one more pick. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=692.2s)]
*  Um, the other one, there was an Orlando moment that is a little reminiscent [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=694.68s)]
*  of this near the end of the Dwight Howard. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=699.24s)]
*  When it felt like the Dwight Howard situation was going to get a little [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=701.92s)]
*  gamey, he was going to be a free agent, I think after 2011 or 12, and they [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=705.0s)]
*  traded Richard Lewis for Gilbert arenas. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=709.92s)]
*  I was about to say, I know the Gilbert arenas drop is coming. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=712.8s)]
*  This is, that was really a moment in time. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=715.16s)]
*  So in the Richard Lewis, I think he had two years left, but you could buy out [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=717.36s)]
*  the second year for a price and Gilbert just had the three years left. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=721.3199999999999s)]
*  And it was one of those, Hey, Dwight, look, we got, we got Gilbert arenas. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=725.28s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=728.9599999999999s)]
*  Dwight didn't care because if the team's not that good, the [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=729.84s)]
*  star is going to move on anyway. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=734.08s)]
*  I just think, I personally think they should have just traded Yanis. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=735.64s)]
*  I just would have done it. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=739.2s)]
*  He won the title. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=740.0400000000001s)]
*  I think the Bucks fans would have been okay with it as much as I love [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=740.88s)]
*  stars finishing their career. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=744.32s)]
*  If he wanted to go, then you do it. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=745.64s)]
*  If he wants to stay, but he's like mutilate our team going forward, then [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=749.44s)]
*  that's not a reason to keep him. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=753.44s)]
*  I don't think, but we, um, it's interesting. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=755.08s)]
*  You're kind of like calfzagging. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=757.2800000000001s)]
*  I feel like you're testing out a zag here. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=759.08s)]
*  Look, I'm never going to full zag into setting $24 million on fire every year [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=760.88s)]
*  from your cap, like that's what it costs to execute this move is so dramatic [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=765.92s)]
*  that there's a reason basically no one else would do something like this [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=771.52s)]
*  other than the Bucks, but maybe to add to your list of desperation moves, like [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=774.2s)]
*  this is not the first time the Bucks have done something desperate. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=777.92s)]
*  This is a team that just threw like, I don't know, five second round [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=780.28s)]
*  picks at Nicole Amiritej. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=783.3199999999999s)]
*  It's the team that like traded a ton to get Drew Holiday in the first place. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=784.88s)]
*  Like they have been on this particular treadmill for a long time, trying [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=788.68s)]
*  to find finishing pieces, trying to find, you know, foundational pieces [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=792.4s)]
*  for the team around Yanis. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=795.68s)]
*  And this is where you end up when you do that for years, year after year after [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=796.92s)]
*  years, you don't have anything to trade. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=801.0s)]
*  And therefore you have to wave and stretch Damien Lillard just to [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=803.1999999999999s)]
*  make a move like this possible. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=806.28s)]
*  Cleveland was in this situation with LeBron in the late 2000s when it just [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=808.0s)]
*  became like a Jenga stack of bad moves. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=812.8s)]
*  And you're just like, Oh, this bad contract, I'll turn it into an even [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=815.12s)]
*  worse and they just, and it was all these named dudes on the wrong [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=818.52s)]
*  point of their careers. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=821.88s)]
*  This is to me worse. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=823.68s)]
*  And look, Yanis, I mean, he tried to pretend he was upset about this yesterday. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=825.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't think you do this move without running it by him. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=830.24s)]
*  I just don't. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=833.92s)]
*  Yeah, I just don't. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=834.88s)]
*  That's not how the league works. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=835.88s)]
*  This is such a dramatic move. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=837.1999999999999s)]
*  At some point you have to go, yo, if we got Miles Turner, it's going to have [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=839.8s)]
*  to cost us some shit is that we won't have Dame next year, right? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=844.04s)]
*  We're probably enough to get rid of him. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=847.48s)]
*  Is that, would that be cool with you? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=848.8s)]
*  So I just feel like he has to sign off. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=850.4399999999999s)]
*  If this bought you two years of Yanis, this full season and all of next season, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=852.8s)]
*  is that enough? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=858.36s)]
*  Is that enough to you? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=859.12s)]
*  Like if you knew he was going to be on board and a Milwaukee buck for two years, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=860.0s)]
*  is that enough? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=864.3199999999999s)]
*  I think I still would have traded him to Houston, but I think it's a valid point. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=870.6s)]
*  If he promised like, I will stay here for the next two years. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=876.24s)]
*  If you do this, I'm just, I'm still dubious that he was holding a gun to their heads. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=879.2s)]
*  He never said anything publicly. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=885.2s)]
*  I know there's been a lot of buzz privately, but he never said one thing. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=887.6s)]
*  So I mean, what's really scary for this. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=890.6s)]
*  If you're a Bucks fan is maybe they didn't do this to appease Yanis. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=894.0s)]
*  Maybe they just thought this was a good idea. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=898.44s)]
*  They just want to live on the edge. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=900.64s)]
*  That's where I would be really scared. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=902.16s)]
*  All right. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=904.52s)]
*  So the Houston piece, that was the second thing I was looking at them overstocking [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=904.72s)]
*  their roster and all the flexibility they have. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=909.76s)]
*  I mean, here's their roster right now. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=912.9200000000001s)]
*  They have Shen Goon, Adams and Capella and Jack Landau, who's apparently [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=914.28s)]
*  just not going to play anymore. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=918.08s)]
*  They have Durant, Jabari Smith and Phinney Smith. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=920.0s)]
*  They have a men Thompson, Eason Whitmore, Fred Van Vliet and Reed Shepard. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=923.44s)]
*  And there's only 240 minutes in a basketball game. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=928.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=931.8s)]
*  So that, that my interpretation is they're stacking this for a three for one in the [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=932.4s)]
*  December, January, February range that they, they basically have depth at every [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=939.9599999999999s)]
*  position now. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=944.04s)]
*  And if somebody comes to them and says, we'll do this for Shen Goon, I wouldn't [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=945.3599999999999s)]
*  trade Thompson, but Shen Goon and Thompson for this or Shen Goon, Jabari [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=950.3199999999999s)]
*  Smith and Eason, plus some of your picks for this, they're not positioned for that. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=954.5999999999999s)]
*  And then also they're one of the five contenders in the NBA now, one of the [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=960.08s)]
*  five best odds. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=964.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=965.2s)]
*  So no brainer, but I was just, the Capella thing really surprised me. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=965.72s)]
*  What was your take on the Rockets? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=969.32s)]
*  I think there's two things. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=970.8000000000001s)]
*  One, you're right. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=971.9200000000001s)]
*  Like opening themselves up for future trades. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=972.6800000000001s)]
*  If they come up, like the Rockets have been a team that have had too many guys [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=974.9200000000001s)]
*  for years already. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=978.36s)]
*  And so to add even more bodies to that mix is, is surprising, but it's a [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=979.4s)]
*  powerful thing if you're going to make those sorts of mid season trades, like [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=983.76s)]
*  you saw what just happened to the Lakers, for example, when they made a huge team [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=986.44s)]
*  changing trade in the middle of the run. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=990.36s)]
*  And all of a sudden you just like don't have a complete rotation. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=992.6800000000001s)]
*  I think basically any permutation of a deal that the Rockets would make, they [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=995.84s)]
*  would still have some quality center. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=999.8800000000001s)]
*  They would still have enough wings. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1001.84s)]
*  They would still have enough guard play to make all those things work mid stream, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1003.12s)]
*  which clearly they're trying to push forward and contend right now. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1006.48s)]
*  The other part of it, I would say is Kevin Durant is the piece that makes them so [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1009.48s)]
*  much more formidable in the playoffs. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1013.96s)]
*  Like an absolute half court killer, one of the best shot creators in the game [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1015.36s)]
*  under that context, really important player. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1018.6800000000001s)]
*  Clint Capella and Dorian Finney-Smith, I think will help. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1021.6s)]
*  And especially Dorian in the playoffs, like I'm sure will be part of the rotation [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1024.96s)]
*  in a meaningful way if he's still on the team by then. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1027.68s)]
*  They help you get through the regular season in a way that's really important. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1030.48s)]
*  Like you can't, you don't want to play Steven Adams, even necessarily full time [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1033.16s)]
*  backup minutes over the course of the regular season. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1038.1200000000001s)]
*  Like you want to save him a little bit so that he can have the kind of impact he [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1040.4s)]
*  had in last year's playoffs. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1043.6s)]
*  Tara Eason gets hurt a ton. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1045.0800000000002s)]
*  Kevin Durant has a ton of mileage on him and a guy like Dorian Finney-Smith helps [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1046.96s)]
*  you alleviate the burden on those guys in terms of the minutes that they're [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1050.48s)]
*  ultimately going to be playing. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1053.52s)]
*  And so it is a really deep rotation. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1054.72s)]
*  You got to find some way to keep everybody happy while, you know, giving [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1056.68s)]
*  Reed Shepard some developmental opportunities while letting Ahmen Thompson [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1060.2s)]
*  be everything he can be while letting Jabari play the three and the four and [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1063.5600000000002s)]
*  the five, apparently like you want to do all that stuff and it's going to be hard [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1067.28s)]
*  for Imodoka to balance all of it at once. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1070.24s)]
*  But what a great problem to have. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1072.64s)]
*  Well, especially this is basically the OKC model of like just a ton of depth, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1074.8400000000001s)]
*  giving guys a day off and. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1079.52s)]
*  But you saw how it worked for Alex Caruso, you know, like, like that's kind of [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1083.72s)]
*  the model that they need to take with some of these, like Tara Eason needs to [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1086.64s)]
*  be on the Alex Caruso plan. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1089.76s)]
*  I think that's, that's ultimately the goal for someone like him. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1091.4s)]
*  It's a really good team. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1095.0s)]
*  Um, I'm still not, there's a Jabari-Smith stretch five piece that it's funny they [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1097.28s)]
*  have all these centers because the lineup I was probably the most excited about [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1103.48s)]
*  was KD, Wichibari-Smith and Eason and Thompson and a guard where they're just a [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1106.76s)]
*  little more like Indiana-ish. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1112.6s)]
*  Um, but they also have this ability to go big ball too. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1114.8s)]
*  Um, listen, we, I'm going to make fun of a bunch of GMs and teams over the [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1118.32s)]
*  course of this podcast. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1124.6s)]
*  You got to hand it to Houston, man. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1125.68s)]
*  I still didn't love the hardened trade. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1127.88s)]
*  I didn't, I thought it was weird that they didn't get enough assets back, but [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1129.56s)]
*  it all worked out and, uh, everything they did the last three years, I just [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1133.0s)]
*  fully support, but the Finney-Smith piece that leads to the third thing. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1137.08s)]
*  Um, the Lakers losing Finney-Smith and then all the LeBron stuff. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1141.08s)]
*  It just feels like the big takeaway is we head into July 4th weekend is the Lakers [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1148.08s)]
*  are going to be a capital F fucking soap opera. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1152.64s)]
*  This feels like just content constantly. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1156.16s)]
*  And the Finney-Smith thing, which I think are with the people that know this shit, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1160.32s)]
*  I, it didn't feel like it was a big enough story publicly that the Lakers screwed up [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1165.24s)]
*  the Finney-Smith thing that he, that him and his agent felt like Polanco was kind [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1169.16s)]
*  of negging his value in the open market and telling teams he was hurt. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1173.92s)]
*  And they found out about it and they pulled back and were like, that's it. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1177.64s)]
*  We're not. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1182.08s)]
*  And then they, they went and solicited the Houston thing. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1182.48s)]
*  I think the Lakers thought he was coming back and that they were going to get a [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1186.2s)]
*  center and that was going to be their summer plan. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1189.6s)]
*  Instead they lose him. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1192.0s)]
*  They have to pivot to Laravio who they probably could have gotten anyway. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1193.3999999999999s)]
*  Um, all month, all June, we're like all every Laker fan and well, we're going to [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1196.6399999999999s)]
*  get a center when we get a center, when we get a center and I would, I would always [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1201.84s)]
*  be like, well, who's the center. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1204.6s)]
*  And now we're sitting here. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1207.76s)]
*  It's 9 26 AM. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1209.32s)]
*  And the only center left is the Andre Aitin who Portland paid to go away. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1212.04s)]
*  And they lose Phinney Smith, this guy who I thought was important for them because [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1216.48s)]
*  they, you know, he plays well with Luca and he's exactly the kind of guy you need [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1220.48s)]
*  if you're going to have Luca and LeBron together. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1223.8799999999999s)]
*  So just let's start there. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1226.6s)]
*  This is a disaster for them because they're just not, they are not even close [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1228.52s)]
*  to the top four in the West now. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1232.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't think they feel really far removed from it. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1235.08s)]
*  Like they needed to have a great summer in exactly the way you described, like [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1237.6399999999999s)]
*  bring in a center who can actually play. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1241.52s)]
*  Not only bring back Dorian Phinney Smith, but be like adding net players to your [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1244.0s)]
*  rotation. This was a team that was just like starved for guys who could actually [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1248.0s)]
*  stay on the floor in terms of playoff, viable rotation players. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1251.1200000000001s)]
*  So to lose Dorian Phinney Smith, look, he's an imperfect player. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1254.6s)]
*  He's not the best defender in the league, but he's a good, a very good one. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1257.96s)]
*  He's not the best shooting wing in the league. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1261.8s)]
*  He can be a little streaky, but he's certainly good enough for a team like the [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1263.92s)]
*  Lakers in their position. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1266.56s)]
*  A summer in which you get one of these free agent center options, plus bring back [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1268.16s)]
*  Dorian, plus get Jay Clarivi, who actually quite like as a rotation guy. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1272.28s)]
*  Me too. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1276.2s)]
*  That's a pretty good start to whiff on two of those things already in a way that, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1276.84s)]
*  I mean, you're not just like banking on Deandre Ayton. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1282.08s)]
*  You are praying for Deandre Ayton. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1284.6s)]
*  Because left, there's not one center left. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1287.04s)]
*  Horford's going to Golden State. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1289.52s)]
*  I mean, that's basically treated as a foregone conclusion around the league [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1291.24s)]
*  right now. Everyone is assuming that Horford will be a Golden State warrior. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1294.56s)]
*  And we'll see if that ends up happening or not, but it's happening. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1297.92s)]
*  Outside of that, I really don't know where they turn. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1301.0800000000002s)]
*  They've already missed out on Lopez, who we talked about. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1303.3600000000001s)]
*  They have missed out on Luke Cornett. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1305.28s)]
*  They missed out on Bobby Portis. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1307.0s)]
*  They missed out on Kavan Looney, Jalen Williams. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1308.3600000000001s)]
*  Like all these guys are already off the board. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1310.24s)]
*  They missed out on Luke Garza. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1312.04s)]
*  They missed out on Luca Garza. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1314.0s)]
*  They missed out on Josh Menott. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1315.24s)]
*  They could only be so lucky, frankly, at this point. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1316.8400000000001s)]
*  But the LeBron thing is such a huge wrench. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1319.44s)]
*  And I think what makes it especially painful is that what LeBron has articulated [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1322.5600000000002s)]
*  vis-a-vis Rich Paul about this being a cute little rebuilding team at present [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1327.44s)]
*  is not entirely wrong. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1331.96s)]
*  Like this is not a team that is close to the level of competition [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1333.52s)]
*  that would threaten the Thunder. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1337.48s)]
*  Like they're just not even close to it. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1338.6000000000001s)]
*  Rossella and I talked about it Sunday. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1340.48s)]
*  And I was pretty focused on it because I felt like it was going to be a big. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1342.1200000000001s)]
*  I thought the LeBron, the Rich Paul statement, I was like, this is what's happening here. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1345.28s)]
*  This feels aggressive. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1349.32s)]
*  And I think part of it was they already knew Phinney Smith was leaving, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1351.1200000000001s)]
*  which leads to that statement. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1356.12s)]
*  We're like, wait, we we're losing him? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1357.52s)]
*  What the hell's going on? [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1360.6399999999999s)]
*  Um, this is part of the soap opera piece. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1362.1599999999999s)]
*  LeBron with no leverage for the first time in his career, playing for somebody [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1366.1999999999998s)]
*  else's team where they've clearly said we're in the Luca business. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1371.6399999999999s)]
*  They had that thing come out yesterday about we don't want contracts longer [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1374.9599999999998s)]
*  than the next two years. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1378.0s)]
*  We've never seen, we've never seen a star as famous and as successful [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1380.6399999999999s)]
*  as LeBron in a situation like this. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1385.04s)]
*  It never happened to Kareem. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1388.0s)]
*  It never happened to a Bill Russell. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1390.04s)]
*  It never happened to Michael Jordan. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1392.84s)]
*  Uh, it never happened to Larry Bird. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1395.1599999999999s)]
*  It never happened to magic Johnson. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1397.08s)]
*  And those are the best players and it never happened to Tim Duncan. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1399.36s)]
*  These are all the best parts in the history of the league. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1402.1599999999999s)]
*  None of them have ever been in a situation where they're on somebody [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1404.1599999999999s)]
*  else's team on somebody else's timeline. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1407.0s)]
*  And the team is like, we don't really care what you think about any of this. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1410.12s)]
*  And that's why he's obviously going to get traded at some point. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1413.8s)]
*  And I just think, I think you can lock that one down. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1416.56s)]
*  He doesn't want to be, it doesn't seem like he wants to be in the Lakers. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1420.0s)]
*  And I think he wants to win titles, which was what I said Sunday night. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1422.52s)]
*  I cannot figure out the team. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1425.6s)]
*  Um, I thought was was on Zach's pod yesterday and kind of whipped out of a [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1427.6s)]
*  towns for LeBron trade and I was kind of like, Oh, that's really interesting. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1433.96s)]
*  Who says, who has a longer meeting about that? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1440.68s)]
*  Cause if you're the Knicks, you get off all the towns money. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1444.24s)]
*  You do. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1446.92s)]
*  And if you're the Lakers, you get to reboot, you get out of LeBron. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1447.72s)]
*  Who's good. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1453.1200000000001s)]
*  I just think going to be more and more grumbly as the year goes along. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1453.92s)]
*  Cause he's never been in this situation. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1457.72s)]
*  You bring in towns. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1459.6s)]
*  It doesn't fit your contract time table, but at least he's a center. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1460.52s)]
*  And you have two amazing shooters. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1464.4s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1466.16s)]
*  I don't know who would say no faster. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1467.1200000000001s)]
*  Who would say no faster? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1470.8s)]
*  I think the Knicks might not because like, look, the, the virtues of adding LeBron [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1472.8400000000001s)]
*  to a team in New York's position are not lost on me. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1478.76s)]
*  There's just such an opportunity in the East right now. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1481.56s)]
*  And if, if you're, I think if you're the Knicks and the Cavs in particular, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1484.4s)]
*  it just behooves you to not do something super dramatic right now. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1487.92s)]
*  Like keep the teams that you know, work add on the edges as the Knicks have done. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1491.6000000000001s)]
*  Like Gershon Yabusele, Jordan Clarkson, like those are, that's a good off season [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1495.8s)]
*  for New York already in terms of shoring up some of their weaknesses. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1499.0s)]
*  You know, the rest of the stuff works. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1502.44s)]
*  Carl, Carl Anthony Towns just had an all in BA season. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1504.0s)]
*  I think he meets, did he make second team? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1506.3600000000001s)]
*  Like he was an incredible player for them. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1507.8400000000001s)]
*  I think losing him would hurt their offense in ways that they might just kind [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1511.3600000000001s)]
*  of casually overlook as we're kind of talking through the LeBron possibilities. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1516.04s)]
*  And look, anytime LeBron's on the board, you have to take the meeting. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1519.28s)]
*  You have to talk about it. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1522.1200000000001s)]
*  You have to figure out what are the permutations of this that can work. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1523.08s)]
*  I just, I think Kat is really valuable to the Knicks and his present tense value [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1527.04s)]
*  as a team that could win the East next season is more important to me than [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1531.56s)]
*  ultimately what his contract is going to drag down in a couple of seasons. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1535.48s)]
*  So you don't think Knicks GM coach Rick Brunson would sign up on this also? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1538.96s)]
*  Cause it would maybe affect his son. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1543.8s)]
*  There you go. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1545.8s)]
*  Seems like a problem when the Brunson's are running the Knicks. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1546.56s)]
*  We're like, why do they want LeBron in there? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1549.68s)]
*  Trying to, trying to think he knows stuff. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1551.32s)]
*  I would think about it from a salary cap standpoint too, because you got to pay [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1553.92s)]
*  bridges in a year and you're going to have just a super expensive roster. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1558.24s)]
*  And the LeBron piece would allow you to kind of change the money a little [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1562.76s)]
*  bit where LeBron's got, I mean, people are claiming he's got a year left. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1566.48s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1570.76s)]
*  I think it's, I think this goes more like Tom Brady where it just kind of keeps [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1571.52s)]
*  going and going and going, but I I'm just, he's not going to win a title in the [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1575.92s)]
*  Lakers. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1579.8s)]
*  I said this Sunday night, it's not happening. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1580.1200000000001s)]
*  What's important to him? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1583.48s)]
*  Well, the other important thing would be I have my own team that I'm running. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1584.68s)]
*  He doesn't have that either. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1588.92s)]
*  So there's, there has to be some sort of outcome. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1590.24s)]
*  That's not the outcome he's in now. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1592.3600000000001s)]
*  Um, I was thinking it's a little, it's a little like to be more in the substance, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1594.88s)]

*  Can I throw another trade at you that I was thinking about? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1608.72s)]

*  Um, if you're the Lakers, you get out of this weird LeBron situation. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1624.48s)]
*  I don't know if it changes your destiny that much, but at least it [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1629.24s)]

*  I, I kind of like it. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1639.64s)]
*  Oh, I, I, I, ultimately, I think there's probably. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1641.68s)]
*  Too much like extracurricular shit on an LA to LA trade for both teams to actually do it. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1644.64s)]
*  Like the whole, like, you just have to live in this city and deal with the fact [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1650.0800000000002s)]
*  that if this trade goes sideways, it went sideways on a daily basis might be reason [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1653.5600000000002s)]
*  enough to not do it, but as LeBron destinations go, I think the Clippers [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1658.0s)]
*  make more sense than the Mavericks, for example, who like that stuff is just [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1661.5600000000002s)]
*  kind of out there right now, as far as like, oh, Dallas could be an option. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1664.4s)]
*  I don't really see mechanically how that would work. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1667.92s)]
*  I don't really see the argument for it. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1669.92s)]
*  But look, this is kind of how you have to think about LeBron at this point. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1671.6000000000001s)]
*  Like he is one of the best players in the world. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1675.0400000000002s)]

*  It's going to be someone with a contract like Downs or a player of a clearly [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1691.4s)]

*  with all the questions that come with him. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1698.96s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1702.8s)]

*  And I don't know why the Knicks would do that. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1707.0800000000002s)]
*  I don't know why the Knicks would do it, but from the Lakers perspective, you [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1708.72s)]

*  We found out Jaylen Williams was hurt during the whole second half of the [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1897.92s)]

*  Oh, definitely. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1909.36s)]
*  And especially the idea of Michael Porter Jr. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1910.0s)]
*  Is a uniquely talented shooter and really one of the best shooters in terms of a [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1912.36s)]

*  Porter Jr. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1935.76s)]

*  going to get. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1939.76s)]

*  case, like our material, like this is the difference in the nuggets, having [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1943.92s)]
*  actual flexibility versus not. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1947.92s)]
*  This is not just like, how much money are we saving the cronkeys? [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1949.6000000000001s)]
*  Like this is a big deal in terms of the team building of the nuggets. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1952.52s)]
*  And they're in a position where they could still potentially add pieces. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1955.24s)]
*  They're probably incentivized not to because of the tax, but they could. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1958.12s)]
*  And ultimately the idea that you're taking last year's roster and getting it [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1962.4s)]
*  to a place where you have what? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1965.56s)]
*  Like I would say six rock solid playoff guys. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1966.76s)]
*  And after that, a good collection of, okay, in this series, Jonas Valanchunis [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1970.96s)]
*  is going to be a real player for us in this series. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1975.56s)]
*  Seven. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1977.68s)]
*  Who do you consider? [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1978.6399999999999s)]
*  Oh, I guess Peyton Watson, I guess is a pretty solid seven. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1979.68s)]
*  They got Hardaway jr. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1982.4s)]
*  I feel like I could throw him out, but I could throw him out in the second [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1983.44s)]
*  quarter of a playoff game and not worry what they had in the playoffs last year. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1987.0800000000002s)]
*  These young guys where you feel like the three is going to hit the side of the [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1991.0s)]
*  backboard, at least he's not going to be scared. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1993.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he will not be. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1996.72s)]
*  I can promise you. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1997.76s)]
*  He will not be scared. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1998.72s)]
*  He definitely will not be scared. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=1999.5600000000002s)]
*  This is the Tim Hardaway jr. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2000.52s)]
*  thing, and this is why this is such a great fit for him. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2001.72s)]
*  The less you have to rely on him, the better Tim Hardaway jr. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2004.24s)]
*  is. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2007.48s)]
*  Be a heat check guy for us. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2007.68s)]
*  Be a heat check guy. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2008.6000000000001s)]
*  I love about what they did is that now they can bring, like they can take Aaron [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2009.72s)]
*  Gordon out of the game and put Bruce Brown in to do like a, basically a short [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2015.08s)]
*  Aaron Gordon impression for like five, six minutes, right? [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2020.28s)]
*  That's what he's playing off the ball. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2022.8799999999999s)]
*  He's running the baseline. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2024.36s)]
*  He's doing all that stuff. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2025.24s)]
*  They can, uh, they can have the cam Johnson basically in the Michael Porter [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2026.3999999999999s)]
*  jr. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2030.96s)]
*  role, but then they also have those young guys, maybe a year older. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2031.28s)]
*  I know that could be okay. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2036.32s)]
*  And then they actually have a backup center. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2038.36s)]
*  That's not the Andrew Jordan who might be able to come in and punish a backup [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2040.08s)]
*  center or backup big guy for five minutes and make some points happen. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2044.3999999999999s)]
*  And I still feel like they got one move left. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2048.6s)]
*  Like Sarge wasn't playing for them. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2050.24s)]
*  No, you know, they got a rotation guy for Dario Sarge and I, I don't even [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2051.92s)]
*  know what the Kings are up to at this point in the game, but frankly, a miracle [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2056.3599999999997s)]
*  given where Sarge's trade value was. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2060.12s)]
*  And this is, there are a lot of miracles in this off season. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2062.16s)]
*  A lot of them had to do with really stupid teams. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2064.96s)]
*  And somebody like Sacramento going, man, we just need more money to pay Dennis [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2068.12s)]
*  Schroeder so we can be the 12th best team in the West. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2073.52s)]
*  Uh, let's take Sarge's contract and we can dump Valencianists and now [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2076.88s)]
*  we'll have enough money. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2081.24s)]
*  It's like, good, great job guys. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2082.0s)]
*  Uh, I just think for Denver, um, if I was a Denver fan, we talked about a bunch [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2084.3199999999997s)]
*  on this pod, I would have been so upset with, I just feel like they cheaped out [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2089.72s)]
*  last year on him. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2093.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2094.7999999999997s)]
*  You have a guy like that who's a generational superstar. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2095.76s)]
*  You can't cheap out. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2098.76s)]
*  And they did. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2099.88s)]
*  And it comes down to a seventh game in OKC that they got waxed in, but really [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2100.76s)]
*  the first six games, a couple that they could have swung, I think if they had one [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2105.52s)]
*  more guy or one more guy you could rely on. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2109.52s)]
*  Um, so now- [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2112.4s)]
*  Brown could be the difference between an OKC style matchup, you know, and he's [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2113.96s)]
*  had a rough couple of seasons, but just having like a live body and the way you [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2118.28s)]
*  described to is doing some of the Aaron Gordon stuff and some of the backup point [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2121.48s)]
*  guard stuff and some of the Christian Brown on ball defense. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2125.6s)]
*  Like, that's a miracle of a player to get for the minimum. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2128.16s)]
*  And somebody that you know, fits in with your team perfectly. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2131.84s)]
*  Without a doubt. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2135.84s)]
*  So the last thing they probably need is some sort of Jamal Murray. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2137.12s)]
*  Um, if he's out for two weeks, you know, if you want to rest his minutes, if you [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2140.92s)]
*  want to rest them for a game, they don't really have that guy yet. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2145.7200000000003s)]
*  Um, those guys are available. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2149.12s)]
*  Anyway, congrats to Denver. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2151.2000000000003s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2152.48s)]
*  Next one. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2154.32s)]
*  Next topic. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2155.0s)]
*  It's officially the Trey Young superstar audition season. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2157.52s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2161.2000000000003s)]
*  Because Atlanta had an awesome off season. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2161.96s)]
*  Just awesome. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2163.8s)]
*  Um, I think they're an actual contender in the East. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2165.08s)]
*  There's no question. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2167.64s)]
*  They have a starting lineup of Trey, Jalen Johnson, Dyson Daniels, Alexander [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2169.7200000000003s)]
*  Walker and a Kang Wu with Risa Shea, poor Zingas Newell, and still room for one more [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2173.88s)]
*  guy off the bench and they have picks to trade. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2179.8s)]
*  Well, they did get Luke Kennard too. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2182.1200000000003s)]
*  Oh, and Luke Kennard. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2183.76s)]
*  I forgot to write him down. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2184.6400000000003s)]
*  Luke Kennard. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2186.92s)]
*  Wow. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2188.6800000000003s)]
*  I really liked this team. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2189.32s)]
*  Luke Kennard was my dream Denver guy. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2190.4s)]
*  Um, and still the trade exception for one more guy if they wanted to get frisky. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2192.96s)]
*  And yet all of it hinges on whether Trey Young is actually a superstar or not. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2198.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2203.6400000000003s)]
*  We're going to find out once the problem he's got last year of his deal. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2204.32s)]
*  And we're going to see. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2207.5600000000004s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2208.64s)]
*  Let's see what this looks like. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2209.08s)]
*  We have given you the perfect car. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2210.12s)]
*  You are Brad Pitt and F1 on IMAX right now. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2212.3999999999996s)]
*  That was a junker of a car. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2216.0s)]
*  They really had to fix it up. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2217.16s)]
*  Maybe this is his fix up season. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2218.16s)]
*  Oh, did you see? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2219.92s)]
*  I just still haven't, I'm seeing F1 probably today. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2220.44s)]
*  It was good. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2223.3599999999997s)]
*  You liked it? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2223.7999999999997s)]
*  Worth the ticket. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2224.48s)]
*  Got to see it on IMAX. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2225.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2226.24s)]
*  Um, we're going to find out now with Trey Young is my point. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2226.96s)]
*  Any thoughts? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2230.72s)]
*  I think he has shown a lot of the precursors of that last season in [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2232.56s)]
*  terms of his willingness to commit to defense a little bit more in terms of [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2237.32s)]
*  the way he was playing on offense. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2240.8s)]
*  Like he was doing all the stuff you want to see from Trey Young. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2242.1200000000003s)]
*  It just didn't result in the overall kind of team season that we may want [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2245.76s)]
*  from the Atlanta Hawks and now they have all the more reason and all the more [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2248.6000000000004s)]
*  insurance in terms of just the depth of this roster to get through the year. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2251.52s)]
*  And I think even more of an identity that makes sense for them. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2255.8s)]
*  And it makes sense for Quinn Snyder, frankly, like they ended up in that zone [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2258.48s)]
*  where they were neither an elite offense nor an elite defense. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2261.44s)]
*  Well, the Jalen Johnson injury kind of set that, I mean, they lost them for four [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2265.04s)]
*  months, completely took the wind out of their sails and if Jalen Johnson can [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2268.52s)]
*  stay healthy and that's, that's an if in its own right. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2272.16s)]
*  And if Chris, that's where Zingas can stay healthy and that's an if in its own [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2274.64s)]
*  right. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2277.28s)]
*  And if on Yucca, a Kong Wu can stay healthy, also an if, uh, they're going to [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2277.56s)]
*  be really well positioned, like they're going to look like a really dynamic team. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2282.48s)]
*  And in terms of good Lord, like Nikhil Alexander Walker and Dyson Daniels [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2285.44s)]
*  together is it's not quite Oklahoma city's perimeter defense, but it's the [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2289.84s)]
*  closest you're going to find in the East. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2293.76s)]
*  It's well, then you to put Johnson and Daniels and Alexander Walker together. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2296.1200000000003s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2302.48s)]
*  That's just not a fun night for opposing perimeter guys. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2302.92s)]
*  It's like, ah, fuck I'm playing the Hawks tonight. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2306.76s)]
*  Let's hunt Trey Young. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2309.0s)]
*  Oh shit. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2310.0s)]
*  Trey's not in the game. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2310.44s)]
*  Now what do we do? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2312.4s)]
*  And I like that they have poor Zingas kind of as the wild card, who the fuck [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2313.2000000000003s)]
*  knows guy, you know, because if he can be closer to first year Celtics versus [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2317.6000000000004s)]
*  second year Celtics, that's like, now you're putting him out there with Trey. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2323.48s)]
*  Like you have all these different wrinkles now. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2330.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2332.08s)]
*  I really like this Hawks team. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2332.48s)]
*  We're not a smart Hawks team. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2334.52s)]
*  I know. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2336.72s)]
*  Look, it's, it's a whole new era, but like, really is. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2337.2400000000002s)]
*  I think the thing with poor Zingas, in addition to just being that sort of [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2339.84s)]
*  wild card, he doesn't really cost them anything. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2342.28s)]
*  Like if you're the Celtics, he is immeasurably, well, he is measurably [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2344.84s)]
*  expensive, incredibly expensive to the point that they're still over the [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2348.76s)]
*  second apron somehow. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2351.76s)]
*  They dumped all the salary. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2352.64s)]
*  They're still a second apron team. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2353.68s)]
*  The whole situation is kind of ridiculous. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2355.04s)]
*  Fear the Hawks. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2357.08s)]
*  This is a short-term bet on a very talented player in a, in a somewhat more [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2357.92s)]
*  contained role that I think could make sense for him. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2361.8399999999997s)]
*  And it's an expiring worst case scenario. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2364.2799999999997s)]
*  It's a $30 million expiring that with your picks, you might be able to go, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2367.72s)]
*  let's say he breaks down or gets hurt, whatever you can still potentially flip that. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2372.0s)]
*  I thought that trade, I don't know what Brooklyn was doing with that trade, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2376.44s)]
*  especially when you saw some of the prices of some of these guys like [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2380.24s)]
*  Finney Smith or Duncan Robinson, like Terrence Mann at 15 million. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2383.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2387.56s)]
*  To also get the 22nd pick to take that and use your cap space. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2389.48s)]
*  I just don't personally understand it. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2394.52s)]
*  I just think there's better, like the Celtics I think would have traded Sam [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2397.2s)]
*  Hauser to whoever and Sam Hauser is like four years, 38 million, something like [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2400.9199999999996s)]
*  that. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2405.56s)]
*  That it's a really good contract for a rotation guy. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2405.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't understand why I'm paying Terrence Mann 15 million a year and why [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2408.2799999999997s)]
*  that would be a good thing. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2411.08s)]
*  It's not a horrendous deal. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2412.36s)]
*  And like Terrence Mann is a good player. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2413.8s)]
*  So it's not like they're taking pure dead money as is often the case. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2415.12s)]
*  I'm just saying compared to all these signings we're watching. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2418.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2421.2s)]
*  I just don't understand it. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2422.16s)]
*  Here's my perspective on it. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2423.7599999999998s)]
*  If you were, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2425.68s)]
*  Compela is going to make 7 million a year. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2426.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2428.24s)]
*  Terrence Mann is going to make 15. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2428.4s)]
*  If you are going to be the basically one team with cap space, do not use it this [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2430.48s)]
*  early for that purpose. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2436.16s)]
*  Like we've just talked about all the ways that the Bucs are desperate. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2438.08s)]
*  They're not the only team. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2442.08s)]
*  Like the Lakers are in that space too. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2443.08s)]
*  Like there's so many teams who are trying to get stuff done right now. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2445.08s)]
*  And if you can just wait and not jump at Terrence Mann in a pick, then I think [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2448.24s)]
*  Brooklyn had an opportunity to play out this market a little bit more. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2452.88s)]
*  But also they have four fucking picks already. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2455.44s)]
*  What do they need a fifth pick for? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2458.12s)]
*  You're at four. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2459.52s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2461.08s)]
*  Just wait. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2461.72s)]
*  You're the only team with cap space. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2462.72s)]
*  We're going to talk about them later. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2464.2799999999997s)]
*  I have a lot of thoughts on them. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2465.64s)]
*  That's kind of the other part of the LeBron conversation too, is that the Lakers [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2466.92s)]
*  in many ways, although their situation is messy and complicated and they're going [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2470.36s)]
*  to have to find their way out of it. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2473.6800000000003s)]
*  They are so incredibly lucky that LeBron's situation is coinciding with a [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2475.32s)]
*  market with zero cap space. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2479.7200000000003s)]
*  Like there's no free agent team where LeBron would have turned down his option [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2481.28s)]
*  and then gone there. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2484.76s)]
*  And that's the only reason we can even talk about like, can they get OG and [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2485.7200000000003s)]
*  Anobe? [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2488.48s)]
*  Like they should be so lucky again, as to get a player like that. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2488.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2492.44s)]
*  Well, Atlanta is in the mix. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2493.88s)]
*  I think Atlanta right now on FanDuel, they are 30 to one now. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2495.4s)]
*  So when we did the draft podcast a week ago, they were 33 to one to win the [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2503.84s)]
*  East and they're 30 to one to win the title. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2509.48s)]
*  And I think there's, you have New Orleans, I'm sorry, New York, Orlando, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2512.44s)]
*  and Cleveland definitely ahead of them. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2520.1600000000003s)]
*  I think there are probably four in the East right now. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2521.68s)]
*  I have them over Detroit, Philly, Milwaukee, Miami, and obviously Indiana [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2525.0s)]
*  and Boston, which brings us to the next thing. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2530.7599999999998s)]
*  Um, it's official. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2533.68s)]
*  It seems like Indiana and Boston are doing gap years. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2534.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2537.52s)]
*  I didn't know with Indiana, obviously know Hal Burton for the rest of the [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2540.2s)]
*  year, but they're deep and it seemed like Turner was coming back. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2544.0s)]
*  They pivoted. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2547.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't blame the pivot. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2548.64s)]
*  I think I see it both ways, but I would rather have the flexibility and the fact [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2550.72s)]
*  that they, this really sneaky situation of them getting their first round [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2555.7599999999998s)]
*  pick back before Halliburton got hurt. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2559.7999999999997s)]
*  One of the weirdest stroke of the Halliburton thing, the worst luck [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2562.04s)]
*  possible, getting the pick back a week before, like kind of weirdly lucky. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2565.16s)]
*  So now if they want, they can just throw away the season and, and [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2570.44s)]
*  getting rid of miles Turner. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2574.04s)]
*  I think was a sign. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2575.32s)]
*  Um, they don't have a center now. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2576.76s)]
*  They, I guess Nemard is going to be the point guard, but they, they [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2579.0s)]
*  might not be a playoff team. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2582.1600000000003s)]
*  What would you do if you're Indiana? [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2583.5600000000004s)]
*  I, here's the, I think it depends on the thinking behind miles Turner. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2586.2000000000003s)]
*  If the reason you don't bring back miles Turner is because you value [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2590.0s)]
*  some of the flexibility and honestly, there are good basketball reasons, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2592.92s)]
*  even for a team that just went to the finals to want to reconsider its [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2596.92s)]
*  center space, but they're not going to be able to do that. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2600.52s)]
*  To want to reconsider its center spot in general, like miles Turner, a [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2603.08s)]
*  good shooter, like showed himself to be flexible enough, like rolling into [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2607.88s)]
*  kind of mid range shots, like sealing smalls inside some good defensive [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2611.2000000000003s)]
*  stretches, definitely some good defensive stretches. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2614.96s)]
*  And I would say, especially in the finals, that was kind of [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2616.96s)]
*  his better end of the floor. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2618.6000000000004s)]
*  Um, but at the same time, like you might want someone who like [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2620.48s)]
*  connects more on screens and frees up Halliburton to drive. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2623.52s)]
*  You may want someone who's even more of a presence going downhill. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2626.2400000000002s)]
*  Like I think it's fair for the Pacers with everything they have. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2629.56s)]
*  And one of the best pastors in the world coming back after his injury to [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2632.7599999999998s)]
*  think about like, how do we, what do we want the future of our team to look like? [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2636.12s)]
*  I think you could probably resign miles Turner and still have all those [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2639.44s)]
*  conversations and debates and entertain the trademark it down the line. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2642.44s)]
*  What I worry about is that this is a team that has never paid the luxury [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2646.36s)]
*  tax and miles Turner is basically this contract that would have put them over [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2651.16s)]
*  the tax. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2655.2s)]
*  And so if like, or sorry, I actually, they have, it's just been 20 years. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2655.64s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2659.16s)]
*  Since the patients that paid the luxury tax. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2659.48s)]
*  Um, if that's the reason after you just went to the finals, miss me with that. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2661.68s)]
*  Like, I'm just not compelled by that as a reason to not bring back miles Turner. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2666.3199999999997s)]
*  It just seems like it was a little rich for their blood, whether it was the tax [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2670.56s)]
*  or whatever else. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2674.0s)]
*  Um, okay. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2675.0s)]
*  So he left them alone at the top of the key of the whole series. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2676.12s)]
*  They just did. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2679.64s)]
*  He couldn't shoot and he couldn't make a shot. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2680.3999999999996s)]
*  And I told that story after one game four, when they had that, that 86 76 lead [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2682.12s)]
*  and probably the title in their hands that came, because I think if they win [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2688.04s)]
*  game four, they win the thing. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2690.88s)]
*  And he missed a couple and the guy behind me was like, God, miles, that's [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2692.04s)]
*  your shot. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2696.12s)]
*  Like he had this 25 footer, the top of the key that was his shot for his [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2697.48s)]
*  entire Halliburton run. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2701.0s)]
*  And he just, it stopped going in. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2703.24s)]
*  I think that when you think like, uh, it's probably only going to get worse for a [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2704.76s)]
*  big guy as they hit their thirties. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2709.44s)]
*  They seem like they got spooked. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2711.64s)]
*  And if you think, all right, this is our gap year, miles Turner helps them win [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2714.0800000000004s)]
*  games. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2719.0800000000004s)]
*  Maybe they did. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2719.6400000000003s)]
*  That makes me think they don't want to win games. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2720.36s)]
*  Maybe not. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2722.52s)]
*  That's where they've landed. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2722.92s)]
*  And it also allows them to bring math or him back, but, um, it's going to be a [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2724.2400000000002s)]
*  weird, weird team. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2728.36s)]
*  They have a lot of equity with their fans. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2729.36s)]
*  Um, there was a piece with this though, that him going to Milwaukee was really [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2732.5600000000004s)]
*  interesting because those things really dislike each other. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2736.84s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2739.6400000000003s)]
*  Um, that was like, it reminded me a little when Ray Allen, I mean, this was [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2740.3999999999996s)]
*  worse when Ray Allen went to Miami and the Celtics had just been through that [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2744.24s)]
*  2012 Eastern conference finals war with them. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2749.3599999999997s)]
*  That was really, really surly and competitive. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2752.6s)]
*  And then he jumped over there and it wasn't, I never blamed him because they [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2755.44s)]
*  had tried to trade him in February. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2758.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2760.56s)]
*  So it's like, all right, we can't play the loyalty card when they almost traded [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2760.92s)]
*  him four months ago, but as same thing was like, it was like, Whoa, you're [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2765.44s)]
*  going to Miami. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2769.48s)]
*  We hate those guys. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2770.44s)]
*  And I think the Pacers bucks is a little bit like that. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2772.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2774.88s)]
*  So that one surprised me. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2775.4s)]
*  Look, that's one area in which, look, the bucks being more competitive next [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2776.88s)]
*  season and we'll see how much the Pacers lean into the idea of like really [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2779.96s)]
*  pushing hard to win as many games as possible. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2783.52s)]
*  But every time those teams play, it's going to be fun. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2785.68s)]
*  Every time you see miles turn in a bucks Jersey, it's, I think it's going to [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2787.88s)]
*  add something a little to the game and they're going to get Isaiah Jackson back [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2790.68s)]
*  presumably too, like they put the qualifying offer in on him and he, you [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2795.0s)]
*  know, again, long-term recovery from the torn. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2798.24s)]
*  He also had a torn Achilles last season, uh, but was a good energy big for them. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2801.2799999999997s)]
*  And if he can be that again, you can start to see how a center rotation would [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2805.16s)]
*  come together, not one that's as good as the group that just went to the NBA [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2809.0s)]
*  finals, but that's the way it goes. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2812.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2814.16s)]
*  And maybe, I don't know if they've decided on Thomas Bryan yet, but I [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2814.3599999999997s)]
*  know he's still a free agent. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2818.8799999999997s)]
*  Um, maybe you just try to patch it together with him and Isaiah Jackson [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2820.9199999999996s)]
*  and do the math and like, could these guys give 70% of his stats and 40% of [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2825.4s)]
*  the defense and we were paying 5 million bucks instead of 25 rest [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2830.32s)]
*  of sure. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2834.52s)]
*  They already locked in Tony Bradley. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2834.8s)]
*  Tony Bradley is going nowhere. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2836.48s)]
*  He is an Indiana Pacer. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2838.36s)]
*  Pick up that option. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2840.36s)]
*  Good job, Tony Bradley. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2841.2400000000002s)]
*  It'd be funny if Indiana hated Milwaukee so much. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2842.6400000000003s)]
*  They're like, let's, let's let them have Turner and screw their cap [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2845.48s)]
*  with this game lower thing. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2849.52s)]
*  Let's, let's send these guys. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2850.7200000000003s)]
*  You know what? [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2852.56s)]
*  That would be the light year's move. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2853.76s)]
*  If you're the Indiana Pacers and you're like, you know what? [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2854.96s)]
*  All time spite move. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2856.96s)]
*  We're not content. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2858.28s)]
*  We're not contending until Tyrese comes back anyway. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2859.32s)]
*  Let's see where we are in two to three years. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2861.4s)]
*  Has any team demolished another team kind of quietly more than Indiana has [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2863.04s)]
*  demolished the bucks over the last couple of years, if they've still taken [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2867.2400000000002s)]
*  their heart and playoff series and now they've stuck them with the terrible cap [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2871.4s)]
*  situation. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2875.2s)]
*  I just want to say, I, I, we got to talk about the Boston piece too. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2876.2s)]
*  I just, the new CBA is just an apocalypse. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2879.68s)]
*  It's one of the worst things that I can remember in any pro sports league, how [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2883.76s)]
*  the, how it played out this way, where you have good teams basically sabotaging [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2887.8s)]
*  themselves because they're so afraid of these penalties that I don't know who [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2892.2000000000003s)]
*  wanted, I don't know who the penalties serve other than the owners as a check [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2896.92s)]
*  and a balance for them not to spend too much money. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2903.1600000000003s)]
*  That seems to be the only positive. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2906.0s)]
*  But when you have Boston basically just, you know, I was walking with my daughter [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2908.2400000000002s)]
*  the other day, I did, I actually put this on YouTube as a short because we, the [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2912.08s)]
*  Celtics have lost Cornett and I was talking to her about it and she was, you [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2916.64s)]
*  know, she's, this is the first team she's ever liked. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2921.68s)]
*  She goes to the games. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2923.88s)]
*  She just, she doesn't know any better. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2924.92s)]
*  She thinks these guys are just going to be in the team for 20 years. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2926.2799999999997s)]
*  They lose poor Zingas. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2929.52s)]
*  They lose drew holiday. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2931.3199999999997s)]
*  They lose Cornett. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2932.84s)]
*  I'm like, we're going to lose Al Horford to Golden state. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2933.68s)]
*  And she's like, I don't understand. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2935.6s)]
*  I really like these guys. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2937.6s)]
*  Why do they have to go? [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2938.92s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't know, blame the CBA. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2940.08s)]
*  I just don't think this is good for anybody to have, to have teams sabotaging [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2942.92s)]
*  themselves to save money. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2947.64s)]
*  That's a bad place to be in as a league. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2949.2799999999997s)]
*  For the solution to the super team free agent movement to be, make it basically [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2952.04s)]
*  impossible for contenders to sustain over time, it feels like a real [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2957.08s)]
*  misallocation of what actually just happened. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2961.16s)]
*  Like we're solving, we're trying to solve a problem by ultimately [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2963.12s)]
*  crippling the one actual solution. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2967.6s)]
*  Is like internal development teams, ability to retain their own players. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2970.16s)]
*  And the currency basically makes that model prohibitive to the point that, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2973.92s)]
*  yeah, teams like the Celtics are not just incentivized, but there is almost [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2977.56s)]
*  no logical explanation for why they would not take a gap year under these circumstances. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2981.7599999999998s)]
*  Like they need the relief. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2986.48s)]
*  It opens them up. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2988.24s)]
*  It's really the only way they can sort of rebuild their roster down the line. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2989.36s)]
*  And so this is what ends up happening. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2993.72s)]
*  It's like, yeah, you're just going to watch a lot of George and Yang. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2995.2s)]
*  Like it's just going to be what it is in this context. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=2997.68s)]
*  And I hate that that's the incentive structure. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3000.2799999999997s)]
*  I also think there's a lot of teams pretending to be afraid of the apron so [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3002.96s)]
*  that they can make normal cost cutting owner protecting moves to just like not [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3007.16s)]
*  spend as much money. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3011.52s)]
*  So it's like, it's a little of column A and column B, but column B definitely exists. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3012.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3017.6s)]
*  But then on the other hand, you have Devin Booker is now eligible to make [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3017.7999999999997s)]
*  $75 million a year. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3020.64s)]
*  It's like, what kind of league are we creating? [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3022.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3023.8399999999997s)]
*  Shade just signed for the biggest contract in the history of the league. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3024.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3028.8399999999997s)]
*  I just don't understand it. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3029.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3030.8799999999997s)]
*  Do you think any of this in terms of like making it impossible for teams to stay [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3031.12s)]
*  intact, does it suit our like short attention span, tick tock generation of [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3034.8399999999997s)]
*  consciousness? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3041.64s)]
*  Like if teams are going to just turn over every two years, does that kind of suit [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3042.3599999999997s)]
*  the way the world is right now? [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3046.48s)]
*  It's a good theory. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3050.64s)]
*  I'm not sure it's intentional, but we ended up there. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3052.28s)]
*  Well, but that's, I think that's the bigger question. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3054.6400000000003s)]
*  Who's driving this and who ultimately wanted it? [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3058.1200000000003s)]
*  Because my theory and what's been told to me over and over again, as these are the [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3060.96s)]
*  smaller market teams who are really scared of the warriors and the Knicks and [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3064.7200000000003s)]
*  the Lakers, just being able to blow them out of the water, paying crazy money and [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3069.04s)]
*  making them look inadequate. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3072.44s)]
*  Cause then I don't have the same deep pockets. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3073.6400000000003s)]
*  Right? [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3075.04s)]
*  So that leads to whatever we landed with the CBA. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3075.28s)]
*  But where we really landed was it's impossible to keep. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3078.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3082.32s)]
*  See probably as the best chance with those three guys and how they structured [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3082.6s)]
*  these little $8 million, we give extensions. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3087.84s)]
*  Our seventh guy is going to make $8 million a year. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3091.4s)]
*  Our ninth guy is going to make $5 million a year. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3093.6800000000003s)]
*  Six man is going to make that. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3095.8s)]
*  And they've just have figured out a way to maybe pull it off, but think about it. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3097.8s)]
*  They had to have one of the great watershed trades of all time just to be in that [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3101.88s)]
*  position where they get all these picks and that, and two of them turned out to be [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3106.3599999999997s)]
*  Jaylen Williams and, um, what was the other one? [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3111.08s)]
*  Oh, and Shay. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3115.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3115.7599999999998s)]
*  Shay comes in it. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3116.0s)]
*  That's, that's a generational fluke. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3118.2799999999997s)]
*  That's not happening again. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3120.64s)]
*  So you look at a team like Atlanta and Atlanta looks like they're in awesome shape [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3122.0s)]
*  right now and they did everything right. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3125.96s)]
*  They're really, really smart. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3127.6s)]
*  Well, what happens a year from now? [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3129.64s)]
*  They got to pay Trey Young. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3130.92s)]
*  Yep. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3132.56s)]
*  I think they have to pay Dyson Daniels. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3132.88s)]
*  They're going to have to pay Reese's Shay and they're not going to be able to keep [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3135.76s)]
*  all these guys together. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3138.84s)]
*  And if like, that's the goal of the CBA, that's fucking idiotic. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3139.84s)]
*  Um, Celtics gap year, there's no other way around it. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3143.88s)]
*  I'm surprised they didn't trade Sam Hauser. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3148.88s)]
*  I thought that was going to be the last piece. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3151.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3152.88s)]
*  And I think that's a good contract. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3153.28s)]
*  I don't know why to trade. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3154.92s)]
*  Wouldn't have traded for Sam Hauser over what they did with for the [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3156.88s)]
*  neck, getting Duncan Robinson back. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3160.2s)]
*  Why is Duncan Robinson making $16 million a year again? [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3162.24s)]
*  Didn't we already do this? [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3164.8799999999997s)]
*  Because Malik Beasley is in meshed and scandal, I think is the reason for that. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3165.8799999999997s)]
*  Would you rather have Sam Hauser at nine or, or Duncan Robinson at 16? [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3171.0s)]
*  I would rather have Sam Hauser personally. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3175.3599999999997s)]
*  And I don't understand that for a team like Detroit, where part of the reason [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3177.0s)]
*  that team is successful and effective is like, there aren't a lot of easy [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3180.96s)]
*  places to just attack and Sam Hauser. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3184.24s)]
*  I mean, I think that's the reason why they're so successful. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3186.44s)]
*  And Sam Hauser is like, you know, he's not an all world defender, but he's a [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3188.48s)]
*  better defender than Duncan Robinson. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3192.0s)]
*  He's proven to be the kind of guy that when you go at him, he can hold his ground. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3193.52s)]
*  It's just not going to be the case with Duncan. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3197.92s)]
*  And so I just think he's been so up and down. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3199.7200000000003s)]
*  I like them, but I thought he was going to be like, uh, like Tim, some of the [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3202.32s)]
*  guys that got veteran minimums are closer, even Yabba Selle getting two for 12, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3207.16s)]
*  which I thought was a really good sign in by the Knicks. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3211.6s)]
*  So he's worth two for 12, but Duncan Robinson's worth $15 million. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3214.76s)]
*  Three for 45. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3218.44s)]
*  Doesn't make sense. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3220.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3222.08s)]
*  Um, which leads me to my next thing, the Pistons who lose Beasley, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3223.2000000000003s)]
*  Hardaway, Fonteneggio and Schroeder from last year's team. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3227.8s)]
*  They added Kara Silver and Duncan Robinson so far. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3232.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3236.68s)]
*  I thought they had the assets to make a real move to do something and they [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3238.4s)]
*  didn't, and I don't even think they went sideways. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3244.76s)]
*  I think they probably dipped a level, but it felt maybe they believe in Ron [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3247.68s)]
*  Hall and maybe they live in Ossare Thompson and Jalen Duran. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3251.12s)]
*  Maybe they don't want to do the big move yet, but if you don't do big, big [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3254.44s)]
*  move yet, why are you doing this Duncan Robinson contract? [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3257.68s)]
*  I just felt like that's a team that should have aggressively [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3260.9199999999996s)]
*  gone after Jalen Brown. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3263.8799999999997s)]
*  And I don't know whether they would have gotten them, but I think [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3266.08s)]
*  that's how they had to think. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3268.64s)]
*  Like you got to, and maybe Durant didn't want to go there, but that's the [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3269.9199999999996s)]
*  other guy you could have thought of. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3273.3199999999997s)]
*  But for sure. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3274.48s)]
*  I think Jalen Brown, whatever their version of a Siakam trade was that [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3275.24s)]
*  Indiana made a couple of years ago. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3279.24s)]
*  I think this was the summer to do it. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3280.56s)]
*  They had weird assets and some cap space and some expirings and they just didn't [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3282.2s)]
*  do it, and I think they're in a worst place. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3286.7999999999997s)]
*  I think they definitely could have made a move like that to the extent that one [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3288.88s)]
*  was available, like maybe Kevin Durant just doesn't want to go to Detroit. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3292.48s)]
*  So they certainly weren't on his shortlist that was released. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3295.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3297.8399999999997s)]
*  Maybe the Celtics didn't want to trade Jalen Brown. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3298.4s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3300.44s)]
*  And so maybe it's just a matter of like the right guy is not available for us at [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3300.96s)]
*  this time. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3303.92s)]
*  And so even though Bain was available, he was, but does he level up the pistons in [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3304.4s)]
*  the way that ultimately I think they want to level up at some point? [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3309.6s)]
*  I don't know that Desmond Bain is a great addition for the magic. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3312.28s)]
*  Ultimately, like Detroit is looking for something a little bit different. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3316.28s)]
*  They are looking for shooting though. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3319.0s)]
*  And so I think the reason you get into Duncan Robinson is ultimately because [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3320.2400000000002s)]
*  you're losing your two most prolific three point shooters from last season. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3323.56s)]
*  I'm assuming Beasley does not come back. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3327.04s)]
*  I guess we'll see if that's not the case. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3328.48s)]
*  Beasley stuff is really, did you deep dive some of that about all his financial [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3330.6s)]
*  problems the last five years? [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3334.68s)]
*  It's pretty dark. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3336.0s)]
*  It's quite dark. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3337.08s)]
*  I don't think he comes back. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3338.4s)]
*  I don't think so either. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3340.04s)]
*  And so if Beasley is out and Tim Hardaway Jr is out, now you really need someone to [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3341.2799999999997s)]
*  just space the floor. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3345.88s)]
*  And so maybe it turns into a panic signing as opposed to who do we have to trade to [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3346.84s)]
*  get Sam Houser per se. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3351.12s)]
*  But I think what they're banking on ultimately is not just like, will Ron [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3353.04s)]
*  Holland take a step? [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3357.08s)]
*  Will Jalen Durant take a step? [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3358.0s)]
*  It's getting Jaden Ivy back in particular and him taking a step forward feels like [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3359.68s)]
*  a huge component of this. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3364.48s)]
*  Plus I think there's enough reason with their young guys to think some of those [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3366.7599999999998s)]
*  guys are going to take a meaningful step forward and it's going to offset what [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3371.7999999999997s)]
*  we're losing with some of these losses over the off season. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3375.2799999999997s)]
*  So you wouldn't have traded Tobias Harris and Thompson and Fonteneggo and like [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3379.08s)]
*  four of your firsts for Jalen Brown because that probably would have been the [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3385.64s)]
*  trade. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3388.44s)]
*  Well, Fontecchio would have been untouchable for me. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3388.8399999999997s)]
*  I never would have traded him for anybody, including Duncan Robinson. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3390.72s)]
*  Of course Miami gets him. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3393.6s)]
*  I like that guy. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3394.04s)]
*  Miami's just adding guys that I really like. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3395.2s)]
*  Truly. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3397.8399999999997s)]
*  They didn't make my dozen topics I wanted to hit, but I just, they got a [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3398.68s)]
*  Yakashunis in the draft. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3403.16s)]
*  They turned Duncan and expiring of Fonteneggo. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3405.48s)]
*  They have the Roger expiring. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3409.0s)]
*  They do. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3410.7599999999998s)]
*  They've mobilized some assets that are all expirings for something, but they [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3411.6s)]
*  need to continue to mobilize because right now that collection of assets on [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3419.16s)]
*  paper, on a depth chart, it does not inspire confidence, but I do like them [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3423.96s)]
*  bringing back Davion Mitchell. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3428.7599999999998s)]
*  I thought he had a really nice, really nice season overall last year with [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3429.72s)]
*  Toronto to start and then coming to Miami, but really, really cool to see him [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3432.72s)]
*  like find his footing in the league. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3437.0s)]
*  Do you have any stock? [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3438.7599999999998s)]
*  I was an early holder, but then I, I bailed, you know, I bailed when he was [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3440.48s)]
*  having trouble, like, you know, beating out third and fourth string Sacramento [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3444.04s)]
*  Kings guards, uh, but you know, I'm back, I'm back on board. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3448.72s)]
*  I'm looking to invest again. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3451.72s)]
*  One more break and then we got to talk about the thing I'm the most excited to [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3453.36s)]
*  talk about. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3456.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3457.44s)]
*  Not the top topic, but my favorite topic. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3459.32s)]
*  I think the atrocious GM summit might be coming back. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3462.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3465.7999999999997s)]
*  We have. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3466.08s)]
*  Who's invited? [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3466.7599999999998s)]
*  We have five teams that have just said to the, like they basically, it's [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3467.88s)]
*  like the American express black card where they're just like, yeah, I'm all in. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3473.12s)]
*  What are the fees? [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3477.8s)]
*  We have five teams that are just like, what are the fees to the atrocious [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3479.4s)]
*  GM summit, because we'd like to order the deluxe package. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3482.48s)]
*  So we have Phoenix, obviously they've ruined their short term and their long [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3486.04s)]
*  term and nobody knows what the fuck they're doing. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3490.4s)]
*  So there's one. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3493.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3494.92s)]
*  We have new Orleans. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3495.7599999999998s)]
*  There's Zagan, there's zag in it's like, here's Kavan, looney. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3498.0s)]
*  He's going to play with Jeremiah fears. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3501.4s)]
*  Who's 13 years old. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3503.08s)]
*  We're trading next year's unprotected first. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3504.3599999999997s)]
*  We're not in like, you know, the MPJ for cam Johnson and you get an asset [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3507.12s)]
*  business where they could have done a better version of the trade with trade [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3513.24s)]
*  Murphy, they're not doing that. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3516.3199999999997s)]
*  They're trading McCollum. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3517.7599999999998s)]
*  They're getting Jordan pullback. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3518.72s)]
*  They're all over the place. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3520.48s)]
*  Nobody can keep track of it. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3521.68s)]
*  The league is like, who's running this team? [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3523.52s)]
*  What's happening? [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3525.6s)]
*  Did they know they could protect picks? [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3526.36s)]
*  So there's two Chicago feels like they're being run by an AI engine that broke [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3527.96s)]
*  that, and the only thing they put in was we don't want to pay the luxury tax. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3537.24s)]
*  Could you suggest some moves for us? [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3540.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3542.44s)]
*  And the engine was like trade Lonzo ball for Isaac Acura, even though you [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3543.12s)]
*  already have Patrick Williams do that. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3547.2s)]
*  Can you make any sense of that roster? [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3550.68s)]
*  No, I cannot. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3553.4s)]
*  What is that roster? [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3553.92s)]
*  Well, we're still waiting for the Josh Giddy resigning, which I'm sure is [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3555.16s)]
*  coming at this point, like I don't know who else would realistically offer it, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3559.8s)]
*  be able to offer him a deal that would be competitive. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3562.92s)]
*  If that turns out to be a really rich, above market contract, I would be even [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3565.92s)]
*  more at a loss as to what they're doing. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3573.56s)]
*  And this is a team I already just do not fundamentally understand the [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3575.08s)]
*  motivations of the moves that they make, except that they are pointed pretty [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3578.16s)]
*  squarely at like, can we be the ninth best team in the Eastern conference [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3581.12s)]
*  perpetually until the day we die? [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3584.96s)]
*  So I go 40 and 42 and not pay the luxury tax forever. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3587.12s)]
*  You know, everyone has a dream and I salute them for committing to theirs. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3590.8s)]
*  In what world would anyone want to pay $29 million a year for [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3596.2799999999997s)]
*  Patrick Williams and Isaac Acura? [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3600.2s)]
*  Can you imagine doing that in a, in a, in a war, in a league where the salary cap, [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3602.0s)]
*  where smart spending has become more important than ever, and this is their [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3606.6s)]
*  idea to do that. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3610.64s)]
*  And I actually liked Lonzo in that team. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3611.88s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3614.12s)]
*  And for Cleveland, that was a godsend. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3614.64s)]
*  It was like, oh cool. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3616.52s)]
*  Now we can let Ty Jerome go and we'll just replace him with Lonzo. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3617.56s)]
*  The most charitable way you could interpret it for the Bulls is we [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3621.2400000000002s)]
*  traded for a guy who was just like more healthy and available to play than [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3624.44s)]
*  Lonzo Ball has ever been. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3627.96s)]
*  I still, I still like Lonzo Ball better. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3629.2s)]
*  I still like the guy who actually changes something about your team and the [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3630.92s)]
*  complexion of it versus, as you said, kind of shorter Patrick. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3634.0s)]
*  You know what? [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3637.3199999999997s)]
*  I actually like Isaac Acura better than Patrick Williams. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3637.7599999999998s)]
*  The pet, I don't know where Patrick Williams fell. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3640.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't know where he fell in your worst contracts draft with Wausenhaus. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3642.2s)]
*  I mean, it's a, it's a real doozy. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3646.44s)]
*  It does not make any sense. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3648.48s)]
*  You get $90 million for five years. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3649.56s)]
*  I don't know who they're competing against. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3650.92s)]
*  And you just had to give them the player option. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3652.24s)]
*  It was very important that you get the player option. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3653.7999999999997s)]
*  It was very important that you get the player option. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3656.0s)]
*  And then they had that goofy draft where why didn't they do the Derek Queen trade? [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3657.72s)]
*  They could trade the 12th pick to New Orleans. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3663.0s)]
*  It got New Orleans is first next year, but they never seem to do anything that. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3665.16s)]
*  So they're, they're a must for the atrocious GM summit. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3668.7599999999998s)]
*  That's three teams. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3671.7599999999998s)]
*  Sacramento going from Fox and Hal Burton to overpaying Dennis Schroeder, who I [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3673.8799999999997s)]
*  think this is now his A team. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3681.16s)]
*  And I kind of liked Dennis Schroeder. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3682.64s)]
*  I don't know if I'm going to be able to get a better team. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3684.4399999999996s)]
*  I liked Dennis Schroeder. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3686.08s)]
*  I don't know if I like them for three years, $48 million or whatever he got. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3687.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3691.2799999999997s)]
*  And now you just have this expensive roster that, um, are you the 11th seed or the 13th seed? [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3691.56s)]
*  What are the things going to happen with this team? [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3699.2799999999997s)]
*  Who wants to see all these players together on the same team? [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3701.88s)]
*  And there's a lot of like rumored activity around them trying to basically [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3705.32s)]
*  dump Malik monk in various trades. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3708.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3711.52s)]
*  Why? [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3711.72s)]
*  I don't really understand other than there's just like a bunch of guards that [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3712.48s)]
*  trying to find minutes minutes for, including, you know, Devin Carter, who [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3715.4s)]
*  didn't get a fully healthy rookie season. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3718.2000000000003s)]
*  So like, he's going to get a chance to kind of come back and prove something. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3719.84s)]
*  But this is just like a bad outcome for so many of these guys. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3722.56s)]
*  Like I was really hoping post bulls that Demarja Rosen and Zach [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3726.76s)]
*  Levine would get chances with winning teams again, that Zach Levine would go [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3732.0s)]
*  somewhere like Denver and we'd be like, Oh my God, this guy really is one of the [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3735.6s)]
*  best shooters in the world. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3739.08s)]
*  His head is screwed on straight. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3740.04s)]
*  Like everything is finally clicking for this guy after years and years in [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3741.2400000000002s)]
*  various wildernesses has not happened. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3744.36s)]
*  Clearly Demarja Rosen could have held any number of potential contending teams. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3746.88s)]
*  Instead, he's tasked with like trying to be the third kind of triangulated piece [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3751.52s)]
*  of first with Fox and Sabonis now with Levine and Sabonis like pairings that [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3756.28s)]
*  just like do not work and anchor you inside the arc at a time when it just does [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3760.32s)]
*  not work in terms of producing high level offense. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3765.1600000000003s)]
*  I just, I hope for so much more for so many of these guys and yet their fate is [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3768.36s)]
*  apparently playing together. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3771.88s)]
*  It's so weird that they had that the two seed was all looking good. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3773.4s)]
*  The Halbert and Sabonis trade, which I disagreed with, but at least like, [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3778.56s)]
*  okay, at least you guys won 48 games. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3781.8s)]
*  You got some, got some stuff going on. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3783.8s)]
*  You have pretty clean salary cap and now it's a mess. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3786.08s)]
*  They have the third worst odds on Fandl to win the West. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3789.56s)]
*  Utah's the worst Portland second worst Sacramento has worse odds than New [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3792.8s)]
*  Orleans and Phoenix. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3798.7200000000003s)]
*  How about that? [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3800.84s)]
*  And they're just, this is not a team that should be like, you know, it might [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3802.2000000000003s)]
*  help us three years, 48 million for Dennis Schroeder. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3806.48s)]
*  I wouldn't do that. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3810.28s)]
*  Uh, anyway, they're our fourth invite. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3811.2000000000003s)]
*  I also would not rule out the idea of the trailblazers just having a better [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3813.2000000000003s)]
*  regular season record than the Kinks. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3817.36s)]
*  That feels fully possible to me. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3819.52s)]
*  Oh, I would, I would bet on that. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3821.48s)]
*  I think Portland's definitely going to be better than them. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3823.92s)]
*  Don't you think? [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3825.84s)]
*  You said they had lower odds, no? [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3826.44s)]
*  You're right. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3830.2400000000002s)]
*  They do have lower odds. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3830.7599999999998s)]
*  Like, I think I might, that's a proposition that makes sense to me. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3832.2s)]
*  Why does Portland have lower odds than Sacramento? [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3835.48s)]
*  I don't really know. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3837.12s)]
*  I kind of like Portland. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3839.12s)]
*  They're going to be a Portland. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3840.6s)]
*  I think they're going to be really tough to play. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3841.56s)]
*  They're going to be good defensively and chemistry will be better than [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3843.2799999999997s)]
*  the other, they don't have Aitin. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3846.9199999999996s)]
*  Um, and then the fifth team for the Attrust is, so we have Phoenix, we have [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3848.16s)]
*  New Orleans, we have Chicago, we have Sacramento. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3851.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm sorry, Brooklyn's got to go in there. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3854.56s)]
*  What are you doing Brooklyn? [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3857.0s)]
*  Can we just go over this for a second? [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3858.2799999999997s)]
*  Please. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3859.9599999999996s)]
*  You're the only team with cap space. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3861.2s)]
*  It's just you guys. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3864.08s)]
*  You ha you have the chance to get to like, what 80, 90 million. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3865.56s)]
*  If you were announced some guys, nobody else has anything. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3869.48s)]
*  This is like, this is a gift. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3872.64s)]
*  You're basically in a fantasy football draft and all of your idiot friends have [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3874.7999999999997s)]
*  spent all their money and you have like a hundred dollars left to just go and [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3879.04s)]
*  swoop in and grab everybody and they don't do that. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3883.8399999999997s)]
*  They basically, they turn the cap space plus cam Johnson into Michael Porter [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3888.2400000000002s)]
*  Jr. Terrence man, the 22nd pick in Denver's 2032 first, which is seven years from now. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3896.0800000000004s)]
*  And I promise you, Sean, Marks will not be the GM then not to mention the five [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3901.96s)]
*  firsts that they took that I don't think anybody really liked any of them. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3906.5200000000004s)]
*  Brooklyn is like kind of the stealth people around the league going, what the [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3910.6800000000003s)]
*  fuck is going on with that team team? [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3914.4s)]
*  I don't know what's going on, but this is a team that they could have used that [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3916.56s)]
*  cap space. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3919.92s)]
*  They could have made a giddy restricted free agent offer. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3920.6s)]
*  They could have done, you know, try to steal cominga. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3924.12s)]
*  There's still some good restricted free agents left. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3927.2799999999997s)]
*  Like they could have tried to screw Philly on Quentin Grimes, like use the cap [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3929.3199999999997s)]
*  space and where conversely here's another, another one I wanted to do tied to this. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3933.2799999999997s)]
*  Like, like, well, we'll talk about them later, but Charlotte, who I think is now [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3939.72s)]
*  doing it the way you should do it. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3943.7599999999998s)]
*  We're like, let me use our cap space to grab assets and get picks from people. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3945.0s)]
*  Um, and just kind of, we're just kind of collecting. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3950.72s)]
*  We're here. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3954.64s)]
*  If you want to get rid of your dumb thing, you want to get rid of, we'll [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3955.52s)]
*  hoard your stuff. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3959.12s)]
*  I don't understand Brooklyn at all. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3961.48s)]
*  Do you? [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3962.9599999999996s)]
*  I do not. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3964.04s)]
*  I don't, I mean, look, the shape of the team right now, I don't think was ever [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3965.3199999999997s)]
*  going to make a ton of sense. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3968.7999999999997s)]
*  Like they're kind of still too early in their process, which is not what you [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3970.0s)]
*  want to hear, but given their relative lack of ability to add players outside [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3972.84s)]
*  of free agency, it was just kind of, it was what it was that said. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3976.84s)]
*  I don't like the opportunities that we talked about, like using your cap [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3980.7200000000003s)]
*  space in that fashion for Terrence man does not check out is not a good use of [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3983.88s)]
*  the market is not a good way to leverage kind of the one thing that you have at [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3988.04s)]
*  your disposal. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3991.32s)]
*  Cam Johnson is another one who we like, we've been talking about for years now [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3993.32s)]
*  as a potential trade target for various teams. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3996.6400000000003s)]
*  Michael Porter Jr. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=3999.28s)]
*  Is a really good player to the Denver Nuggets. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4000.0s)]
*  I think he in a proven champion, a really important part of that run. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4002.2s)]
*  I don't want to diminish what he does or what he did for that team. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4006.2s)]
*  What does he do for the Brooklyn Nets? [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4009.72s)]
*  Like is he, is he a potentially a part of the next great Nets team? [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4011.2799999999997s)]
*  I find it hard to believe that that would be the case. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4015.2s)]
*  I think it's probably more likely he plays out this season and then I guess is [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4017.2799999999997s)]
*  a trade candidate for next year in terms of finding his way to another team. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4021.16s)]
*  $17 million more than Cam Johnson, which is a crucial piece of this. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4024.0s)]
*  Another crucial piece of it. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4027.72s)]
*  So like they don't have a roster that makes sense. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4028.9199999999996s)]
*  They don't have a future that makes sense. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4031.08s)]
*  They don't have a lot of prospects who it's like, Oh, I really believe in [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4032.8s)]
*  that one guy in particular. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4035.92s)]
*  And that's, that's kind of the worst place to be as a franchise when none of [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4037.84s)]
*  those things are clicking. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4040.4s)]
*  I, and then on top of it, it all starts with that weird trade they made to get [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4043.16s)]
*  their picks back where they paid a premium price and traded the Phoenix picks away. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4046.36s)]
*  Which there's just no scenario for Phoenix to be good over the next couple of years. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4053.6s)]
*  And instead banked on themselves to suck. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4057.88s)]
*  Well, is there a scenario for the next to be good? [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4060.12s)]
*  Well, but last year they hired a coach who made them so competitive. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4062.6s)]
*  They had to like start turning a major league and they ended up with the eighth [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4066.88s)]
*  pick instead of the top five. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4070.0s)]
*  So this is the year that they're going all in on. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4071.6s)]
*  We only have four tanking teams. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4073.6s)]
*  Yeah, that's going to be one of them. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4075.24s)]
*  But I just like, uh, we have a news as we're talking that Mike Brown is [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4076.64s)]
*  officially the Knicks coach, which we were expecting for a while. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4082.88s)]
*  So Mike Brown and Rick Brunson will now be running the Knicks. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4086.88s)]
*  Um, I disagree with everything Brooklyn's done. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4090.44s)]
*  I didn't like their draft. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4094.24s)]
*  I didn't like how they use their cap space. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4095.52s)]
*  I would have gone after cominga. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4097.28s)]
*  I just feel like cominga sitting there, but do the G even if it's like one [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4100.04s)]
*  year, 25 million, like why not? [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4105.04s)]
*  Like maybe there's something really there. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4107.2s)]
*  I just, I just like, why am I doing Terrence Mayen over cominga? [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4108.96s)]
*  So I get the 22nd pick. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4113.08s)]
*  Um, so there's five. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4115.36s)]
*  So can you make a case for Milwaukee is the sixth after that Dame Lillard trade? [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4117.2s)]
*  If we need, I feel like I need seven teams to have an official [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4122.6s)]
*  trust is jammed some day at the quorum. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4126.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4128.8s)]
*  Is Milwaukee invited now after the Kuzma and Dame Lillard stretch, but also [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4129.5599999999995s)]
*  the Dame Lillard trade itself? [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4134.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4137.32s)]
*  Well, the day you invite them, the Dame trade I would have done. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4138.6s)]
*  I would have traded for Damien Lillard in the first place. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4142.64s)]
*  I still see the logic in that. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4144.8s)]
*  Like that one you can sell me on Kuzma. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4146.92s)]
*  I hated that deal. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4149.64s)]
*  We were covering it with was at the deadline pod. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4150.88s)]
*  The moment it happened, hated it. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4153.4800000000005s)]
*  Was on an island. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4155.6s)]
*  Kuzma Island and that Kuzma Island has been overrun by the ocean. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4157.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4160.96s)]
*  He is marooned. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4161.16s)]
*  He will, we will not be sending the rescue boat for was on Kuzma Island. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4162.320000000001s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4165.6s)]
*  Sometimes you do it to yourself. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4165.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4168.2s)]
*  This one is tough because I think it really does depend on what you [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4169.2s)]
*  think the brief for that job is. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4172.8s)]
*  If you're the general manager of the Milwaukee Bucks is your job to retain [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4174.72s)]
*  Yannis at all costs, to retain one of the best players in the world, one of [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4178.4400000000005s)]
*  the best players in the history of the league at all costs, or is it to care [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4182.2s)]
*  about what your team is going to look like three years from now? [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4186.84s)]
*  I think different general managers and especially in different markets, see [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4189.4400000000005s)]
*  that job differently and see that brief differently. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4192.2s)]
*  And so from our perspective, this is a rash, crazy, just like completely [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4194.400000000001s)]
*  unprecedented and insane move in terms of the amount of money that they've [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4199.360000000001s)]
*  just added to their books that will be completely dead. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4202.4400000000005s)]
*  But if it works in terms of keeping Yannis, like I, maybe the results just [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4205.400000000001s)]
*  edge you out of the atrocious GM conversation. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4209.56s)]
*  It sounds like they're a fun ad. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4212.320000000001s)]
*  We could argue about whether they did a good job or not. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4214.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4216.88s)]
*  Just get them a box lunch, put them at the table and we'll have a conversation. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4217.76s)]
*  I would love as my last team, I would love to invite the Toronto Raptors. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4222.320000000001s)]
*  We need to get to seven. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4226.88s)]
*  The Brandon Ingram trade seems hilarious now. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4229.56s)]
*  They trade a first round pick so they could acquire Brandon Ingram and then [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4231.88s)]
*  give him a 38 this year, 40 and then 41. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4235.68s)]
*  So basically three for 120. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4241.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4244.08s)]
*  And now we've seen Julius Randall signed for 33 and Nas Reed signed for 25. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4245.400000000001s)]
*  And some guys even going miles Turner around 25. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4250.08s)]
*  And I think as an asset, he's in that range so that he's overpaid. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4252.88s)]
*  They're paying quickly 32.5 million a year. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4256.92s)]
*  32.5 million a year. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4260.04s)]
*  They're paying RJ Barrett 27.7, 29. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4263.28s)]
*  They're paying Pertle 19 and 19 and then just gave them an extension for [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4267.32s)]
*  26, 28 and 30. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4270.72s)]
*  And then they gave Scotty Barnes a max. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4273.32s)]
*  Scotty Barnes is going to be making 51 million in the 2030 season. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4275.4s)]
*  They've somehow managed to overpay their top five players by 20%. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4279.36s)]
*  And I think that earns them an invite. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4284.16s)]
*  They have somehow wound up on, on SpowTracks, like total cap allocations [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4286.56s)]
*  in terms of the commitments for that roster. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4291.0s)]
*  The Toronto Raptors have the 12th most expensive roster in the league right now. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4293.200000000001s)]
*  They are just below the Denver Nuggets. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4296.360000000001s)]
*  They are just above the Sixers, the Magic, the Kings, who we were just [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4299.4400000000005s)]
*  talking about, the Clippers, the Rockets, the Wolves, like this is a [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4303.68s)]
*  wildly expensive team for a lot of guys. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4307.4800000000005s)]
*  I kind of like to sometimes like to like, like there's no one who you're over [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4310.68s)]
*  the moon about save for. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4315.32s)]
*  I would say like Scotty Barnes is long-term potential. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4316.759999999999s)]
*  I am bought in on. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4318.759999999999s)]
*  I think Scotty Barnes is already a very good player, will be even better than that. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4319.48s)]
*  But as soon as you start making those sorts of financial commitments to [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4324.24s)]
*  Emmanuel quickly, like I, you know, it's like, Oh, I was really, I really liked [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4327.08s)]
*  him as a Nick and then all of a sudden you have to pay him $30 million. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4330.24s)]
*  That's a different thing. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4333.44s)]
*  As soon as you're importing Brandon Ingram to bail out an offense that had [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4334.32s)]
*  nothing going for it last season, you've kind of lost me. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4337.5199999999995s)]
*  And frankly, I think you've lost the plot a little bit. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4340.48s)]
*  And so there's a lot of good players here, but they're not good players. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4342.32s)]
*  That I think make a lot of sense together. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4345.28s)]
*  I say this, look Raptors fans. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4347.12s)]
*  I know the late season defense really popped. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4349.36s)]
*  I know it worked really well. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4351.92s)]
*  I know there's a vision here for a thing that could happen late season. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4353.0s)]
*  Look at the Raptors buzz. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4356.96s)]
*  There was a little bit of like, Oh, sneaky, like top 10 defense [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4358.32s)]
*  late in the season kind of push. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4361.88s)]
*  I don't, I don't think that's like a lasting foundational element of this [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4364.36s)]
*  roster that you can just sort of hang your hat on, like this is a team that's [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4369.0s)]
*  to go in and prove it all over again and prove that it can be something cohesive [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4371.92s)]
*  that can actually have any kind of results whatsoever. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4377.08s)]
*  And for that to be one of the more expensive rosters in the league, I [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4379.64s)]
*  think is a little bit crazy. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4382.56s)]
*  This team had two playoff guys that we know are playoff guys, because we [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4384.08s)]
*  watched them in the playoffs play each other in OG and an OB and Pascal Siakam. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4387.360000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4392.92s)]
*  They traded both of them. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4393.96s)]
*  They turned in an OB into quickly and RJ Barrett and they turned Siakam into [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4396.240000000001s)]
*  like a number one pick and some crap that they then turned into Brandon Ingram, [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4400.92s)]
*  who I don't know is a playoff guy. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4404.4800000000005s)]
*  Um, whatever their roster is. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4406.56s)]
*  So right now in FanDuel, these are teams that have better odds in them than [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4409.28s)]
*  the one in the East, Cleveland, New York, Orlando, Atlanta, Boston. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4413.28s)]
*  Don't understand that Philly, Detroit, Milwaukee, Indiana, and then Toronto. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4416.92s)]
*  So they have the 10th best odds to win the East and, uh, I'll book those [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4422.56s)]
*  bets from anybody anyway. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4430.639999999999s)]
*  That's our atrocious GM summit. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4432.24s)]
*  Well, you know, what's crazy about this summit is that almost all those teams [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4433.5199999999995s)]
*  have already recently fired general managers and they are trying like Messiah [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4437.36s)]
*  Jury's just out the door or about to, but like some of those got fired three [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4442.2s)]
*  months ago and the new people who have come in have already taken up the mantle. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4446.2s)]
*  Really a true passing of the torch moment in terms of like, you know what? [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4450.599999999999s)]
*  We're just going to keep the seat for the New Orleans Pelicans and one person, [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4453.679999999999s)]
*  like we're just going to, one is going to follow the other. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4457.5599999999995s)]
*  I'll be quick on the rest of this. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4460.5199999999995s)]
*  So Cleveland didn't overreact. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4462.0s)]
*  Congrats to them. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4466.16s)]
*  I think they're the East favorites. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4467.24s)]
*  They basically turned Ty Jerome and a Coro Nalanzo. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4468.5599999999995s)]
*  Other than that, trust the process. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4471.08s)]
*  I don't think teams do this enough. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4473.92s)]
*  We talked about Rosselle and I talked about on Sunday night, like in the [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4476.36s)]
*  eighties and the nineties, when you do, when the title was like, Oh my God, [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4478.84s)]
*  what are we in the, like the Lakers, like trading Byron Scott, like they [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4481.84s)]
*  wouldn't have done that and Cleveland didn't overreact. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4484.88s)]
*  I think they're still the favorites in the East. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4488.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4490.4800000000005s)]
*  Are they technically the favorites? [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4490.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4492.0s)]
*  Um, they would be the team if my life depended on it and I would pick. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4492.76s)]
*  And I think they're fine and they just need Garland to be healthy. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4496.12s)]
*  And, you know, they got, they got sucker punched in the playoffs and it was [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4498.8s)]
*  embarrassing, but maybe ultimately a good thing for them, Minnesota and the [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4504.04s)]
*  Knicks remain legit contenders, which I wasn't positive would be the case as [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4509.04s)]
*  we headed into the off season, right? [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4514.32s)]
*  And we don't need to belabor this, but Minnesota kept Randall and Nas and [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4515.96s)]
*  the Knicks got Clarkson and yeah, the Selly, they finally have a coach. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4519.6s)]
*  I would say, would you agree with this? [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4523.96s)]
*  It's Minnesota, the Knicks, Houston and Cleveland, one level below KC. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4525.4400000000005s)]
*  And as our next four, Oh, in Denver. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4530.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4532.96s)]
*  My bad. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4533.24s)]
*  And Denver. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4533.92s)]
*  So that's the next five after, after, okay. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4534.4400000000005s)]
*  See with okay. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4540.08s)]
*  See levitating above everybody, but Minnesota, Knicks, Houston, Denver, [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4540.84s)]
*  Cleveland, I think that's the next five. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4544.68s)]
*  I think okay. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4547.320000000001s)]
*  See is levitating above everybody, but it is cool that Houston and Denver are, [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4547.92s)]
*  are taking a run, that they are, that they are adding pieces, that they are [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4552.76s)]
*  gathering momentum, that they're saying like, like we think there's an opportunity [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4556.0s)]
*  to challenge even a team as great as the thunder. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4559.4400000000005s)]
*  I that's, that's an exciting thing for the league. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4561.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4563.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, what's interesting is Vanduul and this is betting behavior, right? [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4564.08s)]
*  It's not them putting the odds. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4568.08s)]
*  So just trying to get bets, but they have as the top five, Oklahoma city, [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4569.16s)]
*  Knicks, Cleveland, Houston, Denver, but Minnesota is not six. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4573.76s)]
*  They have Orlando with better odds and then the Lakers, which is just [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4577.4800000000005s)]
*  Laker fans betting them, but they have Minnesota at 17 to one. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4580.400000000001s)]
*  And Denver's at nine to one. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4584.0s)]
*  Orlando's at 12 to one. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4585.400000000001s)]
*  But so the betting public doesn't seem to believe in Minnesota in the same way. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4586.6s)]
*  But I think keeping Randall and Nas and, um, kind of the nucleus of what they had, [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4590.92s)]
*  I do think they should be in the conversation, right? [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4596.4800000000005s)]
*  That's not crazy. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4598.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, Vegas just doesn't love Terrence Shannon like we do, you know? [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4599.24s)]
*  True. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4602.92s)]
*  This is the Luke, ours, the thing. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4603.5599999999995s)]
*  Maybe they got a little scared off. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4605.12s)]
*  You know, they lost some really critical pieces there, but honestly losing Nikhil [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4607.0s)]
*  Alexander Walker is a real thing. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4610.68s)]
*  And one of Terrence Shannon, like honestly, it would be great if Jalen Clark could kind [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4612.639999999999s)]
*  of round out his game a little bit. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4617.28s)]
*  It would be great if like the Dillingham minutes turn into anything at all. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4618.76s)]
*  Um, well they have to for what they gave up. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4622.24s)]
*  He's going to have to play next year, but that's a back to back Western [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4624.36s)]
*  conference, like, uh, finals team. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4627.639999999999s)]
*  Like to just write them off, I think would be insane. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4629.639999999999s)]
*  Like they did good work in retaining what they had. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4632.04s)]
*  I have those five. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4635.0s)]
*  I think Atlanta and Orlando are kind of lurking as something. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4637.12s)]
*  And then there's a couple more in there, but, uh, two more restricted free agency. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4641.68s)]
*  It seems like it's dead or in a coma. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4646.32s)]
*  We don't even have a giddy or commit like whatever they did with the CBA, they [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4648.8s)]
*  made restricted free agency impossible. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4652.16s)]
*  So now you basically have to get your deal done a year before you become a [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4654.44s)]
*  restricted free agent because you don't want to be in the position of now maybe [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4659.32s)]
*  next year, more teams will have cap space, but the fact that nobody made a giddy [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4663.36s)]
*  offer or camp Thomas offer, I thought was pretty crazy. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4668.679999999999s)]
*  Is it crazy that nobody made a camp Thomas offer the way the history of the [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4672.36s)]
*  league is like teams year after year. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4675.679999999999s)]
*  Be like, oh, Sacramento offered camp Thomas three for 50. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4678.36s)]
*  None of those deals are out there. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4682.12s)]
*  If we don't see cam Thomas in a Sacramento Kings Jersey at some point, like [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4683.719999999999s)]
*  it'll happen. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4686.8s)]
*  Then AI has fully taken over. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4687.4800000000005s)]
*  But I think the one that fingers crossed, the one I'm kind of watching is Quinton [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4689.08s)]
*  Grimes because yes, like a lottery team making a big run at a Josh giddy or [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4692.360000000001s)]
*  Jonathan comingo, like that's historically something that has happened. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4698.04s)]
*  Quinton Grimes is in this range. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4701.0s)]
*  We've got a good rotation player who could help a bunch of different teams, but [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4702.08s)]
*  his market is limited artificially by that restriction would not shock me to see [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4705.16s)]
*  him take the qualifying offer and then go next summer and be able to sign with the [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4709.6s)]
*  team of his choosing, like obviously it was really good for Philly. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4713.360000000001s)]
*  I think we'll be really good for them again. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4716.28s)]
*  I'm going to end with my 12th one as on a, on a positive. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4718.679999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4721.759999999999s)]
*  The Charlotte Hornets, new owner, new coach, new front office, a perennial [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4723.639999999999s)]
*  shit show. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4729.32s)]
*  You could always rely that just an automatic invite to the atrocious GM [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4730.88s)]
*  summit every year. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4734.96s)]
*  And now they're basically they they're, they're doing AI Sam Presti. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4737.48s)]
*  This is an AI heavy episode. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4743.24s)]
*  I gotta say. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4744.5599999999995s)]
*  Kind of playing the, uh, the Presti hits, right? [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4745.44s)]
*  It's like there, it seems like their mode is what would Sam Presti do. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4748.0s)]
*  And that's how you end up. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4752.5199999999995s)]
*  You trade Nurkic, you get sextant in a good second. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4753.4s)]
*  You trade Meechish for Conaton in two seconds knowing he's going to retire. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4756.28s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4761.639999999999s)]
*  We'll take Conaton for you. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4762.04s)]
*  Just adding picks. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4763.16s)]
*  You trade Mark Williams for the 29th. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4764.4s)]
*  Pick in the draft and in 2029 first, uh, during the season, they traded a [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4767.5599999999995s)]
*  Koji and, uh, Nick Richards for a Koji in three seconds. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4772.32s)]
*  And then early in this, in this whole thing, they traded a Lowry or Rozier [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4775.5599999999995s)]
*  for Lowry in Miami is 2027 first. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4780.679999999999s)]
*  So they're doing what a bad team should do. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4782.92s)]
*  Yes. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4785.28s)]
*  It's like, we'll grab assets here, but now I look at their team and they got [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4786.0s)]
*  LaMelo, they have miles Bridges who was good last year, uh, can nipple. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4790.679999999999s)]
*  They, uh, they have Brandon Miller coming back somehow the same wrist [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4796.16s)]
*  injury is Jalen Williams who played all through the season, you know, just [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4800.36s)]
*  tanking team versus team trying to win the title. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4804.679999999999s)]
*  Um, but I like where they are. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4807.08s)]
*  And I think that it looks like a smart team to me. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4809.36s)]
*  And now one more shady season, one more good draft pick, and then [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4811.92s)]
*  maybe something's there, right? [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4816.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think a lot of it's going to bank on LaMelo and how much you believe in him. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4819.08s)]
*  I, I kind of do like, I'm, I'm still a LaMelo guy. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4822.08s)]
*  I'm still a believer. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4825.4s)]
*  I think you have to see it. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4826.719999999999s)]
*  Uh, but ultimately you're right. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4828.04s)]
*  It's like the function of like, are you running this team? [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4829.72s)]
*  Well, it's like, what are the opportunities you actually have? [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4832.12s)]
*  And if you're a team like the Hornets, they are making a lot with those [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4834.4800000000005s)]
*  opportunities, they're, they're leveraging them really, really well. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4837.52s)]
*  Given where they are, given the fact that like free agents are not going to be [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4840.52s)]
*  clamoring to come sign with the Hornets at bargain rates. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4843.320000000001s)]
*  So you draft well, you get as many picks as you can. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4846.320000000001s)]
*  You take on trades like the Coniton trade, for example, and, and you live to fight [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4848.76s)]
*  another day and you try to consolidate some of this talent ultimately. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4852.88s)]
*  And like Brandon Miller being good is really important to the Hornets at this [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4855.8s)]
*  point, like he needs to pop and he needs to be able to like stay on the [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4859.48s)]
*  court and be healthy. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4862.759999999999s)]
*  And when he's done, like when he's been on the court, you can really see it. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4863.719999999999s)]
*  Like you can see the outline of a really effective two way wing player, but [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4867.32s)]
*  he's also got to do it. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4871.44s)]
*  It really is that kind of roster through and through where, yeah, I don't believe [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4872.36s)]
*  in the five man, eight man rotation that they're going to have on the court next [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4876.16s)]
*  season, but I believe in kind of the direction that they're going, which has [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4880.44s)]
*  not been the case lately. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4884.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4885.759999999999s)]
*  I think the league's noticing like, oh man, we don't have a Patsy over in [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4886.16s)]
*  Charlotte anymore. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4889.72s)]
*  Um, this will be like much. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4890.76s)]
*  We talked about with Trey Young, this will be the kind of, what do we have with [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4892.5599999999995s)]
*  the Mello is this somebody we should be building around or not? [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4895.48s)]
*  Um, that's all I got. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4898.12s)]
*  Is there anything I missed that you cared about for the, for the summer? [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4899.599999999999s)]
*  I feel like we hit everything. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4903.12s)]
*  I think we hit the biggest stuff. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4904.24s)]
*  So it sounds like the thing you're the most interested in is what, how this [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4906.16s)]
*  Lebron situation plays out. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4909.36s)]
*  I mean, I'm fascinated. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4911.0s)]
*  Just because look, we've already got had the start to a summer where, uh, [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4912.44s)]
*  uh, all NBA guard got waved and stretched out of nowhere so that a team that had [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4917.52s)]
*  no room could all of a sudden have tons of room. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4921.76s)]
*  Like, let's just get wild and crazy with it. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4923.76s)]
*  You know, like let's, I have no idea where the Lebron market can go right now. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4925.96s)]
*  It looks like there's only two or three teams that make sense. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4929.4s)]
*  Maybe that won't, maybe that won't be the case a week from now, a month from now, [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4932.24s)]
*  three months from now, I've, I have no idea how long it will stretch on, but. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4934.92s)]
*  Good Lord, the Lakers are in a weird place. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4939.88s)]
*  Like this is such a, such a clusterfuck for them. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4941.64s)]
*  They're in a weird place, but also in a pretty good place because they have a [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4944.92s)]
*  new owner and they have Luka Doncic. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4947.76s)]
*  So long-term great short-term. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4949.200000000001s)]
*  You're not a contender. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4952.08s)]
*  You're not. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4953.160000000001s)]
*  It's not happening. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4953.84s)]
*  And meanwhile, in Dallas, like I have seen the vision and it is giving me a [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4954.84s)]
*  continued migraine, like bringing in D'Angelo Russell as rent grade Kyrie. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4959.68s)]
*  I, what are, what are you doing? [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4963.56s)]
*  Did, was not a fan of that. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4966.6s)]
*  Why? [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4967.88s)]
*  Why? [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4968.4800000000005s)]
*  Not a fan. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4969.12s)]
*  That was not great. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4969.8s)]
*  What TV show are you obsessed with right now? [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4970.96s)]
*  None, unfortunately, because we are, we have a presumed innocent shaped hole in [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4973.16s)]
*  our lives, like we, I don't know where the summer schlock went, but it's not here. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4977.400000000001s)]
*  And I'm, I'm really sad about it. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4981.28s)]
*  So at least we have train wreck poop cruise. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4982.64s)]
*  Finally. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4985.04s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4986.64s)]
*  Netflix. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4988.04s)]
*  I, I, okay. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4988.84s)]
*  Pitch me on poop cruise. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4990.08s)]
*  What's going on with poop cruise? [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4991.04s)]
*  It's a show called train wreck. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4992.2s)]
*  And they did an hour long episode about the carnival boat cruise. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4993.76s)]
*  And everybody was stepping in shit and it's a riveting hour. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=4997.08s)]
*  You know what? [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5001.24s)]
*  I'm not up on the latest poops. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5001.72s)]
*  I gotta, I gotta get caught up on that. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5003.0s)]
*  What's weird is the Brooklyn nets and the Phoenix sons were on the, on the boat. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5005.0s)]
*  And a couple of the other teams, Sacramento Kings, Rob Mooney. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5009.24s)]
*  Great to see you as always. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5012.4s)]
*  Thanks. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5013.4s)]
*  Thanks Bill. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5013.96s)]
*  All right. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5015.28s)]
*  My dad's here. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5015.56s)]
*  We just had to say an official farewell to the, uh, 2024 world champion Boston [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5016.36s)]
*  Celtics. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5021.32s)]
*  Um, I don't know if we've talked to you, but I'm sure you've been to [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5021.88s)]
*  the last time we talked to you was after game two of the next series. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5025.0s)]
*  Um, you're, you're paying full boat for your season tickets this year. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5027.88s)]
*  And now drew holiday and poor Zingas and Jalen Brown and Al, not Jalen [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5032.56s)]
*  Brown, Jason Tatum and Al Horford will not be on the team. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5037.84s)]
*  It's, uh, you know, I really thought we had a three year one season. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5043.44s)]
*  We had a three year one season. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5048.72s)]
*  We had a three year one season. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5050.04s)]
*  You know, I really thought we had a three year window and, uh, I thought that [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5051.88s)]
*  the owners were going to be willing to pay the luxury tax and maybe if Tatum [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5057.48s)]
*  didn't get hurt, that's what would happen. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5062.12s)]
*  Uh, but I, you know, I fully understand the new owners, Bill Chisholm, then [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5064.76s)]
*  with Tatum out the whole year, we're not going to be a contender. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5070.599999999999s)]
*  Um, so I understand that poor Zingas, he had only one year left in his contract. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5074.719999999999s)]
*  I understand the holiday because he had three years left at his age and we're [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5080.12s)]
*  not going to be a contender. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5085.24s)]
*  I really hope that they would resign Cornett and, uh, and Al Horford, but [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5087.24s)]
*  it doesn't look like that's happening. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5094.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5096.4800000000005s)]
*  Horford is going to Golden State. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5096.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm reading. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5097.96s)]
*  But so next year is going to be, you know, we had a great championship year. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5099.2s)]
*  This year was exciting until it wasn't. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5106.32s)]
*  Uh, you roll with the punches. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5108.4s)]
*  You and I have talked a lot of times about all the dead years in between [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5110.839999999999s)]
*  championships, but you still, you still go, you still support your team. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5115.36s)]
*  You hope that they'll be better. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5120.16s)]
*  Am I looking forward to next year? [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5122.719999999999s)]
*  Not at all. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5124.599999999999s)]
*  Um, and I suspect your daughter and whomever will be going and sitting [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5126.0s)]
*  in my seats frequently. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5132.16s)]
*  We have no center and we're missing one of the five best guys in the league. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5133.72s)]
*  And our new shooting guard is one of the worst defenders in the league. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5138.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5142.96s)]
*  I'll be interested to see what you think of Anthony Simons, because you're not a [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5143.04s)]
*  league pass guy, especially in the wet with the West coast team. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5146.04s)]
*  So I don't, I don't think you've seen him that much. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5148.72s)]
*  I, I saw, I actually went to the Portland game and I saw him and he did very well [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5151.320000000001s)]
*  against us actually, we, we had a great game, but we were not going to be [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5155.76s)]
*  the best guys in the league. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5159.92s)]
*  So I don't think you've seen him that much. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5160.68s)]
*  I saw him and he did very well against us. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5161.76s)]
*  Actually. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5163.8s)]
*  We, his shooting was excellent the night that he played us. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5164.24s)]
*  I don't remember defense because I wasn't paying attention to that, but, um, but [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5169.8s)]
*  you know, there's so many rumors now that he's going to be packaged. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5175.08s)]
*  So, so, cause from what I understand that they're now a little bit above [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5178.8s)]
*  the second apron again, so somebody has to go. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5183.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5186.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5187.2s)]
*  I would trade Hauser and I was surprised. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5187.5599999999995s)]
*  Robin Hoeney and I just talked about, I thought he might go to Detroit, but they [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5189.5199999999995s)]
*  ended up doing Duncan Robinson instead, but I still feel like Hauser is probably [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5192.32s)]
*  going to get traded would be my guess. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5196.16s)]
*  You know, or, um, who's the other guy we got from Atlanta? [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5198.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, Nyang. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5202.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5203.759999999999s)]
*  One of those two. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5203.92s)]
*  You know, their salaries are pretty close. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5204.799999999999s)]
*  Uh, I guess Hauser is better though. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5206.96s)]
*  He's a better player. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5209.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5210.12s)]
*  So I'd rather keep Hauser and trade the other guy. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5210.4s)]
*  If there's a market for him. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5213.32s)]
*  I was excited for the other guy because, uh, to hear you try to pronounce [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5215.52s)]
*  his name all year was exciting. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5219.16s)]
*  Where, where did you land on? [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5220.68s)]
*  Well, as you noticed, uh, 20 seconds ago, I didn't pronounce his name. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5222.360000000001s)]
*  Do you, can you, do you want to give it a whirl? [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5227.76s)]
*  No, I'm not, I'm not looking to, uh, George's Nyang. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5229.360000000001s)]
*  What's his first name? [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5233.320000000001s)]
*  I thought it was George's. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5235.16s)]
*  Okay. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5236.4400000000005s)]
*  Or George, well, he's called George, but George Nyang. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5236.76s)]
*  No, our new guy, first name George. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5239.88s)]
*  Uh, I think they'll probably. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5242.8s)]
*  He's a possibility to head out. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5245.360000000001s)]
*  Uh, they don't need much to get under the second aprons. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5247.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5251.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm not worried about it. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5251.68s)]
*  They also, they don't have to do it until February. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5252.72s)]
*  So even if they're a little bit over heading in there, they could still. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5255.400000000001s)]
*  It's going to be a weird team. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5259.76s)]
*  I mean, you and I had the same concerns about holiday and the playoffs last year. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5261.08s)]
*  I, he lost a step. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5266.88s)]
*  There's no doubt about it. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5268.76s)]
*  He couldn't stop. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5270.84s)]
*  Uh, maybe nobody could stop Brunson, but he certainly was not able to stay in front of him. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5271.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5278.04s)]
*  I don't understand Tillman. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5279.8s)]
*  I don't know why he's still on the team. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5282.0s)]
*  He brought nothing at all. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5284.52s)]
*  I understand we have no centers, but, uh, I'd be looking to bring somebody else in here. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5286.2s)]
*  And I think that's how they get under the tax. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5292.56s)]
*  If you trade Tillman, you attach a second round pick to it and somebody just takes the [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5294.4800000000005s)]
*  last year because it's a veteran minimum deal, basically. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5298.68s)]
*  I just read an article about us having interest in, in a little, little, uh, Damien Lillard. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5301.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5307.64s)]
*  I, I mean, his whole salary is being paid for the next two years, right? [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5309.44s)]
*  Yes. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5315.2s)]
*  Can you see him on our team next year when hopefully Tatum and Jellyn Brown, I help [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5316.04s)]
*  him. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5321.76s)]
*  He wouldn't help with the defense. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5322.28s)]
*  I'll tell you that much. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5323.5199999999995s)]
*  Um, it would be kind of like when we had Dana Barros 30 years ago, just somebody [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5324.92s)]
*  coming in and shooting some threes. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5329.24s)]
*  I, to me, it's, I think he's going to be in LA or Portland. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5331.599999999999s)]
*  I don't think we have actual interest in him. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5334.679999999999s)]
*  The big thing we talked, Rob Mahoney and I talked about, uh, if Detroit had made a [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5336.5199999999995s)]
*  run at Jellyn, would the Celtics have considered it? [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5342.679999999999s)]
*  Were the Celtics considering J? [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5346.32s)]
*  They're not going to say anything. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5347.92s)]
*  Nothing leaks out of the Boston things, but, um, were they considering this would be [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5348.8s)]
*  the year to make the Jellyn trade if you were going to do it? [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5355.16s)]
*  Well, but you and I talked about it before Tatum's injury. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5357.84s)]
*  Um, if, if we had gotten bounced out by the Knicks with, which was so, would it [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5362.84s)]
*  been possible even if he wasn't helping Tatum, would Brown have been the one [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5369.080000000001s)]
*  they moved on from? [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5373.88s)]
*  And, uh, after him, after watching awful games from him in the playoffs. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5375.360000000001s)]
*  Well, he was hurt though. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5383.8s)]
*  It came out after the fact that he had a torn meniscus. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5384.72s)]
*  So I don't think, I really don't think he was healthy. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5387.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5390.84s)]
*  I understand that. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5391.320000000001s)]
*  Um, you know, what's funny about you and Jalen Brown, you've just been watching [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5392.8s)]
*  him for nine years, the thought of an offense revolving around him is going to [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5396.52s)]
*  be hard for you in your late seventies. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5402.280000000001s)]
*  Well, I've had these guys over the years that have driven me crazy. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5404.240000000001s)]
*  Tony Allen drove me crazy. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5407.76s)]
*  Marcus Mark drove me crazy. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5409.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5411.84s)]
*  Jalen Brown, he can't dribble. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5412.72s)]
*  He can't make three fours. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5414.200000000001s)]
*  He's, he's a turnover machine. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5415.4400000000005s)]
*  He's a black hole and sometimes he's great. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5417.84s)]
*  I don't know what to make of it. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5420.8s)]
*  I remember Rick Roby was another one way back when that drove you crazy. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5423.84s)]
*  Rick Roby would come in and just miss two footers and then we traded [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5427.84s)]
*  him for Dennis Johnson. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5432.120000000001s)]
*  Well, when you've been in a season to go with what? [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5433.360000000001s)]
*  52 years. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5436.400000000001s)]
*  I have a list. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5437.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5438.72s)]
*  Uh, I don't want to go through the list. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5439.32s)]
*  I kind of went through it a little bit right there. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5441.72s)]
*  One of your, one of your favorite guys to complain about was Todd day. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5444.96s)]
*  I remember that. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5449.16s)]
*  What was it? [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5449.76s)]
*  One Todd day season? [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5450.16s)]
*  Well, Todd day, we were terrible though. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5451.84s)]
*  Sydney Wicks, Curtis Rowe. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5454.64s)]
*  I mean, yeah, those are bad ones, but some of those guys are bad because [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5456.5599999999995s)]
*  lack of effort, others are bad just because they make so many mistakes. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5460.44s)]
*  Uh, [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5466.28s)]
*  well, Jalen's a weird one because he really is one of the best 20 players in [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5467.08s)]
*  the league, but if you catch him in the wrong night or the wrong quarter, he [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5470.2s)]
*  becomes the most frustrating guy you know, you could possibly have. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5472.92s)]
*  And then all of a sudden he's awesome again. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5476.68s)]
*  And I like him as an individual. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5478.4800000000005s)]
*  I think he's extremely bright. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5480.72s)]
*  I like what he has to say. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5482.32s)]
*  It's just some nights he doesn't have it and it's tough to sit there. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5484.04s)]
*  I hope they keep them. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5489.4400000000005s)]
*  I I'm on the record. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5490.4400000000005s)]
*  I would love Tatum and Brown, especially now that they're able to get out of this [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5491.92s)]
*  luxury tax hell for a year. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5496.12s)]
*  There is one more thing I would like to bring up that, okay, we have [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5499.24s)]
*  this non-contending team, maybe we're going to be fifth to sixth seed, maybe [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5504.32s)]
*  fourth, I don't know. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5510.0s)]
*  No, we won't be in the top four. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5511.32s)]
*  Okay. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5513.16s)]
*  We have a coach who's going to have to coach this year. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5515.36s)]
*  Um, you know, uh, I think we won the championship based on some [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5518.8s)]
*  extremely great players and, uh, and, and he did fine. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5525.72s)]
*  Uh, this year, the New York series was a disaster coaching wise and next year. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5533.280000000001s)]
*  Maybe we'll really see great coaching with a team that overachieves. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5541.04s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5547.76s)]
*  It sounds like you've demoted into the second row again. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5549.280000000001s)]
*  No, I'm not yet. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5551.88s)]
*  Not yet. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5553.68s)]
*  Oh, you kept the seat open for him. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5555.04s)]
*  Well, we talked a lot about the, those first two Knicks games since they happen, [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5558.8s)]
*  which is when they lost the Knicks series. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5563.5199999999995s)]
*  And especially after watching the Indiana Knicks series, when Indiana is just [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5565.44s)]
*  pushing the pace, pushing the pace, trying to use talents and Brunson against [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5570.04s)]
*  the Knicks, which worked. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5574.32s)]
*  And then we were going back to us walking the ball up and shooting threes with four [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5575.92s)]
*  seconds left in the shot clock, which was like, it was a godsend for the Knicks [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5581.48s)]
*  taking 34 threes in the second half of game one. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5586.2s)]
*  And it's like, literally the one thing the Knicks needed us to do. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5588.839999999999s)]
*  We did. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5592.12s)]
*  And you were like, well, we have a coach. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5593.12s)]
*  Where was he? [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5594.96s)]
*  Yeah, I was in, you have 20 point leads and both of those games and you keep [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5596.4s)]
*  walking the ball up and shooting threes and no timeouts and the players don't [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5602.4s)]
*  change their pace. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5607.2s)]
*  And there was a lack of strategy and yeah, did that upset me? [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5609.120000000001s)]
*  Of course it did. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5613.92s)]
*  I'm not the only one. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5614.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5616.360000000001s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5618.160000000001s)]
*  Uh, it's going to take a pretty good coaching job this year to get us into [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5619.0s)]
*  the fifth seed, don't you think? [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5624.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5627.240000000001s)]
*  I don't see any way they're a top five seed because I think Detroit's probably [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5627.52s)]
*  above them too. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5631.64s)]
*  And then you move into that Toronto Miami kind of group. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5633.160000000001s)]
*  But we can't be, we can't be finished with our moves. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5636.4s)]
*  We have no center. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5639.72s)]
*  Well, so we have Kada and we have Luke Garza who I think you're going to like. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5641.64s)]
*  You know, Luke Garza, uh, I liked him in college. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5647.28s)]
*  I remember you and I, before that draft talking about him, cause he was a [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5650.4s)]
*  college play of the year. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5653.76s)]
*  And you know, he's the typical, uh, college center did very well. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5655.0s)]
*  And then he gets to the pros and he has no three point shot. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5661.88s)]
*  He's not buried on Minnesota. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5666.0s)]
*  They had no, yeah. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5667.68s)]
*  He didn't get to play. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5668.68s)]
*  Well, he's not quite tall enough either. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5669.84s)]
*  He's not seven feet tall. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5671.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5673.36s)]
*  Um, but the group that we have now. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5674.04s)]
*  Cannot sustain a whole season. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5679.92s)]
*  I don't know what, how, what move they make. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5682.4s)]
*  Maybe there's no move. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5685.68s)]
*  Maybe this is it. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5686.639999999999s)]
*  Uh, I don't think the only thing I could see them doing is, uh, assignments [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5688.28s)]
*  trade for somebody who's cheaper. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5693.28s)]
*  You know, or it's just something where they shaved four or five million bucks [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5696.12s)]
*  off and Simon has an assignment, as an expiring, something like that. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5700.68s)]
*  I don't see anything else. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5705.48s)]
*  Other than sticking somebody with Tillman and giving them a [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5707.8s)]
*  pick to take the contract off. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5710.36s)]
*  But I'm talking about a center. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5712.16s)]
*  I mean, I know Clint Capella. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5713.76s)]
*  There are no centers. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5715.96s)]
*  They're the Lakers can't find a center much less us. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5717.08s)]
*  You wouldn't do D if we signed Deandre eight and I think you would. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5720.28s)]
*  That would be assisted living time. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5724.04s)]
*  You drive you right in there. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5725.839999999999s)]
*  You wouldn't be able to handle it. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5727.32s)]
*  Talk about like no effort guys. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5728.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5730.919999999999s)]
*  Portland paid him to go away. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5731.44s)]
*  No, he's not on my list, but, um, workload pens. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5733.5199999999995s)]
*  I would have taken a flyer on it. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5738.5199999999995s)]
*  It gives a hundred percent. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5740.12s)]
*  Yeah, but that was two for 18. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5742.0s)]
*  We didn't have that. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5743.44s)]
*  We would have had it if we traded houses or trade, you know, we, we, you [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5745.08s)]
*  could have manipulated it to bring in a center like that for a two year period. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5750.36s)]
*  Um, Chris Boucher Larry and the end signs. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5756.24s)]
*  Yeah, there's no centers left. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5760.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5762.719999999999s)]
*  Paselli would have been fun. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5762.88s)]
*  Ironically has as a small ball center, but the next next token, ironically, [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5763.88s)]
*  he would, what did he get? [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5768.84s)]
*  Two for 12. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5771.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5773.44s)]
*  Two for 12. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5773.84s)]
*  We just signed these two Minnesota guys who stink for a total of 11. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5774.719999999999s)]
*  We don't know if they stink yet. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5780.24s)]
*  They weren't getting PT. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5781.28s)]
*  They might be, you're, you don't trust Brad Stevens. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5782.84s)]
*  Don't be surly. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5786.8s)]
*  Well, when you and I talk in January about these two guys in Minnesota, [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5790.24s)]
*  we met, but I had to say, listen, I think you're going to like Josh for not. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5794.56s)]
*  He's like a high energy guy. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5798.96s)]
*  You like, you usually got like guys like this. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5801.8s)]
*  He's like a really tries hard offensive rebounds, flying to the basket guy. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5803.92s)]
*  He's your kind of guy. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5807.64s)]
*  So I don't know if you'll let Garza. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5808.919999999999s)]
*  He's like Hugo. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5810.719999999999s)]
*  He's a high energy guy. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5811.879999999999s)]
*  He, you go, this is rough. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5813.759999999999s)]
*  So we have that with the Red Sox. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5817.679999999999s)]
*  Do you feel better about the Denver straight or no? [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5819.2s)]
*  He isn't really hit for the giants since they made the trade. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5822.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5827.679999999999s)]
*  It's, it's a very strange place to be. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5828.08s)]
*  We have no four, number four hitter Anthony's starting to hit a little bit. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5830.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5834.919999999999s)]
*  I never wanted Douglas to fail in San Francisco. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5835.28s)]
*  I just, I just don't understand how it all fell apart like it did. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5840.92s)]
*  And he was our best hitter. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5846.24s)]
*  So we lost five straight games and I think we scored like five runs or something. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5847.96s)]
*  I don't wish him ill, but I wish we had gotten more in trade. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5856.4s)]
*  I wish we had gotten a hitter back. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5863.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5865.12s)]
*  You know, uh, and they had, what's the mood of the, of the city with the Red Sox these days? [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5865.839999999999s)]
*  Oh, I think nobody, I think they're, uh, if you want to have a nice night out, you [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5871.32s)]
*  know, hot dog, people go to the game, but nobody's expecting them to do anything. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5876.4s)]
*  There's too many, too many teams ahead of them in the playoff race. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5880.5599999999995s)]
*  And people, the owners, that's not, that part's not going great either. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5884.719999999999s)]
*  Well, you know, that's a long, since, since we went in 2018, the owners [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5888.0s)]
*  have kind of, you know, this, we talked about it. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5893.92s)]
*  Their philosophy totally changed. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5896.8s)]
*  They spent a lot of money in Liverpool. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5899.28s)]
*  Uh, the players over there, but it's like, they're very happy. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5901.56s)]
*  We have the highest ticket prices in baseball, major league baseball [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5906.4800000000005s)]
*  for a product that's sub par and they're relying so much on the youngsters. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5911.04s)]
*  But we don't have a power hitter coming up. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5917.24s)]
*  And a lot of these Anthony's not a power hitter. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5920.04s)]
*  Meyer's not a power hitter. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5922.96s)]
*  Uh, I like, Meyer's really good. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5925.04s)]
*  I've actually enjoyed watching them, even though every five days Bueller comes in [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5927.8s)]
*  and gives up like eight, I mean, he's one of the worst pictures we've ever had. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5933.6s)]
*  Like to the point you feel bad for him. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5938.48s)]
*  Like it's a, it's really rare. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5940.08s)]
*  We're starting pictures where I feel bad for the guy I'm watching. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5941.4s)]
*  Well, I read two articles on him this week and it's interesting. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5944.84s)]
*  The article in the globe today was about him and, uh, core is keeping him in [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5948.599999999999s)]
*  rotation and the other article I read was he, they're hoping he's a [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5953.0s)]
*  trade ship at the deadline. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5957.88s)]
*  I think they're keeping him in, in the rotation. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5960.08s)]
*  If he has one good start, they trade him right away. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5962.96s)]
*  You know, so they're going to assume that the team they're training him [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5967.5599999999995s)]
*  to didn't see his last 10 starts. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5970.2s)]
*  Well, maybe, uh, he's. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5972.44s)]
*  It's well, G Alito at the G Alito got shelled like two, three starts ago, [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5975.799999999999s)]
*  but other than that, he's been okay. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5981.48s)]
*  The last seven, eight starts. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5983.0s)]
*  No, he's been okay. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5984.879999999999s)]
*  They've really had disappointments with Bill and, uh, obviously how, uh, is [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5986.16s)]
*  not even back yet and getting lit up in the minor leagues. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5993.08s)]
*  You know, he made the all star team last year and everything fell apart. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=5996.4s)]
*  It's hard to understand that one. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6001.0s)]
*  I mean, tough time for the Red Sox and then the Bruins, the trade [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6002.88s)]
*  Marsha and he goes and wins the cup with Florida and then re-signs with them. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6007.44s)]
*  But they got the BC kid. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6011.96s)]
*  You were excited about that. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6013.2s)]
*  This year I was excited about it. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6015.28s)]
*  The kid they took last year and they passed on it. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6017.24s)]
*  They took the kid that's about 12 feet tall, which is a real fuck and had the [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6019.88s)]
*  terrible freshman year at BC. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6024.759999999999s)]
*  They passed on some pretty good players in that trip. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6026.5599999999995s)]
*  This one, they lucked out. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6029.08s)]
*  They really did. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6030.36s)]
*  Um, I would want to shock that Marsha who's 38 years old, got a six year contract. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6031.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, I think they do it so that it allows them to, yeah, you're basically [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6038.12s)]
*  the first three years and then. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6042.12s)]
*  So it's, it's front loaded or no, I just think he's probably playing two, three [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6044.28s)]
*  more years, but you pay him for six. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6048.8s)]
*  And then if he retires, you get, it seems like there's some short-term cap benefits. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6050.72s)]
*  That was the, I'm glad for him. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6055.8s)]
*  Hey, he earned it. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6057.56s)]
*  He earned it. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6058.56s)]
*  It's, it's so hard though. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6059.8s)]
*  He was our captain. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6061.84s)]
*  He was the guy saluting everybody after the game as they went to the gate. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6063.28s)]
*  It's hard to see that he left. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6069.68s)]
*  So the team that's the most encouraging right now out of the four [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6072.8s)]
*  is probably the paths. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6076.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6077.28s)]
*  Because they haven't started yet and we have, we have high hopes. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6080.36s)]
*  Don't we? [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6085.28s)]
*  I do. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6086.2s)]
*  And yeah, I was, when I was, uh, able to make bets in Indiana on Fandel, [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6087.64s)]
*  I've made a bunch of paths bets. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6092.52s)]
*  I bet I'm variable for coach of the year. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6094.52s)]
*  I bet on the over nine and a half wins. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6096.6s)]
*  I bet on the, the, when the division I'm all in on this team. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6098.52s)]
*  Well, the other thing is we talked about it last year with Washington. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6101.84s)]
*  You know, they got Daniel's at a poor year, so they got one of the easiest [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6105.52s)]
*  schedules, therefore we have one of the easiest schedules this year. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6110.04s)]
*  We should, we should have a chance at 10 wins and then you make the playoffs. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6114.5199999999995s)]
*  New coach, easy schedule. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6119.96s)]
*  We have the QB. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6121.72s)]
*  They did some good free agent signings. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6123.2s)]
*  Not just a new coach, but actually a coach, a coach who knows how to coach. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6125.68s)]
*  Uh, that last year coaching staff was just an abomination. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6131.36s)]
*  Actually two years in a row. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6136.08s)]
*  Three. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6137.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6137.76s)]
*  It's been funny. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6137.96s)]
*  We were saying this as it was happening, but now that they've had the [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6138.64s)]
*  mini camps and stuff. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6141.84s)]
*  And even the players are like, wow, it's nice to have a coaching staff again. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6143.88s)]
*  Like, like these little digs left and right. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6147.08s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6149.84s)]
*  Well, the other thing was last year, a lot of players were speaking to the press, [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6150.92s)]
*  badmouthing the team and the coaching staff. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6156.56s)]
*  Uh, variable is not going to allow that. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6159.76s)]
*  No, I mean, he has a play to do that. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6162.24s)]
*  That play is gone and he has to do that in this league. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6165.24s)]
*  Um, so, [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6169.4400000000005s)]
*  so it sounds like the paths are number one. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6171.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, deep down, are you holding, you holding out hope for the, the [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6175.04s)]
*  Celts kind of hang around and then Tatum comes back in March and. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6179.96s)]
*  It's possible. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6184.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, they already are showing him working out. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6189.32s)]
*  They had a picture in the globe today. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6193.44s)]
*  I saw it in meeting Hugo. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6195.16s)]
*  Uh, he and Hugo setting up a little relationship. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6197.68s)]
*  I'm happy about it. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6200.96s)]
*  What TV shows are you watching now that sports is going to hell? [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6203.32s)]
*  Well, you and I, when I was out in LA last week, we watched, uh, the, uh, [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6207.2s)]
*  Q the Netflix show, uh, John Q. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6213.12s)]
*  No, no, whatever. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6217.24s)]
*  Department Q department Q. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6219.4800000000005s)]
*  That was really, that was really well done. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6221.28s)]
*  Um, well, I haven't watched much. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6224.0s)]
*  We just got back from vacation yesterday. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6227.0s)]
*  As you know, as you know, keep me, keep me posted on your TV. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6229.96s)]
*  You got, you'll go see F1 in the theater. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6233.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm looking forward to, is it in the theater now? [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6236.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6239.84s)]
*  Okay. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6240.48s)]
*  The other one I hadn't seen was ballerina. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6241.12s)]
*  I know it didn't get great reviews, but it's my, my kind of movie. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6243.719999999999s)]
*  John Whip ballerina. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6248.12s)]
*  Weird summer Celtics headed for an eight seed Red Sox season already over. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6249.5599999999995s)]
*  Bruins depressing and somehow the Patriots have become the team of hope again. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6256.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's, it's hard. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6262.4800000000005s)]
*  When you get to the dog days of July and August baseball, you really [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6264.96s)]
*  like to watch baseball, it's tough. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6269.72s)]
*  I guess we're going to watch the work piece. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6272.56s)]
*  And, uh, I think they bring Campbell back up. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6274.4800000000005s)]
*  Somebody told me that. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6278.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, and any of your 53rd year Celtics season tickets, I thought it was really [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6280.4800000000005s)]
*  nice of them to give everybody a 20% discount after they got rid of all the, [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6284.08s)]
*  oh, no, they didn't do that. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6287.68s)]
*  Well, you know, you buy it, you agree to get next season tickets in March. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6291.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6297.76s)]
*  It's a contract. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6297.92s)]
*  Jason Tatum was still playing in March. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6298.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6300.6s)]
*  So I don't blame the Celtics. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6300.84s)]
*  They didn't know what was going to happen, but, uh, [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6302.4s)]
*  maybe throw some, some free drinks for everybody a couple of times. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6306.16s)]
*  We're going to get a discount based on the. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6311.5599999999995s)]
*  There's no way there's going to be some grim nights. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6314.16s)]
*  There's going to be like some Celtics, Washington Celtics, Charlotte, Celtics, [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6318.36s)]
*  Utah games, where the tickets will be about, I mean, we haven't been in a [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6322.599999999999s)]
*  situation like this with the Celtics since probably the year before Marcus. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6327.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6332.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6333.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6333.5599999999995s)]
*  That was like the last, the last bad team they had was over 10 years ago. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6334.08s)]
*  I don't know if this team's going to be bad. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6337.8s)]
*  They still have Jaylen who's still a top 20 guy. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6339.5199999999995s)]
*  They still have white. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6342.0s)]
*  Simon's will be able to score. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6343.36s)]
*  They still have Prichard. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6344.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, they'll, they'll be able to shoot threes. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6346.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm not worried about the bill because I emailed the Celtics last week that I [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6348.76s)]
*  have a new address and I gave your address to send the bill. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fLWXUxvdk&t=6353.44s)]
