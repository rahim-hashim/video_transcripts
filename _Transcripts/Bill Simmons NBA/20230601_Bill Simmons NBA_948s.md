# Will This Celtics Team Ever Get Over the Hump? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW5owo_8EQU)
*  I brought you on to talk about the concept of NBA eras.
*  And then we'll do some finals in the end.
*  But for the people listening, this is not just a Celtic statement.
*  House is my NBA historical conciliary.
*  We've known each other for 35 years.
*  We've talked a lot about when we watch current basketball, how it relates to the
*  basketball we've already watched, the teams we've watched, the players we watched.
*  And the Celtics are at a crossroads house.
*  And it's not just about them.
*  It's about what do you do when your franchise kind of falls into this specific
*  situation? So I went back and I sent you all the research I did.
*  Like how unique is it to be five conference finals in seven years?
*  What's that list or who's close to the list?
*  What are the types of teams?
*  And it's really interesting what the research says.
*  The window is basically three to eight years historically where you have like on
*  the shorter end, you have the Drexler Blazers who made the conference finals
*  three years around 90, 91, 92.
*  They made the finals in 90.
*  They made the finals in 92.
*  And then MJ took their took Drexler's heart and he pulled it out.
*  Indiana Jones, Temple, Doomsday.
*  We just pulled it out.
*  He waved it to the crowd.
*  We never saw them again until the late 90s.
*  They were done.
*  True story.
*  So, so that's the shorter end where it was this team that was just really, really
*  relevant for a short period of time that actually House would, I mean, you could
*  probably do this compare contrasted Drexler Blazers to the, to the Jason
*  Jalen Celtics, some similarities, like incredible talent found a great way to
*  shoot themselves in the foot at the worst time, lost some close games.
*  Lotta coulda woulda shoulda's.
*  But, you know, we always watch those Blazers teams in college and we were like,
*  God damn Blazers stay out of your own way.
*  And they just never could.
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  And I honestly think, um, this is part of, of, of the bias, the old guy bias, but I
*  think that that Blazers team was super talented.
*  Like I really were, I would put them up against the current version of the Celtics
*  and feel pretty good about it.
*  Yeah, I'm with you.
*  It was, as we've always talked about, that's probably the best stretch of talent
*  for the league ever that 90, 91, 92, 93.
*  They beat the Lakers in the series.
*  Right.
*  They, they went toe to toe in that Detroit Pistons, 1990.
*  They lost them five, but it was a really good series.
*  And then, you know, they go, they stumble into MJ in 1992.
*  What can you do?
*  So that's the short end, the longer end.
*  You're talking about teams like, uh, the Julia serving Philadelphia team.
*  And then a team that I never even occurred to me would be a team that would
*  be in the discussion, but is that kind of the clear comparison in the
*  cells is this basically 94 to 2000 Indiana team, which I would call the
*  Reggie Miller Pacers, their early edition.
*  So they made the conference finals in 94, 95, 98, 99 and 2000.
*  They made the finals in 2000.
*  They had a little bit of a reboot in 96 and 97 where they lost first round,
*  no playoffs in 97, and then they kind of, they kind of kicked it back.
*  They had three game seven Eastern conference finals losses.
*  And then a really tough 2000 finals loss that I think you and I both feel like
*  that series has been kind of lost in history a lot closer and a lot more
*  competitive than I think people remember now.
*  This is like Jalen, I, this is one of the first things we bonded on.
*  It's like, God damn, you guys were like a couple of plays away from winning
*  the title that year, like nobody mentions that, but, but look at that though.
*  Set.
*  It's a seven year run, five conference finals, one finals, very similar to
*  the Celtics, right?
*  Yes.
*  Totally.
*  Totally agree.
*  Again, a pretty deep team.
*  I mean, they, they, they really had talent, front court talent, back court talent.
*  Reggie was the clear leader.
*  Um, but you know,
*  they're physical.
*  They had the Davis brothers.
*  They had, they was like, yeah, there's like Chris Mullen was there for a little
*  bit.
*  They had Mark Jackson.
*  Yeah.
*  Then they had the young guys with Jalen and best.
*  So the reason they're interesting to me is in 99, they were, they were thinking
*  long-term big picture as they're competing and they traded Antonio Davis for
*  the number five pick who turned out to be Jonathan Bender, who turned out to be a
*  bust.
*  I think he might've gotten hurt, but he was like one of those seven foot small
*  forward guys.
*  Those guys I'm out on almost instantly.
*  Yeah.
*  Not ready.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, and then the next year they traded Dale Davis for Germaine O'Neal to Portland.
*  So they, they were always like competing, but thinking ahead.
*  Um, but when I look at them, that's a good example for how do you extend your
*  window while still competing?
*  And we've seen all these teams like just going through, like we'll go back to
*  Philly in a second, cause that's the most interesting one, but the Milwaukee
*  Bucks, the Don Nelson era, eight years, they were competitive, three conference
*  finals, they lost three game sevens in round two.
*  They were in the same conference with Philly and Boston.
*  They did some stuff we'll talk about in a second.
*  Uh, Phoenix had the KJ Barkley era.
*  That was seven years.
*  They made three conference finals in the finals once they lost two game
*  sevens in round two or three, actually.
*  Um, Oh two.
*  And then, uh, Utah was the other one where they just kept it together for 10 years.
*  They made the conference finals in 92, 94, 96, 97, 98 made the finals twice.
*  Made three round twos.
*  They went the other way.
*  They're more similar to the Celtics where they really only made one big trade,
*  which was Jeff Malone and a first for Jeff Hornacek.
*  Why all of this is relevant is the Celtics have to look at this and go, all right,
*  we keep these guys together and we're going to get over the hump.
*  But the entire NBA history says teams like this don't get over the hump.
*  They actually go the other way that the one exception was the Philadelphia 76ers
*  who made the conference finals in 77, 78, 80, 81, 82, 83, 85, eight times or seven
*  times in nine years to make the finals in 77, 80 and 82, but it wasn't till they
*  made the Bozeman's Malone trade that they got over the hump.
*  That they got over the hump.
*  My question for you house, is it a Moses Malone type trade?
*  That would say the Celtics.
*  Do you have to kind of do what Indiana did a better version of it where you try
*  to do your John Bender, Jermaine O'Neal while staying competitive, but thinking
*  like almost like a second era opening up.
*  You got Tatum was only 25.
*  You got a lot of time left.
*  They're a younger team.
*  The other downside team that would be possible would be the OKC team, which
*  four conference finals, 11, 12, 14 and 16 made the finals in 2012.
*  And they didn't do a lot, which I want to dive into, but all of a sudden it was over.
*  Right.
*  Katie leaves and done.
*  And the Celtics are at a crossroads here because if they do the Jaylen Brown and
*  they trade into Houston for number four and all these picks and be like, we're
*  going to stay competitive, it might be the OKC thing where it just never happens
*  again, or you try to trade, you know, some of the lesser guys, Keith Brown and Tatum.
*  Do you agree with me that this team is at the crossroads?
*  I do think they are at the crossroads because of the collective bargaining
*  agreement that is staring the entire league right in the face.
*  It is about to be a radically different competitive landscape and the particular
*  challenge that the Celtics have right in front of them right now, which is why it's
*  the crossroads moment is can you afford to pay two players max money and look,
*  these two players, one, two, three, four, five, five conference finals.
*  Do you believe in your heart of hearts that those two guys are capable of
*  actually winning a championship with the right role players?
*  So in this era, the thing that I'll put to you is what's your level of confidence
*  that the guys doing the drafting for Boston and the guys doing the, you know,
*  looking at that, the roster are going to be able to grab some of the Miami mojo
*  and find super inexpensive players who can play meaningful minutes in playoff
*  games and make a meaningful difference in terms of the outcomes of, of playoff
*  games, because that's the way it is.
*  In terms of the outcomes of playoff games, because that's the environment that
*  I think we're about to be operating in.
*  You can afford to all NBA players, but that's it.
*  You must surround them with super cheap guys that are capable of making
*  contributions and the window is not very, you know, it's not a long window.
*  You're going to get maybe like two years, three years max out of these inexpensive
*  guys.
*  I think that's like the, the, the size and scope of the problem that we're
*  looking at right now.
*  Either.
*  Did you agree with that?
*  Yeah.
*  Cause you think two years from now, you got two max guys, basically, if they
*  keep Jalen, you got white making like 18, 17, 18 million a year.
*  You need him.
*  There's three and you probably can get away with one more guy in the 14, 15 range.
*  And then after that, you're just trying to get lucky with the Caleb Martin types.
*  So you're trying to get lucky with your second round pick or your end of the, uh,
*  end of the round, first round or whatever it is.
*  The white trade, if you're just going backwards and you're like, who are the
*  unquestioned keepers, you would say Tatum and you would say Brown, you would say
*  white, and then the rest of the roster is kind of TBD.
*  And I don't like Rob Williams every year gets hurt.
*  There's always like a different story.
*  Even in game seven, it's like Rob Williams was sick.
*  He was running back to throw up.
*  It's like, well, it was a game seven.
*  Is there, do we have a lot of evidence that Rob Williams is going to show up in
*  big games?
*  So you start looking at these people like, all right, am I better off playing
*  Rob Williams 14 million a year, or can I do a stop gap free agent center?
*  And that's the other thing is on the market are going to be all these guys
*  because the, the CBA, the players union is going to destroy the middle class.
*  Basically.
*  You have a lot of guys like basically taking much cheaper money to play for,
*  for good teams, which put, which would be an advantage for the Celtics, right?
*  I'd be an advantage for Denver, a couple others.
*  The bigger question for me and my dad and I talked about a little is just like,
*  did he hit the ceiling with this team?
*  And that's why I went back and did all the research because a lot, in a lot of
*  these cases, the team hit the ceiling, you know, like Philly in 1982, they got
*  their asses kicked by the Lakers.
*  And it was just clear, like this isn't going to work.
*  Dr.
*  J is getting a little older.
*  We have a Caldwell Jones, Darrell Dawkins center combo.
*  We just don't have enough.
*  Like we're always, we're always going to get overpowered down low and we got to
*  do something and the Moses trade stumbled into their lap.
*  They only gave up Caldwell Jones and a 1983 first for the best guy in the league
*  at the time.
*  Milwaukee was in a different point where they lost, you know, they lost in round
*  two and 80 and 81 in game seven.
*  They lost the conference finals in 83.
*  In 84, they make a pretty ballsy trade.
*  They traded Marcus Johnson, who was great.
*  It was just an awesome forward with, uh, with Harvey Ketchings, junior
*  Bridgman, and they got back young Terry Cummings, Craig Hodges and Ricky Pierce.
*  And they rebooted and they were able to go conference finals, 85 and 86.
*  They lost a heartbreaker to the Celtics in 87 and round two in seven.
*  But, and they traded for a Jack Sickman, 82.
*  But, and they traded for a Jack Sickman 86, but they were on the fly going,
*  we've hit our ceiling.
*  We got to make a move.
*  And when they traded for Terry Cummings, I think all of us were like, holy shit.
*  They got Terry Cummings.
*  That guy's awesome.
*  So he'd only been in the league for like a year.
*  Um, then you look at a team like Phoenix.
*  So they have the, before they got Barkley, they made the conference
*  finals in 89 and 1990.
*  And in December, 1990, they, they made their move and unfortunately it was a
*  terrible move.
*  They traded our guy, Eddie Johnson, our dude for who is now, uh, now known as
*  Justin Termini sidekick.
*  That's, that's how he's officially introduced to restaurants.
*  I'm kidding Eddie.
*  Um, they trade Eddie Johnson in two first rounders for Xavier McDaniel.
*  And McDaniel comes to Phoenix and he bombs.
*  Like you go look at his playoff stats.
*  He averaged like nine points a game in the playoffs.
*  They suck.
*  It ruins their 91 thing, kind of ruins 92 too.
*  And then that leads to the Barkley trade.
*  Um, so sometimes house, when you make the, the kind of big move, it can go sideways.
*  You can end up with the Xavier McDaniel thing.
*  Portland set up the Drexler.
*  They traded Sam Bowie and Mookie Blaylock who is a, going to be a rookie for Buck
*  Williams and that kind of ignited them.
*  Then they traded a first for Danny Ainge, but then they started fucking up.
*  They traded Drozd and Petrovich for Walter Davis.
*  It was on his way down out.
*  They gave away Robert pack for a second rounder and they kind of fucked that up.
*  Um, the more recent examples, I really have trouble putting Phoenix in here.
*  Phoenix is another one like this where they had a specific six year run conference
*  finals, 05, 06, 2010, two brutal spurs losses in round two and in 2007 and round
*  one in 2008 where those were really the Western finals for the most part.
*  Um, or is it the Lakers in no way, obviously, but, um, but for the most part,
*  all their moves were to save money.
*  So I don't even know what we can learn from them other than that.
*  Don't have Robert Sarver on your team.
*  Okay.
*  C is a good one because they make the four conference finals and the one finals.
*  They didn't really do a lot to improve that team.
*  Like if you're talking about Presti is one of the great GMs, which I think he is.
*  This resume of moves here where they traded Jeff Green and a first for Perkins in 2011.
*  They did a lot of like around the fringes.
*  Then they trade James Harden for Kevin Martin, Lam and Adams.
*  Basically in 2015, they traded first for Dion waiters.
*  And then in 2015, they also traded Perkins and Reggie Jackson in 2018.
*  First for Enos Cantor and Steve Novak pretty rough.
*  So they couldn't kind of figure out how to patch together.
*  And yet they almost won in 2016.
*  They're up three, one clay has the heroic game six.
*  And I think that was, that was KD going.
*  We've hit the wall.
*  I can't win here.
*  And I wonder with the Celtics, if they're looking at what's happened to them,
*  do they see a wall or do they see bad luck?
*  Do they see Curry in game four last year leaving his body in the second half and just fucking
*  single-handedly switching the series?
*  Do they see Miami where they just kind of fuck up the first couple of games and then it's just too hard to beat them four times in a row.
*  Can you excuse what happened or is it a symptom of something that's missing from this team?
*  So it seems to me it's more like, and I think Oklahoma City of all of these teams that we're comparing is like the most apt comparison because those guys were young.
*  Because they were younger.
*  Yes, exactly right.
*  So you have that added element of uncertainty about, you know, sort of team building.
*  You know what you have in KD and Westbrook and we thought they knew what they had with James Harden, but apparently they didn't know what they had.
*  We knew what they had.
*  We knew.
*  At least we knew.
*  We knew he was going to be an awesome six man for them.
*  We didn't know he was going to be an MVP.
*  But you know, I think there is something in between bad luck and hitting a wall and I think that in between space is what Boston occupies right now.
