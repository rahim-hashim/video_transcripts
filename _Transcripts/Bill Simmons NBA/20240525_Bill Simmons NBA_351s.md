# Do the 76ers Need a Third Star? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXXhqPGsag8)
*  And so as we start talking about like, oh, this guy might be available and Donovan Mitchell might
*  be available and Paul George and everything. Yeah. I wonder whether or not like there will be any
*  trickle down effect from the success of certain teams in the playoffs this year
*  of people being like, I think actually what we would like to do is go seven deep with guys who
*  know their role around their two stars. And the happiest I was as a Sixers fan this year is when
*  I felt like there was that kind of balance on the team before Embiid got hurt.
*  Where it was like Maxi and Embiid were the clear one and two.
*  I thought you already got your one free swing.
*  He said when Embiid got hurt, I was just, I just wanted more clarification.
*  I'm talking about the changing paradigm of NBA team building. You know, you've got to make it regional.
*  Anyway, I was just, I was just wondering out loud like, oh, I wonder whether or not anybody's
*  going to look at Dallas and be like, huh, like, where's my Gafford rather than, okay, let's bring
*  in another guy and another guy who are going to, you know, and we're going to have to find the
*  chemistry and find all this. Wouldn't you say it's different if you have Luca or you have
*  Wemba Nyama or if you have Jokic, you really only need one other major guy and then some awesome
*  role players, I would say. Because it's like the major guys almost were two guys, right, Rob?
*  You do need to be sure that whoever your best player is, and I think Joel Embiid is clearly
*  one of these guys, is a truly, truly elite player, like an immutable force in a potential series.
*  Of course, their efficiency is going to go up and down, but they change the matchups by being on the
*  floor. And so they have to be really good. Obviously, when your second guy is a shot creator like Kyrie,
*  that changes a lot. But what you do below them, I think it can get tricky and almost we want to
*  have it both ways sometimes where these teams that do the three star model, yeah, you get burned
*  if you have Bradley Beal as your third star. That's clearly not good enough to support a bunch of
*  minimum contracts filling out the rest of the roster. I think Paul George is significantly
*  better than that. If you're talking about a third or however you want to classify the pecking order
*  of what would be in Philadelphia. And at the same time, the other outlets, the other avenues for
*  building teams have their pitfalls too. If you may think you're seven deep, but then you get in
*  the playoffs and you're only actually five deep and all of your best laid plans go to shit because
*  two role players couldn't quite be as good as you thought they were. So Michael Malone didn't get
*  the email about playing like the young kids in the playoffs. Yeah. Right. So yeah, those things are
*  all like, I think there's so many ways for NBA teams to go wrong and we always want to diagnose
*  them and you want to give yourself as many outs as you can. But realistically, if you can get three
*  star level players, I still think that's a really good model. If I'm Paul George, I could just stay
*  in LA, make a ton of money. I'm from LA. You know, I wouldn't say there's a shit load of pressure on
*  the Clipper players out here, right? Nice weather every day and I have an awesome house. Or I could
*  move to Philadelphia with one of the most psychotic fan bases that exists. Keep going. The moment
*  anything goes wrong, it's my fucking fault. I'm the new Tobias Harris. That's called pressure
*  makes breaks. I'm living in Philadelphia, which I'm pretty sure there's no ocean like just to have
*  a nice two hours away. And the only reason I believe the Clippers is it's like, I'm tired of
*  this Kawhi roller coaster, not knowing if does this guy's going to play. I'm going to sign up
*  for Joel Embiid because that's going to be a much more stable game, game after game, month after month
*  relation. I think Joel Embiid's relationship to the Sixers and the Sixers fans is much
*  different than Kawhi Leonard's relationship to the Clipper players. I'm talking about him being on the court.
*  Yes. CR. Yeah. Yeah. So if I'm leaving Kawhi, I want to go to a team where I know... I wish Embiid
*  maybe had a little bit more Kawhi. I wish he took more nights off and was more like, hey, the knee's
*  a little gamey. I'm going to let it rest. That's fair. Well, let me ask you this after these playoffs.
*  Who is that star that your positive will be on the court?
*  Because everybody else is dropping like flies. But this is going back to my dating ground point.
*  Those guys fucking play. Nobody mentions that as like a strength. Yeah. Super durable. Knock on wood.
*  Yokage, same thing. Luka, even though he gimps around sometimes, he's still fucking out there
*  every time. Here's the solution for all of us with Paul George. A double sign and trade with the Lakers.
*  Turn the turn the camera on, Kyle. Double sign and trade. LeBron gets to stay in LA,
*  but he goes to the Clippers to open the new stadium, finishes his career there.
*  Paul George gets to finally play with the Lakers after it was blocked by Adam Silver a couple years
*  ago. And finally he gets to be a Laker and he gets to be him and AD and JJ Reddick.
*  And we're off. It's a new era for the Lakers. JJ Reddick, was that conditional that they get
*  rid of LeBron so that there's no conflict of interest with the podcast? No, I'm just saying
*  it's a new post-LeBron era with Paul George, AD. I couldn't possibly start a TV show made by
*  Andy Greenwald. It would complicate our podcasting relationship. No, I just like that. I like the
*  narrative of that. LeBron and the Clippers, Ballmer's like, this is great. I have LeBron James to
*  open my new arena. We'll see if he can get, what is he, what are his things left? 40,000 points?
*  Has he done that yet? LeBron you're talking about? Yeah, he broke the scoring record. Did he get 40,000?
*  Maybe he did. There's got to be some milestone left he can break in the, what's it called,
*  the Intuit Dome? The Inglewood? Yeah, the Intuit Dome.
