# The Curious Career of Joel Embiid | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0)
*  All right, we're still, we're gonna talk Embiid [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=0.0s)]
*  because this is really one of the most unusual careers [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=1.96s)]
*  of any great player and he looks like he's in peril again [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=5.68s)]
*  with this knee injury that he has [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  and I'm not sure if he's gonna make it through the round. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  You don't know if he's gonna make it through each game. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=13.4s)]
*  He's, in the playoffs, he's played 56 of 64 games. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=15.84s)]
*  They're 29 and 27 when he plays in the playoffs. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=20.52s)]
*  He averages 24 and 11. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=23.64s)]
*  He shoots 46%, 28% from three. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=25.28s)]
*  21.8 PR, 9.3 free throws attempts a game, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=28.44s)]
*  34.7 minutes a game, 1.7 blocks a game. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=32.0s)]
*  The stats don't look like what his regular season stats [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=35.96s)]
*  look like for the most part. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=39.32s)]
*  He has five round one wins in his career. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=41.36s)]
*  2018 Miami round one. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=46.28s)]
*  Can you name the best part on that team? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=49.24s)]
*  In 2018? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=53.38s)]
*  2018 Miami. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=55.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=58.440000000000005s)]
*  Born Dragich. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=59.72s)]
*  That was the one Justice Winslow year where they're like, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=61.88s)]
*  we think we figured him out. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=63.96s)]
*  Justice Winslow had the highest approval rating [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=67.16s)]
*  for the lowest PER maybe. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I was in on him. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  They beat 2019 Brooklyn. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=73.36s)]
*  That was the Laverte D'Lo, Jared Allen, Dinwiddie team. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=75.88s)]
*  They beat 2021 Washington, Westbrook Beale. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=79.44s)]
*  They beat 2022 Toronto that won 48 games, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=82.8s)]
*  Ciacom Van Vliet, Rookie Scotty Barnes OG. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=85.76s)]
*  So that was probably the best of the wins. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=89.56s)]
*  And then last year beat the Brooklyn team post KD Trade [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=92.72000000000001s)]
*  that didn't have anybody. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=95.56s)]
*  So five round one wins and then six playoff series losses [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=97.0s)]
*  that we can go through and I think we're headed [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=102.76s)]
*  for a seventh one here. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  I don't know how much of this is just horrible luck [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=106.76s)]
*  and it might be all of it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=110.0s)]
*  But I do know that I haven't quite seen a career [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  like this for Cello and I don't even really know [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=114.52000000000001s)]
*  how to put it in perspective. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=118.0s)]
*  And this was one of our big assignments for the podcast. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=119.76s)]
*  Where did you land? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=123.44000000000001s)]
*  What did you come up with? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=124.28s)]
*  Who is he like? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=128.24s)]
*  No, just where we are with him. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=130.08s)]
*  He's 30 years old. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=132.16s)]
*  I don't know if this gets better from a health standpoint [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=134.56s)]
*  because we've seen with great players [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=136.92000000000002s)]
*  that injuries start adding up. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  What is the light at the end of the tunnel here [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=140.0s)]
*  if you're like, hey, this guy's still gonna win [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=141.72s)]
*  a title someday? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=143.96s)]
*  I just, I don't know how you can bet on it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=148.84s)]
*  And it's not really even about him, the player. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=151.16s)]
*  The playoff drop off for the efficiency stuff [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=154.16s)]
*  is significant. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=156.72s)]
*  And I know you've run through it here, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=157.88s)]
*  but when I was looking at it this morning, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=159.72s)]
*  I'm like, man, it's even worse than I thought it was. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=161.16s)]
*  You start digging through the game logs. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=163.2s)]
*  You're like, there's just a lot of bad games in there. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=164.76s)]
*  And then you're like, I'm not gonna do this. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=166.84s)]
*  There's just a lot of bad games in there. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=168.56s)]
*  And we don't treat him like some of the other players [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=170.16s)]
*  that are in the MVP conversation for having bad games. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=175.2s)]
*  Cause I think he's had, you know, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=178.4s)]
*  he had the Ben Simmons Atlanta series and he's been hurt. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=180.44s)]
*  You know, it's one thing if he's healthy [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=183.36s)]
*  and he's playing like this, but he's been hurt. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=184.56s)]
*  And so many, like every single year there's something. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=186.12s)]
*  And so. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=189.08s)]
*  I have that list by the way for after you're done. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=191.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=193.76s)]
*  I don't know why this all of a sudden gets better post 30. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=194.6s)]
*  And that's why we're doing this segment because [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=199.6s)]
*  when you start putting a bunch of injuries on somebody, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=204.44s)]
*  the trend in the league with the history of it [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=207.44s)]
*  with the good players is that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=210.24s)]
*  the arrow usually starts pointing down after a while. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=211.64s)]
*  And we saw this happen with Blake Griffin, right? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=214.32s)]
*  Where Blake Griffin had a bunch of different injuries [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=219.32s)]
*  and then he started to get hurt. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=221.72s)]
*  And then he had a bunch of different injuries [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=223.16s)]
*  and then all of a sudden Detroit was probably his last stand [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=224.44s)]
*  that won Detroit year. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=227.4s)]
*  And then his body just started breaking down. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=228.24s)]
*  Now he's had some bad luck injuries like 2018. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=231.12s)]
*  They lost to Boston in five and around two, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=234.0s)]
*  orbital fracture, concussion, right? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=236.20000000000002s)]
*  Not his fault. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=238.68s)]
*  Can't blame him on that obviously. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=239.52s)]
*  2019 round two lost to Toronto in seven, knee tendonitis. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=241.36s)]
*  And he was bad in that series like for him. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=245.52s)]
*  And he had a left knee issue that year [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=248.24s)]
*  where he missed 14 games after the All-Star break. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=250.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=252.51999999999998s)]
*  2020 round one, they got swept by Boston, no injury. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=253.44s)]
*  2021 round two lost to Atlanta in seven [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=256.96s)]
*  and a torn meniscus. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=259.28s)]
*  2022 round two lost to Miami in six. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=260.96s)]
*  He had a torn thumb ligament from earlier in the playoffs [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  then had another orbital fracture, concussion. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=266.12s)]
*  This guy had that twice, which is horrible. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=269.08s)]
*  2023 last year lost to Boston in seven, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=272.4s)]
*  had a knee sprain that he played with. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=274.92s)]
*  And then this year has the meniscus. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=277.2s)]
*  A lot of injuries including knee tendonitis, torn meniscus, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=280.44s)]
*  torn meniscus again and then knee sprain. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=284.64s)]
*  And not to mention all the stuff that he had early. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=287.32s)]
*  But the reason it's so fascinating is, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  I did my pyramid and I have all the best centers ever, right? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=292.76s)]
*  And just in descending order, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=295.44s)]
*  the top level, Russell, Kareem, Wilt, Shaq, Kakeem, Moses, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=298.12s)]
*  all of those guys by the time they were in Embiid's age, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=301.71999999999997s)]
*  they did the better than finals or won a title. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=304.28s)]
*  The next level, Jokic, he won a title. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=307.44s)]
*  The next level, Walton, won a title early. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=310.08s)]
*  David Robinson, conference finals a bunch of times. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=312.8s)]
*  At least twice, right? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=316.8s)]
*  With San Antonio, maybe once. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=318.12s)]
*  Maybe, I think twice. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=320.44s)]
*  Willis Reed won a title. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=321.59999999999997s)]
*  Dave Cowans won a title. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=322.96s)]
*  Patrick Ewing got to the finals, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=324.76s)]
*  was always in the mix there. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=326.88s)]
*  George Mikan was a million years ago. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=328.84s)]
*  And then even you go down to level two guys, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=330.76s)]
*  Wes Unsullett made the finals in his third year. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=332.68s)]
*  Nate Thurman, he was in the finals. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=336.52s)]
*  Dwight Howard, he made the finals 2009. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=338.12s)]
*  And Bob McAdoo did not make the finals [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=341.32s)]
*  until he was a roll guy with the Lakers. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=344.44s)]
*  But I just listed six, seven, 10, 13, 17 centers [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=345.92s)]
*  that are probably the 17 best centers [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=351.76s)]
*  in the history of the league, right? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=353.8s)]
*  And Embiid's had less success [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=355.2s)]
*  than everybody except McAdoo at this point. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=356.68s)]
*  So it's not like nothing's happening here. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=359.88s)]
*  And yet it's weird [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=362.8s)]
*  because I don't know how much you can stick them with. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=364.04s)]
*  It really seems like most of this is just bad luck. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=368.79999999999995s)]
*  I definitely think it's on the bad luck side [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=373.12s)]
*  more than it is anything else. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=374.64s)]
*  But I've said this for a long time now, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=375.91999999999996s)]
*  watching how some of these tighter [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=378.12s)]
*  playoff games have closed out. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=379.84s)]
*  This is why this position that we've evolved [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=381.71999999999997s)]
*  from this traditional center position, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=384.79999999999995s)]
*  even though he's not a traditional center [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=386.56s)]
*  with his touch and his shooting ability [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=388.32s)]
*  and the way you gotta get him shot. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=390.03999999999996s)]
*  But I think the most valuable guys [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=391.76s)]
*  are the guys that can have the ball in their hands [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=393.88s)]
*  and figure out how to set up their own offense [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=395.68s)]
*  or offense for everybody else like Jokic. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=398.64s)]
*  And those are the most valuable guys. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=400.88s)]
*  But you could say Embiid was like that [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=402.76s)]
*  in the first part of the regular season, right? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=404.47999999999996s)]
*  I mean, he was scoring 35 a game. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=406.84s)]
*  You could say, well, they should maybe translate. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=409.12s)]
*  He was on track for a 35 PER, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=412.0s)]
*  but I don't know that he would have held that up. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=414.0s)]
*  I mean, it would have been the highest of all time. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=415.68s)]
*  I don't know that that was gonna happen [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=417.28s)]
*  if he played 65 games. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=418.4s)]
*  He's never played 70 games in a season. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=420.64s)]
*  But I think there's a slight limitation for him offensively [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=422.92s)]
*  in comparison to the other. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=428.6s)]
*  And I'm not just talking about scoring numbers [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=430.76s)]
*  and his averages and his shooting and all that stuff. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=432.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm just talking about like he needs to be set up [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=434.36s)]
*  just a little bit more than the other four or five [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=437.92s)]
*  best players that we think about in the league. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=441.12s)]
*  I feel that way, other people would disagree. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=442.96000000000004s)]
*  But this is someone that I've been making mistakes on [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=445.56s)]
*  for a while, you know? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=449.68s)]
*  When I go back to the draft, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=450.52000000000004s)]
*  I liked him better than everybody else. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=451.52000000000004s)]
*  You're like, okay, so wait, he's getting foot surgery? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=453.32s)]
*  Like, all right, well, now what do you do with him? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=455.52000000000004s)]
*  And then he sits out the first two years, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=459.12s)]
*  which you could say was complications with foot surgery, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=460.84000000000003s)]
*  but let's face it, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=463.76s)]
*  Hinky didn't want him playing out there. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=464.6s)]
*  Then he plays 31 games his third year, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=465.72s)]
*  and then he's coming up for a contract. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=467.32s)]
*  And I made a huge mistake with my opinion on it, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=468.68s)]
*  was just, I don't know that I'd wanna give this guy [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=471.96000000000004s)]
*  nine figures all of a sudden. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=474.88s)]
*  And then it turns into, he's got the MVP. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=476.96000000000004s)]
*  Some would argue he should have a second one, I wouldn't, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=480.40000000000003s)]
*  but he gets the one last year, and that's the whole point. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=482.52000000000004s)]
*  So he's actually surpassed what I thought he could be, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=485.24s)]
*  because I go, who has a start of his career that way? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=489.44s)]
*  And then it all just kind of works out. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=492.2s)]
*  Right, you're supposed to be a bust [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=494.36s)]
*  with the way his career started, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=495.8s)]
*  not a potential MVP down the road, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=497.08000000000004s)]
*  who actually wins the MVP. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=499.96000000000004s)]
*  Right, so where are you with him [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=501.68s)]
*  as being the face of your franchise? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=504.96000000000004s)]
*  I just wouldn't trust it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=510.76s)]
*  We've seen enough at this point, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=515.0s)]
*  he's gonna be 31 next season. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=516.32s)]
*  He's a big dude, right? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=520.24s)]
*  You've stood on a court that he's been on the court with. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=522.4s)]
*  He's a big dude that carries a lot of weight, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=526.12s)]
*  and structurally has just had [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=529.08s)]
*  a bunch of things happen to him now. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=531.72s)]
*  Like if I'm a Philly fan, I'm like, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=533.36s)]
*  oh yeah, we got him beat for the next five, six years. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=535.5600000000001s)]
*  Would you feel like you had him [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=537.9200000000001s)]
*  beat for the next five, six years? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=539.16s)]
*  It's almost like you're taking it year by year [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=540.8399999999999s)]
*  because you don't know how his body's gonna respond [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=542.52s)]
*  because each year it's something else. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=545.0799999999999s)]
*  Watching him, there's another debate [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=548.4s)]
*  about whether he should even be playing in this series. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=551.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's why as we're talking this all out, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=555.1999999999999s)]
*  like you can feel incredibly unfair [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=556.92s)]
*  because you're like, hey you guys, he's not healthy, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=558.48s)]
*  like why are you guys doing this now? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=560.12s)]
*  But this is the point. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=561.3199999999999s)]
*  He's 100% not healthy. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=562.16s)]
*  He threw an alley-oop off the backboard to himself, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=563.4s)]
*  came down like he was shot. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=565.64s)]
*  But it's not that different. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=568.28s)]
*  Came back later. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=569.72s)]
*  Like it's the same way I feel about Kawhi, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=570.56s)]
*  where it's like, yeah, he's awesome. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=573.9599999999999s)]
*  But like, you know, okay, is he gonna be there? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=576.8399999999999s)]
*  It's just different. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=581.6s)]
*  It just means there's other guys I'd rather have than him [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=583.1999999999999s)]
*  that aren't as good as him, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=585.72s)]
*  which I think is totally reasonable. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=587.52s)]
*  All right, so let's say Josh Harris called us. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=589.36s)]
*  Let's say Philly loses to the Knicks [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=592.16s)]
*  and round one and then B, you know, goes trying to recover, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=594.12s)]
*  get in shape for next season. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=598.48s)]
*  And Josh Harris is like, what do you think I should do? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=599.76s)]
*  Because I could move on from this [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=603.88s)]
*  and get a player back in a bunch of picks? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=606.0400000000001s)]
*  Or when you have somebody who, when he's healthy, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=609.44s)]
*  is one of the five best players in the league, hands down, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=613.8000000000001s)]
*  how can you give that up for an unknown blank? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=617.76s)]
*  You can't. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=620.72s)]
*  So you kind of have to ride it out. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=622.0s)]
*  I just don't know what you do. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=623.88s)]
*  It's unsolvable. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=624.96s)]
*  And I don't know if there's been [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=626.4000000000001s)]
*  a lot of situations like this. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=627.4000000000001s)]
*  I thought the Quippers made a mistake [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=629.2800000000001s)]
*  when they extended Kawhi, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=630.6800000000001s)]
*  because to me that just felt like, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=632.84s)]
*  hey, let's just see a healthy year before, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=635.48s)]
*  you know, the money will be there. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=638.6800000000001s)]
*  We'll take care of you at the end of this season. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=639.7600000000001s)]
*  Let's see how this looks. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=641.36s)]
*  Kawhi, which I think is an important piece [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=643.5200000000001s)]
*  of the Embiid conversation. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=646.24s)]
*  Kawhi goes to the Quippers. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=648.36s)]
*  He plays 13 to 13 playoff games in 2020. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=649.48s)]
*  He plays 11 to 19 in 21, gets hurt, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=652.7199999999999s)]
*  misses the last eight, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=655.16s)]
*  misses the whole next season, no playoffs. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=656.68s)]
*  Last year, plays the first two, gets hurt again, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=658.7199999999999s)]
*  misses the last three. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=661.1999999999999s)]
*  This year, missed the one today. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=662.76s)]
*  He's played 26 to 38 playoff games. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=664.52s)]
*  I'm surprised it's that high. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=667.4399999999999s)]
*  And he's missed, but he also missed 2022 [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=668.76s)]
*  and then missed the playoffs. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=671.3199999999999s)]
*  So really it's even more than that. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=672.3199999999999s)]
*  And was not available to finish three of the last four [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=675.0799999999999s)]
*  post-seasons basically. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=678.92s)]
*  And they just extended him. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=680.3599999999999s)]
*  And it's like the Embiid thing. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=683.52s)]
*  I don't know how that gets better. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=684.36s)]
*  It's like, oh man, remember those four rough Kawhi years, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=686.76s)]
*  but now he's totally healthy. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=690.52s)]
*  I just don't see it. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=691.8000000000001s)]
*  And I don't see it because I've been [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=692.72s)]
*  following basketball long enough [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=694.08s)]
*  that when guys just keep getting hurt, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=696.2s)]
*  it usually doesn't get better. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=698.48s)]
*  When they hit their 30s, it gets worse. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=700.16s)]
*  And I know medicine's better and I know training's better [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=702.52s)]
*  and we know our body's better. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=705.32s)]
*  He's gotta get smaller. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=706.16s)]
*  He's gotta get smaller. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=706.9200000000001s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=708.2s)]
*  You're talking Embiid. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=709.0400000000001s)]
*  Right, now he's got the knee injury, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=709.88s)]
*  so I can't imagine there were many cardio options [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=711.28s)]
*  for a guy that big that's trying to rush back [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=713.52s)]
*  to even get back to even play in the playoffs. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=715.1999999999999s)]
*  Like a credit to him that he's even going like, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=716.8s)]
*  no, no, I'm not shutting this down. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=718.68s)]
*  Like I wanna be out there. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=719.88s)]
*  I wanna try to figure this whole thing out. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=720.88s)]
*  But the second he came back, you were like, uh-oh. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=722.4399999999999s)]
*  And he's still putting up 30. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=726.3199999999999s)]
*  Right, he's still putting up 30. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=727.76s)]
*  So I would think the biggest thing for him to try to, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=729.12s)]
*  because I don't think any sane person [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=732.56s)]
*  would disagree with this on this one. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=733.9599999999999s)]
*  Like if you're asking this simple question, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=735.36s)]
*  hey, here's the timeline of the last five years [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=736.72s)]
*  and this is how it's gone. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=739.52s)]
*  This is what it looked like yesterday [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=740.6s)]
*  and project the next five years. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=742.28s)]
*  Like if you're sitting there going, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=744.0s)]
*  oh no, it'll all work out. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=744.84s)]
*  Like, well, okay. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=746.5600000000001s)]
*  Telling the team that they would have [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=750.6s)]
*  to do something with him, that's not gonna happen [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=752.32s)]
*  because if Embiid was available tomorrow, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=754.76s)]
*  say in a free agent world, everybody would just pay him [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=756.5600000000001s)]
*  because I think a lot of these transactions are, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=758.36s)]
*  all right, but what if we have a chance [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=761.6s)]
*  that this guy is this good? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=764.28s)]
*  I think that's what the Kawhi thing is. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=765.4s)]
*  And granted, the Clippers don't have their picks [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=766.96s)]
*  and moving to the new place. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=768.44s)]
*  But that was the heart and trade too [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=769.28s)]
*  because the combo of the Kawhi extension [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=771.0400000000001s)]
*  and the heart and trade, at least we have a chance. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=771.88s)]
*  We can sell some hope to our fans. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=774.0400000000001s)]
*  Right, like this doesn't make a ton of sense. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=776.32s)]
*  Yep, there's tons of downside, a lot of risk. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=778.4000000000001s)]
*  But what else are we gonna do with our money? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=781.0400000000001s)]
*  So, now they've got Embiid under control [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=782.36s)]
*  for two more years as a player option back there. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=784.4000000000001s)]
*  So it's not like you even have to worry [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=786.4000000000001s)]
*  about that part of it. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=787.6400000000001s)]
*  You would probably just say, okay, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=788.8000000000001s)]
*  we need to do whatever we can [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=790.0s)]
*  to get him as healthy as possible [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=791.12s)]
*  and take another shot at it [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=793.2s)]
*  because we need to know he's right. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=794.8000000000001s)]
*  He's one of the five best players in the world [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=795.6800000000001s)]
*  and that's all we're gonna do. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=797.6800000000001s)]
*  Now it would be really interesting [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=798.6400000000001s)]
*  to see what happens with their cap space [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=800.4s)]
*  and if they don't get Paul George [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=801.48s)]
*  and if it's a bunch of one year deals [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=803.4399999999999s)]
*  to take another shot at cap space again, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=804.96s)]
*  is Embiid gonna be patient? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=808.72s)]
*  Like that could be the thing where it would be different [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=810.2s)]
*  because I'm always on the lookout for the next guy [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=815.4399999999999s)]
*  that would say, okay, this isn't working for me. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=817.64s)]
*  It's gonna be somebody from round one who loses. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=821.68s)]
*  Absolutely, we're doomed. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=824.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's, yeah. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=826.4s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=828.72s)]
*  The Lakers get knocked out in round one [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=831.9200000000001s)]
*  and Philly gets knocked out in round one [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=833.9200000000001s)]
*  and Josh Harris runs into Jeannie Buss [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=835.84s)]
*  and they're having wine and one thing leads to another [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=839.64s)]
*  and they start talking about Embiid and Davis. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=841.72s)]
*  Should we just flip them for each other? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=843.52s)]
*  Is J. Moore there? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=846.9200000000001s)]
*  J. Moore's there. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=848.6s)]
*  He's intrigued. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=849.6800000000001s)]
*  He's always liked Embiid, thinks he's funny. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=850.52s)]
*  Who pauses longer on that conversation? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=852.84s)]
*  Philly or Los Angeles? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=858.28s)]
*  LA do it. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=860.24s)]
*  LA would do it in a second, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=862.6s)]
*  so I think the pause is from Harris. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=863.76s)]
*  Because then the problem is, is like, okay, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=867.28s)]
*  this hypothetical, which we shouldn't be doing [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=869.0s)]
*  after game one, all right, we shouldn't, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=870.5600000000001s)]
*  we both know that. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=872.24s)]
*  No, listen, this is what we do in podcasts. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=873.08s)]
*  This is what we do. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=875.28s)]
*  We have dumb conversations and talk about. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=876.12s)]
*  This is the whole point of a podcast. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=877.64s)]
*  I love it, all right, so now that we've said that, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=879.32s)]
*  don't try this at home, right, like a little warning line. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=881.32s)]
*  You couldn't be, like you couldn't be Daryl [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=885.5200000000001s)]
*  and the entire group and go, okay, cool, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=887.6800000000001s)]
*  we have this transaction. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=891.2s)]
*  Now what? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=892.48s)]
*  Now what do we do? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=893.84s)]
*  So nobody's trading. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=896.1600000000001s)]
*  Davis and Maxi in calf space? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=897.0s)]
*  I kind of like it. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=898.6800000000001s)]
*  I kind of like it. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=902.2800000000001s)]
*  I kind of like it for both teams. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=903.12s)]
*  It reminds me of when Penny Hardaway got, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=905.84s)]
*  when he signed with Philly. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=907.9200000000001s)]
*  Remember the Orlando thing, like just too much stuff [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=909.48s)]
*  had happened and then he went to Phoenix [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=911.6800000000001s)]
*  and Orlando was like, we're devastated, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=914.84s)]
*  but deep down was like, I don't know, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=916.6s)]
*  not sure how many more good years that guy has. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=918.08s)]
*  Remember when Phoenix was apparently [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=921.24s)]
*  the only place you could go if you had injuries? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=922.5600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=924.76s)]
*  Like if this were 04, the podcast would have started. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=925.6s)]
*  They'd be like, you gotta get Embiid to Phoenix. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=928.16s)]
*  Suck in the water. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=930.24s)]
*  I think the Embiid we're watching right now [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=931.5600000000001s)]
*  is carrying too much weight and it's not working. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=934.4s)]
*  It's not working. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=936.72s)]
*  The guy we're watching right now is carrying too much weight [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=937.56s)]
*  and it's dangerous considering the stuff [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=939.3599999999999s)]
*  that has happened to his lower body. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=941.1199999999999s)]
*  Next year, who knows? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=943.0799999999999s)]
*  It's a tough one. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=946.88s)]
*  When he went down, I thought his season was over [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=948.76s)]
*  and next year was done. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=953.0799999999999s)]
*  He looked that bad when they showed [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=955.1999999999999s)]
*  he was lying on the ground. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=956.5999999999999s)]
*  It seemed like his eyes were rolling [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=958.1999999999999s)]
*  in the back of his head. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=960.64s)]
*  He looked like a Gachie. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=961.4799999999999s)]
*  Like that was like, oh my God, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=964.68s)]
*  this guy just blew out every, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=966.68s)]
*  and then 20 minutes he was back. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=968.04s)]
*  It's a roller coaster ride, man. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=972.28s)]
*  The draft was 10 years ago. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=973.5999999999999s)]
*  This is now a full decade of Embiid [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=975.12s)]
*  and I don't think Philly fans, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=977.16s)]
*  they're in the same position they were in [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=978.7199999999999s)]
*  when they drafted the guy and he had a broken foot [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=980.16s)]
*  where they're like, we don't know [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=982.0799999999999s)]
*  what we're getting from this dude. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=983.12s)]
*  But when he's out there and he's feeling it, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=985.9599999999999s)]
*  this is the guy who was averaging more points [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=987.8s)]
*  than minutes played in the season, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=991.04s)]
*  which I don't know if anyone had done that since Wilt. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=993.1999999999999s)]
*  So you're probably right. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=995.8s)]
*  Philly's gotta be like, all right, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=996.8399999999999s)]
*  we gotta talk ourselves back into this one. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflcVuc5EU0&t=998.0s)]
