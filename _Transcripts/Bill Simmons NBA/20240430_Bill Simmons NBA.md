# Bill Simmonsâ€™s Panic Playoff Draft | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_E-y7kQ93k)
*  All right.
*  So we're going to do the panic playoff draft only playoff teams eligible.
*  And as we went to break, Saruti told us that there's an athletic article.
*  Brian Curtis calls this the now they tell us article where the season ends.
*  And then there's immediately a story with inside anecdotes from the season that went
*  wrong.
*  This one they had just, I guess, cooked ready for those sons to get swept.
*  Uh, it's all about how, um, Frank Volgo basically lost the team halfway through
*  the year.
*  Durant doesn't like how he's been used.
*  This is stuff we've been hearing for the last month or so that if the sons lost,
*  Volgo was going to be on his way out.
*  Um, I'm glad they have somebody to blame the 2020 finals winning coach.
*  This was his fault.
*  But, uh, but that article came out and that ties into, um, what we're going to
*  talk about here with the panic playoff draft.
*  I'm going to give you first pick.
*  We have the nominees for the panic playoff drafts are, uh, you can take
*  Phoenix, you can take Milwaukee, Dallas or Clippers.
*  You have both.
*  They're, they count as one selection.
*  Philadelphia, New Orleans, Lakers, um, Miami, and then Cleveland or Orlando.
*  Most panicky team heading into the off season for you.
*  Is it Phoenix?
*  Yeah, it's Phoenix.
*  Okay.
*  I think we've talked about it already.
*  The lack of outs, the draft pick debts are absurd.
*  Can I give you some deets?
*  Please do.
*  The rant Beal Booker, uh, that's 150 million plus next year.
*  Nurkic is that going to be at 18.
*  Grayson Allen has an extension kicking in.
*  He's going to be at 15.6.
*  They have Nasir little somehow at 6.7.
*  So their second apron team going to be really hard for them to do anything.
*  Their picks 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37,
*  their picks 25, 27, and 29 go to Brooklyn.
*  They get the worst out of these swaps with all these weird teams and 24,
*  26, 28, and 30.
*  So their picks are going to, they basically have four first that they're
*  not going to be allowed to trade.
*  And then all those seconds, there's a chunk of the seconds
*  that all go to Washington too.
*  Yeah.
*  And they lost all their seconds.
*  And if you had to say who's out between Durant Booker, who would you pick?
*  Durant.
*  So where does he go?
*  I don't know.
*  Let's see.
*  Who wins this year?
*  Come on.
*  Hey man.
*  I mean, he's made it real hard.
*  He's made it real hard on a relationship.
*  I've defended him for a really long time and I'm not just talking about the
*  series, you're going to fucking do this again.
*  You're going to do it again.
*  You know, I mean, Lakers fans in LeBron tried to do this with Vogel and it's
*  like, oh cool, now you got Darwin Ham problem solve great work everybody.
*  So I'm not telling you like, I loved everything I saw from Phoenix, but they
*  were all in and out of the lineup.
*  I think Vogel's a good coach.
*  So you're there one year.
*  You don't like the way you were used.
*  I don't know.
*  Take it to the fucking hoop.
*  No, it was Vogel telling you don't.
*  So if you're going to ask for a trade from Brooklyn, when the extension's about
*  to kick in, which is the new normal now in this league, I got to dig around a
*  little bit more.
*  Let me see what he says, but he makes it tough for you to continuously have his
*  back on some of these decisions.
*  If it's true that he's going to want his way out of this after an exit, like at
*  some point, man, I was with him when he was like, I, I just don't know if I can
*  play with Russell Westbrook anymore and I need to do city.
*  And it's like, I get it, man.
*  Then he was in the Warriors and it's like, you know, it's a Steph's team.
*  Kind of want my own team.
*  It's like, all right, I don't get that as much.
*  Steph's like one of the great teammates of all time, but you know, everybody's
*  got, got the right to follow their own destiny.
*  So he goes to New York with Kyrie.
*  Didn't really get that.
*  They get James Harden.
*  Now it's the three of them that didn't really work hard and Lee and the
*  hardened leaves him and Kyrie.
*  I don't know what happened there, but all of a sudden Katie's ready to go.
*  They say, Hey, what are you talking about?
*  You just got here.
*  We're not trading it.
*  Half the fire.
*  Everybody.
*  Bye.
*  No fire everybody.
*  And I'll stay Steve that Steve that.
*  Yep.
*  Steve Nash goes, you gotta, you gotta keep Jacques on.
*  This is our guy.
*  All right.
*  We'll keep them.
*  And then two months later, he's getting traded goes to Phoenix.
*  Who was the coach last year for Phoenix?
*  I'm blanking.
*  Who's a Monty Williams.
*  Yeah.
*  Monty's out.
*  Bring in Frank Vogel.
*  Let's bring in Bradley Beale.
*  I'm still not happy.
*  It's tough.
*  It's a tough look for him.
*  It's tough to defend.
*  I can't defend it.
*  So I'm not going to try.
*  I can't either.
*  Booker I think fetches a bigger price than Durant at age 36.
*  And if they wanted to get a better price, they could have done it.
*  Yeah.
*  And if they wanted to get serious about this, that's why you're keeping them.
*  Yeah.
*  Which is not, and he's under contract for four more years.
*  So it doesn't, it's, it doesn't even the conversation.
*  The only thing you'd have to worry about in the way this stuff works is if Booker.
*  So like, I thought there would come a time where they kept losing.
*  It was Sarver still owning the team.
*  He was cheap.
*  And then Chris Paul came in and saved everything.
*  You know, I mean, look, I know he didn't win a round, but he did win a round.
*  I mean, look, I know he didn't win a ring, but the thing entirely changed.
*  Once Paul showed up, they're winning games Booker's in.
*  He's starting to get the notoriety that I, I think he deserved.
*  And this whole thing, no, I don't know.
*  There's just certain players that I look at and be like, okay, this is entirely
*  his fault and there's other players.
*  I'm like, I don't know about that.
*  Like I just would have way more sympathy for Booker being one of the original guys
*  there and the fact that he's younger and he plays, I know he's had some injury
*  stuff this year, he's actually missed some games over the years, but he's still
*  younger and he's locked up for four years.
*  And by the way, you're not going to, I mean, what do you think they're going to do?
*  Do you like the Brooklyn?
*  I mean, now we're just podcasting, right?
*  But you do the Brooklyn where you think, well, can you trade?
*  Well, trade the asset to recoup some of the picks.
*  We're in this new era where you don't have any of your picks.
*  So you like basically where Brooklyn is where you run and rebuild and you have
*  somebody else's picks, but not your picks.
*  So you don't want to get too bad.
*  And you know, this is how they basically solve tanking.
*  Nobody can tank cause nobody has their picks.
*  It's going to be the new MBA.
*  It's going to be 30 teams.
*  Nobody has their own picks.
*  Uh, Booker would be an interesting one.
*  But then why would you do it?
*  Cause then you'd have to tear the whole thing down and you don't have any of your
*  own picks.
*  So then you'd have to be trying to figure out, Hey, do we, you know, that's the
*  thing about trading to rant is you go, cool, you guys can have them.
*  And then two years, we'll get your good picks.
*  If this is all going to happen, you know, it's, it's, this is two hours
*  after the game ended, so.
*  Come in, get Draymond and a couple first.
*  That doesn't do anything for me.
*  For the warriors or for the sons.
*  Julius Randall and three, no, no, let's go back.
*  Cause actually Julius Randall and three first for KD.
*  That's how I think he stays.
*  I, I, whatever the price is for him has dropped dramatically.
*  Let's go back to the commingle one.
*  Oh, I got you in.
*  All right.
*  Okay.
*  Cause that would be an incredible, like we're running it back.
*  Golden state zag on like, do they start to get creative this off season?
*  It's like when bad boys for life, when Martin Lawrence and Will Smith were
*  like, fuck it, let's make a third one.
*  Well, that's the problem with the soft cap is that you end up doing stuff you
*  don't want to do because you can't ever.
*  Recruit the salary slot, although it become more restrictive with this.
*  And it's actually great for players in a way.
*  Well, wait, we don't want to resign you.
*  Oh my God.
*  That's how much you're going to get.
*  Okay.
*  But we don't want to lose you for nothing.
*  So maybe we'll trade you in two years.
*  So here's your contract, even though we hate it.
*  You know what else is going to be weird?
*  The team USA where a lot of these guys are all together and a lot of these
*  storylines are going to be kind of happening in real time.
*  Like I tweeted this on Friday, but aunt took the two guard spot from Booker.
*  I think Booker was the starting to guard and now it has to be an aunt.
*  And it's going to, it has a chance to be, it's going to be LeBron
*  Curry and aunt as the face of the team basically.
*  Um, but now you have Booker and Katie and that team, you're going to have LeBron.
*  God knows what he's going to pull this summer.
*  If they get bounced in five, I'm prepared for literally anything with him.
*  You know, you're going down the line.
*  It's what happens if Boston, you know, loses in the Eastern finals, like they,
*  it's just, and then they're all going to be in France together with all this drama.
*  It's been a really quiet few months, man.
*  Well, it's not going to be much quiet.
*  Listen, I took five weeks off last year.
*  I have not taken five weeks off this year.
*  I'm going to be, I'm going to be doing stuff.
*  All right.
*  So we have Phoenix.
*  I'll go next.
*  It's obviously Milwaukee.
*  I mean, it's Phoenix and Milwaukee is your two panic teams.
*  Um, the Milwaukee thing's brutal because that Dame contract just gets worse
*  and worse and worse and worse and worse.
*  They can swap New Orleans can swap picks with them, which some
*  walkie keeps their pick this year.
*  They do not have their 25, 27 or 29.
*  And they have some swaps going on in 26, 28 and 30.
*  And that team looks old.
*  Cause they are.
*  Cause they are.
*  And you watch them today and, and, uh, it was a little alarming
*  without their two best guys.
*  Nothing today doesn't even count.
*  Today's just like, you just realized the three through 12, like how grim it is.
*  And I wonder like, could there be, could they maybe call Miami and be like,
*  Hey, remember when you guys want to trade hero and Yovitch and the
*  Hawkeyes pick for Dame with some picks?
*  Like, is that still on the table for you guys?
*  Or what are you thinking?
*  Kick the tires on that.
*  If there's one team, as long as everybody's okay there and not pulling a,
*  eh, I tried it out.
*  I'm out of here.
*  That team probably is more likely to run it back and some of these other panic
*  teams, you took Miami or Milwaukee.
*  Milwaukee.
*  Okay.
*  Unless we get our first international player who's a superstar.
*  Cause I've always pointed this out, but I mean, it's just because it's
*  always been the American guys.
*  It doesn't mean it's never going to be an international guy.
*  Just we need some.
*  It almost happened in October.
*  I mean, it really, I think they thought that was going to potentially happen.
*  Who?
*  Yannis.
*  I think that was closer than was reported or people realized.
*  I think that was one of the things that led to the dame trade.
*  So anyway, Milwaukee is in trouble.
*  Uh, who would you put, would you put Dallas or the Clippers as the third panic team?
*  Who who's more panicky?
*  Cause one of those two teams is going to lose the series and then go, wait a
*  second, what?
*  Yeah.
*  But when I look at it, I think of like panic of panic equaling actual
*  transactions, cause the Clippers would probably just want to resign everybody.
*  Even though it hasn't worked and go, this is better than not resigning
*  everybody for the reasons that we've already pointed out.
*  I think Dallas would go, we were really good in the second half.
*  Tweak here, tweak there.
*  It was hurt.
*  Luka was talking after the game, after we did part one, he was talking about how
*  he feels like he let down Kyrie.
*  Kyrie has been amazing.
*  I'm not playing well enough.
*  I got to do better.
*  Like he had some of that stuff.
*  So they, they could talk themselves into, Whoa, what if Luka gets healthy next
*  year and we get the same Kyrie season?
*  That doesn't have its picks and Luka is still young enough.
*  And this is really only the first full year with Kyrie.
*  So I don't, it would be really disappointing loss on either end.
*  Uh, certainly more so for Dallas because the Clippers don't have Kauai, but I
*  think I'm going to go with Philly as my pick as your third pick.
*  Okay.
*  Make the case.
*  They've got to use that cap space on somebody significant.
*  And if Paul George is not on the table, like after Paul George has that
*  game three with seven points, you know, you just making the rounds and seeing
*  people be like, well, you know, I don't even want him.
*  You know, like you hope you have the option to say like, yes to him.
*  Okay.
*  Uh, unless you're going to get really, really creative of like a, a bad free
*  agent class because they get worse and worse all the time, there's very rarely
*  like the good ones anymore that you're excited about, like for the guys.
*  Cause I'll just do extensions now.
*  Um, if you're Paul George, would you be other than the LAPs, would you be super
*  pumped to just resign with the clips if they lost to Dallas and like six?
*  The only way it happens is if he feels like the Kawhi deal, like the Clippers
*  weren't as committed to him as they were to Kawhi and then maybe ego's getting
*  true.
*  Yeah.
*  Which is true.
*  Yeah.
*  So maybe that is all Darryl needs and it's a better landing spot than all
*  these other teams that are bad.
*  I mean, more landos has space.
*  Maybe it's what Orlando needs.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  I mean, if I'm Paul George and my choices are Orlando and Philly, you
*  know what I'm doing going to Orlando.
*  It's not even, it's not even a debate.
*  Did you say that Paul George seems like the perfect fit personality wise for the
*  greater Orlando area?
*  Did I say that?
*  Yeah.
*  Cause I think you did.
*  And I think it's great.
*  Hey, I'll, I'll claim it.
*  I don't remember if I said it or not, but I'll take it.
*  If you think of Paul George, like, yeah, you know, loves Orlando.
*  Paul George.
*  Yeah.
*  It sounds great.
*  He's over celebration, like on his day off, just walks around.
*  He's like, this is crazy.
*  Roller coasters, 24 seven, 365, cotton candy.
*  Like you read about.
*  He's literally what they need.
*  I mean, imagine next year, Suggs, Paul George, Palo, France, guard TBD that
*  that there's something there.
*  The or length though magic.
*  Oh my God.
*  That'd be great.
*  And the net the modern bill wrestled Jonathan Isaac.
*  If, if they don't have, so if Philly can't land something really significant,
*  and maybe it's the next mad guy getting traded into their cap space, which.
*  No, it was always potentially on the table.
*  If this were to be a weird, so I just feel like we're going to have a weird summer.
*  Um, if Philly can't do that and they have to use the cap space to like piece it
*  together and then they got to tell him B like, Hey, we didn't, we weren't able to
*  figure it out.
*  And the thing that really sucks for him too is these hardened minutes should have
*  been going to somebody better than roll guys that could disappear on a night and
*  you wouldn't even notice them like, Hey, cool.
*  I love the tomb's effort.
*  And I know they're getting some picks back out of it, but like that's a devastating
*  blow, even if I don't love hardened later in the playoffs, it's like, that's
*  a good point about today where Kyrie looks awesome.
*  That's a double loss for Durant.
*  Who's just that this is a professional low for him other than the Achilles.
*  And then same thing for Philly.
*  They have this terrible loss and two hours later, hardened is
*  fucking destroying Detroit on the same little swoop play over and over again.
*  It's like, huh, we had that guy.
*  Well, I think, I think the Philly thing is way more chaotic than maybe it seems
*  right now, cause if they lose to the Knicks in game five, I don't know.
*  All bets are off for me with that team.
*  Here's what I would ask.
*  Like would Embiid, if I gave you the two options, if we want to be
*  completely irresponsible here and we're not reporters who cares, but.
*  If they don't get anybody, does he ask for a trade?
*  Does Embiid go, this is awesome.
*  Or does Embiid say, Hey, I need to be better.
*  Or does he do what most pro athletes do and go, Hey, I'm not going to
*  need younger and I'm hurt all the time.
*  Like I tried it.
*  Ben sucked the hardened thing sucked.
*  And then we didn't get anybody for them.
*  And then we had all this cap space and you know, we don't really have any.
*  All these New York fans were at my playoff game.
*  They hurt my feelings.
*  Um, that's not a LeBron destination, right?
*  Well, remember when he was a free agent before he went to the Lakers?
*  Like that was the thing.
*  Those guys, I think clutch was really putting it out there that Philly would
*  be a potential destination to just try to drive the competition, get LeBron.
*  And then they didn't even take a meeting.
*  So I don't know.
*  If you just replace Tobias Harris with LeBron, I would say the Sixers are a
*  more interesting playoff team.
*  I don't know what version they'll get with LeBron in year 22.
*  By the way, I did my best free agent signings pyramid in part one of the pod.
*  I forgot LeBron of the Lakers.
*  There's a third LeBron free agency both of us forgot.
*  Which that's a good one.
*  Yeah.
*  With the title.
*  Yeah.
*  That's going to be in the top 10, right?
*  Yeah, I guess.
*  But it was almost like that wasn't totally a free agent signing because
*  everyone know he was going there, but I guess it counts.
*  Well, it does based on the way you did it.
*  You still had Butler lower than he should have been.
*  If you make it to two NBA finals with the heat and that team wasn't great
*  either year, I think with all was a finals MVP.
*  It was a fun exercise.
*  All right.
*  So you took Philly.
*  I'm going to take, uh, I'm going to take the Clippers just because.
*  I think the Kawhi extension, the fact that they did it when he had played
*  well for a couple of weeks and they're like, Oh, he looks great.
*  Here's more, more years.
*  Don't want to lose this guy.
*  Um, and now they have that hanging over the franchise again.
*  It's, it's now a half a decade of, of this dance with them.
*  So you have for fifth, would you say Dallas or would you say, uh,
*  would you say the Lakers?
*  Panic is the word here.
*  Um,
*  does New Orleans finally go, Hey, they have to, you have to.
*  Yeah.
*  But think about what we're saying here.
*  We're naming like seven guys like, all right.
*  And that's what was so interesting about the drama of this playoffs.
*  You're going to have these really disappointing exits this year.
*  Ingram is not going to be in the Pelicans next year.
*  I'm going to pick New Orleans.
*  They're going to trade Ingram somewhere for something.
*  I think that's, that would be the one prediction I feel the best about.
*  For Harrison healed summer movement.
*  No, I think he'd have value for some of these teams.
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  It would be like, what, like if you're Detroit, you're like, Oh,
*  we can get Brandon Ingram.
*  Absolutely.
*  Yeah.
*  Is there a possible Atlanta?
*  Does that a, could there be a Trey Young?
*  You know, could you get super frisky?
*  Could there be a mega deal?
*  The Lakers might be a better pick then if you're talking about panic
*  and something more drastic, I could see them just dumping those.
*  If they re-sign LeBron, they're dumping the picks and they're adding the best
*  available, maybe two time all-star they can find.
*  And I don't know if that's Trey Young.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know if that's Trey Young.
*  I don't know if it's a Brandon Ingram.
*  I don't know how Trey Young changes their destiny in any conceivable way.
*  Well, I'm not saying I think it start printing banners here, but that's a Laker.
*  No, I have Laker fans in my life who are like, just so I'm getting Trey.
*  Well, they don't.
*  Like, okay, cool.
*  That's the, I'm sure they're just grinding Atlanta games out here in LA at four o'clock.
*  Good luck with Trey and LeBron as 40% of your defense.
*  Let me know how that goes.
*  This place is too nice.
*  40 years old.
*  How many of the West Coast is watching Hawks games at four Pacific time?
*  I would have the Lakers.
*  All right.
*  New Orleans.
*  The only, the only panic would be they're hitting shit or get off the
*  pot stage with the roster.
*  Like, what are you gonna do with all these picks?
*  What do you do with all these assets?
*  Do you really think Zion and Trey Murphy and Brandon Ingram, do you need all
*  three of those guys?
*  Is CJ really going to be your guard who's going to decide big stretches and
*  playoff games for you or can you upgrade that?
*  Like they're, they're, they're going to have to go all in at some point here.
*  And I think this would be the summer to think about that, especially as
*  OKC gets better and better.
*  Denver has Yoke-age.
*  Minnesota has this ant fucking freight train coming.
*  Like you, those are the three teams you're looking at now and you have to,
*  you know, you have to compete with them.
*  Um, two picks Dyson and some filler for Durant.
*  If you were in New Orleans.
*  I mean on paper.
*  Yeah.
*  But does Durant want to go to New Orleans?
*  Would he be happy?
*  Oh, you're only getting it for a year before he asked for trade.
*  Anyway, if this Phoenix story is true.
*  He's got two years less than his deal.
*  No, I know.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm kidding about the Phoenix story.
*  Oh, I just feel like we talked about it and went pretty deep on it and I
*  haven't even read it yet and I haven't heard anything.
*  So I don't know.
*  We'll see.
*  If we're just talking, what's the most fun?
*  Durant to Golden State is the most fun.
*  If they're just like, we're running it back.
*  It's like when it gets back together, it's like, Oh, the police are back together.
*  Sting and Sting and Stewart Copeland and Andy Summers.
*  They're all talking.
*  They're going to do a tour.
*  We're like, what?
*  That'd be the worst.
*  And I just wonder if Andy would be like, they were like actually Andy signed
*  with Orlando Miami Panic ate all of you.
*  No, I think they, they didn't have Butler.
*  They didn't have Rosario and Yovitch is going to be really good.
*  Joe Cronin regrets.
*  Could at Hawkeyes, Yovitch and hero plus some picks for Dame, a trade that we
*  both thought was a stupid trade for them.
*  Cause they had so many guards.
*  Well, I just didn't think hero was as good as Maxie.
*  Like that was one of the other things that was being floated out there.
*  Yeah.
*  If they could have done this deal and then, you know, they traded for two
*  players, ultimately with all the pieces that moved around that are really
*  hurt all the time, like Rob Williams.
*  I don't know why you would have been able to depend on him and then
*  Brogdon gets hurt on top of everything else.
*  But you see the Aitin stats last seven, eight weeks of the year.
*  Aitin was putting up big numbers, man.
*  I thought I couldn't believe how bad his numbers were the first half of the season.
*  I was expecting huge Aitin numbers all year long.
*  He was like 22 and 14 for the last two months of the season.
*  And he was saying, finally, I'm getting to show who DeAndre Aitin is.
*  I think he might have third person'd himself.
*  Not as many times as Malik neighbors did on Thursday night, but
*  if I were tanking, I would sign Westbrook to a four year deal with three player
*  option or excuse me, three team options.
*  And I would trade for eight.
*  But the thing is I'd probably still be too good.
*  And I've been like 25.
*  And then we didn't even mention Cleveland, which I think would be the, the
*  other possible panic team more from a sense of Mitchell being the last year of his
*  deal and if he wants to go somewhere, you, you start to push for it this summer.
*  If there's one consistent, Hey, what do you think happens this summer?
*  The most consistent one is that they have to do something because he's not going to
*  stay and they have a year left on it.
*  So if we were talking realistic moves, instead of just ranking it and the
*  panicky thing, which I'm still not quite sure what it is, they're a higher pick,
*  but I don't feel like them losing is as dramatic as Dallas losing in the first
*  round of the Clippers without Kawhi or the Clippers being just stuck in purgatory.
*  Same thing with the Pelicans Philadelphia.
*  If they were to miss out on big free agents, you know, I think
*  Cleveland could go, all right.
*  We lost in the first round.
*  We've had this group for two years.
*  There's still a bunch of young guys and now we have a Mitchell decision.
*  Our winner is Phoenix.
