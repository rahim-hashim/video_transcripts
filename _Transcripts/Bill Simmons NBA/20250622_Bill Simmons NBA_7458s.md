# OKC’s First NBA Title, Haliburton’s Awful Injury, and the Durant Trade  | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8)
*  basically named Asumping with You. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=0.0s)]
*  All right. We were recording live after the trophy celebration game seven, the NBA finals. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=30.0s)]
*  Ryan Marcello is here. We brought in Zach Lowe for this one. We thought this was going to be a special night. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=35.04s)]
*  It was definitely a memorable night. It was a sad night. It was a happy night for OKC fans. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  Sad night for basketball fans. I've never watched a game seven like that in my life. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=44.08s)]
*  We're still. I'm going to start here. I think this might be the first NBA playoffs that comes and goes [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=49.84s)]
*  with the team. I'm going to remember is in the team that won the title. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=57.599999999999994s)]
*  When I think of it first, as weird as that sounds, I can't think of another playoffs. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=60.32s)]
*  You always think of the champ first. You go through. It's like 21 Janice. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=66.0s)]
*  20 LeBron and the Lakers in the bubble. Like you go on through this one. I'll be thinking, OK, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=70.47999999999999s)]
*  see when but Indy and they'll be right in the sentence with them. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I wanted to wait until it felt like kind of a bummed out recap of game seven, but I guess [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  it's already there because I think all of us that were watching this news, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=85.76s)]
*  you saw Halliburton go down. You know, like, all right, how are they going to do this? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=88.4s)]
*  And then they're up at half. It actually felt like the Halliburton injury messed up OKC more [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=92.48s)]
*  than it did the Pacers. So that would be like the first thing that I had from the game. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=99.6s)]
*  We look like you guys seriously going to let this happen to you where it's the Doc Rivers [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=105.12s)]
*  theory, but it's Doc Rivers theory in game. Well, and then on top of it, even when these down, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=109.36s)]
*  what was it? They were down like 18 late Zach in the fourth quarter and Mathur made a couple [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=114.24s)]
*  plays. You're like, are they going to do this? Like I wasn't counting it out. They're down 103, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  89 or whatever was four minutes left. I'm like, I don't know. Maybe they could do this. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=124.56s)]
*  I literally went into the living room to watch the last five minutes of the game with my wife [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=128.72s)]
*  and talk her through the Halliburton injury because she was watching it in the other room. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=133.68s)]
*  I'm watching in my office. So like it's over. And then I'm like, I look up the score. I'm watching [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=136.72s)]
*  math. I literally said to her, I think I might have to go back to my office and take this, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=140.32s)]
*  like watch this with a little closer. I know this team would not go away. Man, the Halliburton. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=145.44s)]
*  I mean, there's so many decade ramifications for this. Like obviously the Pacers next year, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=156.0s)]
*  we can go into all of that a lot later. So did you think they, did you think they actually had [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=161.04s)]
*  a chance to win tonight when you watched the first five minutes pre injury? What were your [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=165.76s)]
*  thoughts before he goes down? Well, look, every single time somebody asked me about each one of [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=169.76s)]
*  these games, I would just go like this Pacer story is crazy, but eventually the talent and the defense [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=176.39999999999998s)]
*  of what OKC is. And I know a little bit later, I want to share some of their statistical profile [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=182.88s)]
*  stuff from all these playoff games. Cause you're like, this team just won the championship and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=187.28s)]
*  it's because of this defense. And it's because of that takeover in the third quarter. So I wouldn't [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=190.48s)]
*  rule out anything with the Pacers because we've all come away incredibly impressed and just their [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=193.92s)]
*  toughness and how they're built and who they are and their belief and all that stuff. So I think [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=200.72s)]
*  everybody just kind of raving about them on social media. But in those first few minutes, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=206.0s)]
*  I thought there was like two things that were going to stand out. SGA was not ready for how [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=210.88s)]
*  much they collapsed on him in game six. It was pretty obvious he had a career high turnovers. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  And with his passing tonight, you could see that he had adjusted for that. However, OKC, all of [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=220.88s)]
*  these threes are wide open and they still miss them. This is their ninth game in these playoffs [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=226.16s)]
*  where they're 30% or lower from three point. But yeah, I guess I never really ruled anything out. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=231.92s)]
*  Even as Zach was saying, they're up OKC is up 22. You're like this thing's over. And then it's the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=238.32s)]
*  Matheran show. And you're like, what the hell? Like in that five, that six to five minute mark, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  they've already chipped away 10 points on this thing. I was getting ideas, Zach, because two [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=249.04000000000002s)]
*  things they were calling it tight early, which I thought if the recipe for any to win is, are they [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=253.44s)]
*  going to call it tight? Is OKC going to look tight? And then could Indy come out, hit some threes and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=259.2s)]
*  start? And they went to time out and Hal Burton was mean mug in the crowd. And I was like, OK, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=265.84000000000003s)]
*  this is if Indy was going to steal this game. This is the recipe. And I think OKC was even four for [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=270.64s)]
*  17 from three at halftime. And then the defense took over. That was it. I thought your question [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=277.04s)]
*  to Ryan was actually, did you think they had a chance to win after the injury and at half? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=284.88s)]
*  Well, that's I guess that's another question. Because my answer to your actual question is, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=290.64000000000004s)]
*  of course, I thought they had a chance to win with Halliburton playing well. I thought this was like [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  not quite a coin flip game. I predicted OKC by four. That was my random OKC really close prediction. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=298.96000000000004s)]
*  Of course, I thought they had a chance to win. And I don't think you're wrong to say the runner [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=304.72s)]
*  up is as memorable or more memorable than the champion, because this was like some sports magic [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=310.16s)]
*  stuff that happened to the Pacers, like actual. And I'm not just talking about the crazy Halliburton [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=317.44000000000005s)]
*  end of game shots and buzzer beaters and miracle comebacks and all that. I'm talking about like, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=323.04s)]
*  you know, I was talking to the GM of another team today and I was like, what do you take out [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=327.92s)]
*  of this Pacers thing? What do they win or lose? And he said, hope we take hope because [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=331.12s)]
*  they are a study in like alchemy and the whole adding up to way more than the sum of its parts. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=337.12s)]
*  Like something magical happened to them in the nexus of style of play slash unique superstar [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=343.6s)]
*  chemistry, toughness, how personalities and games all mesh together. It was like it was magic. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=350.88s)]
*  And when they're up one at halftime, you allow yourself to think like, are they actually going [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=357.44s)]
*  to do this? I know I thought the whole time they're just are not going to be able to score [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=362.16s)]
*  enough points in Oklahoma City is not going to have to even play a good offensive game to win [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=366.32s)]
*  this game. They're just going to grind them to dust piece by piece by piece, drip by drip by drip. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=370.48s)]
*  And that's what happened. But I like this was a magical thing that happened for the last two [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=375.04s)]
*  months, even even extending into the regular season, obviously. And it's it's just I mean, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=379.92s)]
*  it's just such a gut punch for it to end this way. I mean, the shot, I don't know if you guys are [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=386.4s)]
*  still watching of Halliburton on crutches in the hallway, McConnell reading every day, hugging him [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=390.64s)]
*  is just it's like I know the Thunder are celebrating. They should celebrate. They were [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=396.08s)]
*  the best team all year. It just there's no question that it feels like everybody, including the Pacers [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=401.03999999999996s)]
*  and starting with the Pacers, was robbed of what should have been an epic, epic moment in the NBA. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=407.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it's. As you know, I love sports movies and there was that moment in halftime where you're [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=413.6s)]
*  thinking like this doesn't even feel like a real real life thing anymore. This actually feels like [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=419.36s)]
*  a sports movie. This is like watching the Friday Night Lights movie when they're going in the [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=424.08s)]
*  finals trying and then they lose at the end. It's like, oh my God, the scrappy underdogs, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=428.71999999999997s)]
*  the way they responded to losing their best guy in the worst possible way, you know, it's almost [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=434.15999999999997s)]
*  like you're getting hit by a sniper from the crowd or something when you go down like that and to [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=440.88s)]
*  and to just have them be like, shake it up and like, all right, let's let's stay focused. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=445.12s)]
*  I don't know how you stay focused in a moment like that. Like it certainly when it happened [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=448.8s)]
*  in the Celtics a couple of rounds ago, the game was basically over at that point. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=453.36s)]
*  But Indiana, they had 43 minutes left in the game and I agree that I thought it affected both teams. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=458.0s)]
*  I could not. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=464.96000000000004s)]
*  And OK, so even a little more and they were saying the crowd was kind of [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=465.92s)]
*  kind of like, what do you do for the crowd? You know, the whole thing, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=469.68s)]
*  definitely one of the weirdest things I've ever seen in a big game. So can you think of [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=473.76s)]
*  in any other like this is a do or die game and you bring in this variable that nobody's expecting. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=479.84000000000003s)]
*  I couldn't even concentrate on the next half hour of the game. Like I didn't even really take notes. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=485.76s)]
*  I don't know. I was watching it and you know, in the end, I was hanging around, but I don't [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=490.72s)]
*  really know. I don't really know what happened in the first half. I was just like kind of stupefied. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=495.2s)]
*  It was like, did that just happen? These games, I think the last two, the first [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=500.56s)]
*  has been played at such a frantic pace. And I don't know that that showed out in the pace [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=505.68s)]
*  numbers because that was a big thing that we talked about with the way paces have run to East [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=510.24s)]
*  because OKC was going to be comfortable doing some of that stuff. But I think the energy, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=514.3199999999999s)]
*  right, the effort, the sheer effort that you see the paces throughout, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=518.3199999999999s)]
*  you either match it or you don't. And you see what happens in game six for OKC. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=522.16s)]
*  And then it always felt like the games when they came out in the second half, like the last couple, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=527.1999999999999s)]
*  it was just even though you just come off this break, you could see that that first half was [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=531.12s)]
*  like draining for all these guys. And, you know, I expected OKC to shoot it better because the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=536.0799999999999s)]
*  role players are going to shoot it better at home traditionally. But I don't know, man. Like it was, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=544.88s)]
*  I think it actually speaks to the Pacers in that all they've done is fight now for months. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=551.12s)]
*  And if Halliburton's going down, as much as the three of us could be sitting here, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=556.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm like, how do you reset yourself? Like, because it happened so fast, like you're out there. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=560.32s)]
*  There's nothing. There's no other game. And if anything, right, they've proven that they're [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=564.72s)]
*  going to respond. So I yeah, at halftime, Nemhart hits that shot. You're like, they're up one. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=570.32s)]
*  And you think you know how to talk about it at halftime when they do in the half time show, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=578.48s)]
*  they're like what's like they didn't even ask Bob Myers. You were in this exact spot six years ago. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=583.2800000000001s)]
*  I could think of one one game. One thing they could have talked about at halftime. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=588.72s)]
*  Well, I mean, it would have been how I led the show. Like Bob, this you had KD coming back from [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=593.12s)]
*  a from a calf strain in 2019. You were worried about he came back and he made the injury worse. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=600.08s)]
*  Everyone was saying this wouldn't happen to Halbert. And then it happened. I mean, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=605.12s)]
*  I got to admit when he had the calf strain game five, I Googled all the Achilles injuries and [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=609.44s)]
*  it didn't seem like there was any sort of rhyme or reason to whether there was a connection or not. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=614.96s)]
*  Some people are like, it's two different injuries. But this was exactly what happened to KD. It's [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=620.64s)]
*  hard not to think this was just the sequel to it. And I mean, there's a bigger this one. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=625.12s)]
*  You think this is different than KD just because it's game seven. It's a couple of minutes in. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=630.8s)]
*  Well, I'm saying it's the same situation where he's coming back playing hurt on an injury that if [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=636.56s)]
*  it was the regular season, he's out for three weeks, four weeks, like he's resting it. But he [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=641.68s)]
*  was playing on an injury he shouldn't be playing on normally. They were claiming it wasn't going [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=646.16s)]
*  to make any worse. And then, you know, it gets gets worse. And I just don't know what's going on. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=651.28s)]
*  This is a whole separate topic. And it was one that I was texting with a bunch of different [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=659.92s)]
*  people on. It's like, where are these Achilles injuries coming from? These used to be old man [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=663.68s)]
*  injuries. They're now happening. These dudes are in the prime of their career and Tatum's case and [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=667.28s)]
*  Hal Burton's case. And I just don't fully understand it. And I know that's going to be a huge topic over [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=672.0s)]
*  the next four or five days. But it's maybe some of the stuff we've talked about on past pods about [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=678.72s)]
*  how the sport's harder to play. There's more running, there's more training and the miles that [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=684.4s)]
*  you're carrying are from a AU is they're just more wear and tear in these guys. But it doesn't [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=689.2s)]
*  make sense to me why guys who are 2426 27 years old are blowing out their Achilles. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=693.44s)]
*  Well, the other difference with Durant too is Durant hadn't played in a month. And then he [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=700.08s)]
*  came back and like the reason it feels a little it doesn't feel that different to me, but the [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=704.1600000000001s)]
*  difference to help aren't just kept playing through this and play pretty well last game. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=709.12s)]
*  But look, I mean, like it's a hard game to talk about because we should this should be a crowning [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=713.44s)]
*  moment for the Oklahoma City Thunder for just the greatest quickest rebuild from from the from [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=716.8s)]
*  bottoming out kind of to utter dominance and having a team that is literally the best team [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=726.4799999999999s)]
*  ever probably in all the professional sports, the best position to win now and win later of any team [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=731.8399999999999s)]
*  that maybe has ever existed and it is their crowning moment. But I think like in 15 years, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=737.4399999999999s)]
*  the number one thing we'll remember from this game is that Tyrese Haliburton in a game that we were [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=742.56s)]
*  all jacked up to watch got hurt seven minutes into the game and in a game where all the casual [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=746.24s)]
*  fans are watching like this was one of the this is like my wife and my daughter are watching this [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=751.6800000000001s)]
*  one. My dad's here. My dad and I got to watch Keegan Bradley somehow get back come back on Tommy [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=756.96s)]
*  Fleetwood and the Hartford Open today. That was that was a fun sports moment. This was not as fun [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=763.12s)]
*  to watch. I'll burn go down. I don't know. We're so low. What the OKC piece of this. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=768.48s)]
*  I think makes a crucial point that this might be the beginning of, you know, a half a decade run. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=776.24s)]
*  I feel like you and I have talked about this after titles before. Like we did this. We talked about [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=783.04s)]
*  this after the Denver finals. I remember like Jesus, you're okay. They're both so young. Like [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=787.6s)]
*  we kind of do this after every finals. But in this case, with how young they are and feel like [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=793.52s)]
*  they've peaked with whatever their core is, it feels like that's two years away. So this is [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=797.84s)]
*  pretty unique. There's no reason to think that this is Jalen Williams peak. There's certainly [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=802.32s)]
*  no reason to think that it's Chet's peak. I mean, offensively, he was so good defensively tonight, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=806.8000000000001s)]
*  especially close that one out, you know, and the Pacers want to go small because they want to be [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=811.9200000000001s)]
*  chaotic. They wanted to try to challenge all the inbounds. I mean, OKC didn't have a time [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=816.48s)]
*  after Caruso can get the ball in. So they were going to have a time out the rest of the game. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=820.88s)]
*  As he's got the fifth foul, which is another thing at that five minute mark. Right. The [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=824.72s)]
*  Cinderella. What if they're in like TJ went right at him on the next possession? I'm like, if he [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=828.88s)]
*  fouls out like this has been four guys on the Thunder all looking to get the ball back to SGA [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=832.96s)]
*  for about an hour and a half here. So like, what's that going to look like? In a real weird part of [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=838.56s)]
*  me was like almost rooting for SGA to foul out. Just be like, all right, here we go. Like Haliburt's [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=844.4s)]
*  out as Jay's out. Like, let's see what happens here. But yeah, I don't always love the it was [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=848.64s)]
*  kind of Mission Impossible line that I had where like when the eighth one comes out, you can't say [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=857.12s)]
*  this the third best one ever. You have to say that it's the best Mission Impossible. Nobody's going [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=860.96s)]
*  to do that and have it be in the ad. And no one can just win a championship without the follow up [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=866.16s)]
*  questions of like, how real is this? And a lot of times it's total bullshit. It's a waste of time. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=870.8s)]
*  It's a Monday topic after championship. It's not good enough to just celebrate the championship. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=874.88s)]
*  But as Zach said, considering what they've done, how they've built this, how young this team is, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=879.76s)]
*  what the youngest team in 40 plus years, we're in a championship like this. And even with a couple [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=885.12s)]
*  warts, you know, that their defense seems to solve, and we can say now solves enough for them to win [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=889.68s)]
*  a championship. It's totally reasonable to look at them and go, all right, you know, of all the [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=895.04s)]
*  teams in the West, I know we'll get to the East later, because Sixers fans must just be like, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=900.16s)]
*  all right, is this the year? There's no reason to think any of that stuff. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=904.32s)]
*  Normally that post championship discussion, I just think is so fatiguing. And this one is completely [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=909.84s)]
*  relevant. Well, can you imagine if they had ended up with Philly's pick? If they had the seventh pick [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=916.0s)]
*  with all the ace Bailey drama right now, like, are they gonna fucking get ace Bailey? Is that where [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=921.84s)]
*  we're headed with this? I mean, that seventh pick, especially I know Rossella has been grinding tape, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=926.8000000000001s)]
*  I think even our guys, Zach Lowe's been grinding a little bit. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=932.32s)]
*  Grinding grinding grinding is strong. Whatever is like a little soft sanding. Yeah. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=935.5200000000001s)]
*  And they're sanding. Yeah. But that seventh pick is, you know, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=940.0s)]
*  you might really get a dude there. So maybe that's the one silver lining with this. Okay. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=943.9200000000001s)]
*  See piece. Zach, one thing I liked about them today, I thought, you know, Jalen Williams was [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=948.24s)]
*  bad in the first half, but really came on second half. SGA was great the whole game. I really liked [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=952.88s)]
*  everything he did today. And then Chet was great. You know, you win the title, you want your best [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=957.84s)]
*  guys to have a good game in the biggest, biggest stage. I do think we're going to have a complicated [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=963.04s)]
*  relationship with this as a game seven though, because you think back to all the game sevens [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=968.0s)]
*  from the past and the first thing that jumps to your mind with each one, like 2016, LeBron, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=972.64s)]
*  the block, Kyrie shot, and you just go through and it's in this one, you, you're probably going to [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=978.16s)]
*  think about Hal Bern first and then probably SGA second. What else, what else would be the takeaways [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=982.64s)]
*  other than that? Well, SGA, you know, greatest eight of 27 shooting game of all time. Like it's [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=987.6s)]
*  snuck up on me how bad he shot from the floor, but he made a shot for the last 40 minutes, right? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=993.68s)]
*  But 11 free throws, 12 assists, one of the best passing games of his career. Yeah. Jay Dub, like [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=999.84s)]
*  you said, recovered from a shaky first half, pretty dominant second half and Chet was just everywhere [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1005.28s)]
*  defensively and just their wealth of defensive talent when they don't play Joe [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1010.16s)]
*  at all. It's like, what am I even supposed to do against this team? It's just what like that guy [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1014.48s)]
*  made all defense, that guy made all defense. Those four would have had they been eligible, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1019.28s)]
*  but they didn't play enough games. Like, what am I supposed to do? And that's like the ultimate [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1023.04s)]
*  tribute to this team is the one thing that's consistent game in and game out is the puzzle [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1027.84s)]
*  that no team could solve four times in seven games is Oklahoma city's defense. No team was able to [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1031.84s)]
*  solve it. Maybe the Pacers, you know, who knows what happens if Hal Burton doesn't get hurt? Do [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1036.24s)]
*  they put up a better fight? Obviously, but like this is a tribute to how good the defense was [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1040.56s)]
*  with 11 22 left in the game. Shay had a step back three 84 68. I wrote in my notes, zero test by [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1045.44s)]
*  that and which by which I mean, could they not score the rest of the game and still win? Is, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1055.1200000000001s)]
*  is Indiana even going to get to 84? And they did get to 84. They got to 91. But like, I actually [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1061.6000000000001s)]
*  thought, could the Pacers pitch a shutout for 11 minutes and 22 seconds and still not win the game? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1066.96s)]
*  Well, what was it? They had that stretch where TJ was the only guy that scored for [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1073.3600000000001s)]
*  was like 10 plus minutes of the game. And it's and like Pascal, like, I just, it shows you how [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1078.3200000000002s)]
*  great Halliburton is like, he is the straw that serves to drink his combination of the threat to [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1085.84s)]
*  shoot off the dribble from 30 feet, the instant getting off the ball passing the unpredictable [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1091.04s)]
*  movement. It's like, without him, the whole thing, they're not the Pacers. And they were they they [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1096.08s)]
*  did enough to stay in the game for a half, but they just, their backup plan just wasn't there. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1101.6s)]
*  The separation that Siakam thrives on all the gaps, he sort of darts through and they open up, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1106.1599999999999s)]
*  they don't open up without Halliburton. Yes, the outcome hit that three, right? So there was that [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1110.64s)]
*  weird near shot clock violation three, the Dort hits. And it's ridiculous. All right. And it was [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1116.0s)]
*  off another one of these kind of like messy, just get it back to SGA. Like there were a lot of [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1122.64s)]
*  offensive possessions here for OKC, or I was like, do the other four guys have zero interest in [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1127.2s)]
*  doing anything and just hoping SGA figures out. So I think I'm with both of you guys that if you [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1131.44s)]
*  look back at the box score on this one and be like, SGA didn't really have that great of a game seven [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1135.8400000000001s)]
*  shoot. It's like, yeah, but he's dictating everything. It's like a bad Steph Curry shooting game [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1139.36s)]
*  where you're like, OK, but he's still so important, everything that's happening. And I do think there [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1143.36s)]
*  was an adjustment and his willing to pass because only had two assists in game six. So Siakam comes [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1147.1999999999998s)]
*  right back and hits that three, I think about 1030 left in the third quarter. And at the time, I'm [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1152.3999999999999s)]
*  like, if the Pacers pull this off, like I wrote it down, it was like, this will be such a monstrous [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1157.36s)]
*  three because Dort shouldn't have hit that one. It just goes in from that 1030 moment on, even [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1161.76s)]
*  though TJ is just dicing everybody up because even in game seven, the secondary defenders still [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1167.04s)]
*  weren't ready for this TJ McConnell fucking show. It's unbelievable what he did. He scores all those [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1172.08s)]
*  points in a row. Siakam did not take another shot in the third quarter until that thing at the very [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1177.92s)]
*  end with five seconds left. Now he did sit for five minutes. So then when I thought, OK, he got that [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1182.24s)]
*  rest, he wasn't a big part of the offense because everybody's kind of watching TJ go off. I was [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1186.56s)]
*  expecting him to try to get that push. And very early in the fourth quarter, he gets a possession [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1190.3999999999999s)]
*  and you can see that he wants to be aggressive. It's not him checking out, it's him not, you know, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1195.92s)]
*  like being afraid of the moment. It wasn't any of those things, but he gets into this position [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1200.48s)]
*  where Chet comes over, just swallows him up. And Siakam twice had these two early positions [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1205.52s)]
*  in the fourth quarter where he's like, this is to Zach's point, like, oh shit, like everybody's [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1210.6399999999999s)]
*  paying attention to me now and I'm not going to be able to just cut off Halliburton dicing everybody [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1217.04s)]
*  up and just breaking the paint. Well, that was the fun part about that McConnell stretch [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1222.24s)]
*  when he scored all those points. But I think he also had at least four turnovers and they were [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1227.76s)]
*  just like, if you ever wanted your answer on, could McConnell be Jaylen Brunson on the Knicks? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1232.32s)]
*  If you geared your offense around him, we're throwing everything we have at stopping him. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1237.6s)]
*  I think he had the two turnovers in a row and hit the three threes when they blew it up and all of [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1241.84s)]
*  a sudden they're up nine and they were just coming at him, coming at him. And it was like, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1245.92s)]
*  oh man, the clock struck midnight for poor TJ McConnell. And then he scored 10 straight points. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1250.48s)]
*  He was like, no, I'm just going to go to the basket over and over again. And was just fighting these [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1255.76s)]
*  guys off by himself. But yeah, I thought the thing they miss, I mean, on top of all the other stuff [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1259.84s)]
*  you missed with Halliburton, they just don't get fast breaks without them. They couldn't push the [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1264.72s)]
*  pace at all. And if it's going to be a half court game, okay, so he's beating anyone except maybe [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1270.8s)]
*  Denver if we're just going half court versus half court. And that's how Denver was able to [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1275.84s)]
*  hang with him. What else do we need to talk about? Okay. See why Zach, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1280.8s)]
*  is there a way for them to get better in your opinion? Oh, absolutely. What would be your [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1285.36s)]
*  number one move? Well, I think, I mean, you know, the talking points are always, well, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1289.6s)]
*  Chet's just scratching the surface of what he can be offensively. And you know, he did not shoot [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1295.12s)]
*  the three, maybe one or two from three today, did not shoot the three well in the playoffs again. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1298.72s)]
*  And Jaydub still has levels to get to as the second and third guys. I think just along with that, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1303.1200000000001s)]
*  those guys getting better offensively comes a, they still have like molding of a general offensive [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1309.6s)]
*  system to do that doesn't default all the time to just like, Shay, can you do something at the end [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1316.64s)]
*  of the clock? And I think that's what Ryan was talking about earlier of like just the dependence [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1322.0s)]
*  on his one-on-one game, the synergy between Shay and Jaydub, you know, we saw them run a few pick [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1325.68s)]
*  and rolls in this game, like they did at the end of game five, I think it was when they cracked [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1330.48s)]
*  the defense a little bit with that. I just think like just building out the offense is the thing [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1336.72s)]
*  that would scare me about the Thunder if I were all these other teams in the West trying to load [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1342.64s)]
*  up and compete with them is that they still have as a collective levels to get to. But look, I mean, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1346.56s)]
*  the Halliburton thing is also a reminder that even, I mean, the Thunder are probably going to be the [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1352.08s)]
*  exception given how well they are set up now and later, but like none of this stuff is guaranteed. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1356.72s)]
*  That's what's heartbreaking about this Halliburton injury. Like it's not like when was the last time [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1362.56s)]
*  the Pacers were in the finals? There's no guarantee they'll be back at this stage ever in Tyrese [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1366.48s)]
*  Halliburton's career. Like none of this is guaranteed to you, not even to the Thunder. And [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1371.04s)]
*  that's why getting all the way here after all this grueling stuff and having an MA just sucks. Like [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1375.1200000000001s)]
*  it just objectively sucks. I would also add like I'm happy for Presti because it was always the [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1380.24s)]
*  annoying guy. And I'm using that as just the catch all annoying guy of like, oh, if he's so good, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1388.56s)]
*  you know, dot, dot, dot. And you're just like, shut the fuck up. Okay. And to think of what Zach's [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1395.28s)]
*  talking about with Halliburton, like I thought about it too. It's like, what's the likelihood [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1402.4s)]
*  Halliburton gets back to the NBA finals? Like it's, it's far more unlikely than likely just the way [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1405.52s)]
*  this stuff plays out. And if you're a Thunder fan and it's not like I have this decades long, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1410.16s)]
*  like sympathy for Thunder fans, the way you would maybe say like the Cleveland Browns or something, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1415.6000000000001s)]
*  but for that group to have Katie Westbrook, Harden, Serge, and make it to the NBA finals in 2012 [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1420.88s)]
*  and feel like they were competitive, right? Even though it was a five game series. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1428.48s)]
*  And you're kind of leaving there going, all right, you know, we got some of that playoff seasoning [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1433.44s)]
*  and we're good. And imagine like telling anybody, imagine telling Preston, be like the next time you [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1437.2s)]
*  guys are going to be here in 13 years. So it's, it's an amazing rehabilitation. Yeah. I was, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1441.04s)]
*  when they were watching, watching everybody hug and celebrate and print, they showed Preston hugging [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1448.96s)]
*  SGA. And you think back to that summer when Ryan and I were doing pots together that summer. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1453.8400000000001s)]
*  And all the focus was on the Quippers traded a man. Okay. So he did well for themselves because [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1460.32s)]
*  they had hit a dead end. The Westbrook era was done. This, this, that, that was it. There was [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1464.24s)]
*  no chance to win a title with Westbrook and Paul George and whoever else they had. And to be able [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1469.92s)]
*  to parlay that into what they did with weirdly an umbilical cord to that 2012 finals that Ryan's [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1476.0s)]
*  mentioning, where it does feel like it's somehow connected to that era because they took that era [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1483.04s)]
*  as far as they could. And then they turned all the assets into a, the rest of it. I do want to [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1490.8s)]
*  point out they did. I mean, did you feel like this was okay. See his first title or their second, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1495.12s)]
*  Zach, just the, just the question. I don't get the question. Okay. See when the title today, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1500.1599999999999s)]
*  is it their first title? Is it their second title? I'm not going to wait into these. No, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1507.6s)]
*  no, you're waiting in the question. You have to answer. It's their first NBA championship. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1511.52s)]
*  Okay. There we go. This is my Minneapolis Lakers case or so. But does anyone, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1516.0s)]
*  nobody, nobody know kissing the fans are like, we got our second one. No, but this one, no one's [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1520.24s)]
*  fighting with you on this one, right? Yeah, but this is the Minneapolis Laker point. They still [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1525.6s)]
*  claim the five Minneapolis Lakers title. Sorry. Whatever. Uh, Jack sick with seventh and MVP [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1529.92s)]
*  voting that year. Uh, this special portion of the bill Simmons podcast is being brought to you by [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1534.72s)]
*  loom by Atlassian and you're feeling stuck at work. They can help you trade out lengthy emails [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1541.2s)]
*  and unproductive meetings for something better looms video messaging with it. You can record [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1546.56s)]
*  your screen, you and your voice to share messages easily. You say you can save time and still say [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1551.84s)]
*  connected share, quick update, provide feedback, train a colleague, everything in between. Try [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1557.28s)]
*  loom today at loom.com that is L O M.com. Um, can, can we fast forward to how weird the East is next [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1561.36s)]
*  year and then circle back and talk about the finals? I don't know how long Zach's staying [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1570.24s)]
*  because he's on East coast time. I'm glad we have to talk about this. No, but I'm glad you're doing [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1574.0s)]
*  it this way because I'm this, I just want to say this before we go forward. I'm glad we're doing [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1578.8s)]
*  this right after the heat of the moment and after the trophy presentation, because it's going to go [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1584.32s)]
*  down as a weird podcast. Like we, and it's weird because we don't know how to talk about the gig. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1590.88s)]
*  Like what you said before about, I was just in a haze for like an hour after Halliburton got hurt. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1596.56s)]
*  So this should be a strange podcast that jumps from like, Hey, are the who's favored in the East [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1602.8s)]
*  next year with all these injuries to what do we think about the thunder's legacy as a champion to [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1608.96s)]
*  poor Tyrese Halliburton? Because it just, it's a hard, it's just a strange moment to be, to talk [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1613.52s)]
*  about. So I'm glad we're getting strange. Let's talk about the freaking East next year. Yeah. So, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1618.72s)]
*  so two pieces, the first piece is the Halliburton piece, um, out for next year. No question. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1623.6s)]
*  Heartbreaking. Uh, I was so bummed out. Like I just couldn't believe it. I like it. Cause you [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1630.48s)]
*  knew right away, it feels like we've seen enough of these that as soon as you saw the calf shimmy, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1637.28s)]
*  you're like, Oh my God, I'm really, this is happening. Um, for him, he just went through [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1641.92s)]
*  this whole eight, nine month thing where he went from basketball fans and knew who he was. Wasn't [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1649.2s)]
*  really a household name to like, I felt like he became a legitimate star. He became the face of [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1656.16s)]
*  a team that we all loved. Even if you weren't a Pacers fan, you have your own thing. Like this [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1661.0400000000002s)]
*  was the front man of a team that I think was the biggest winner of this entire NBA playoffs that [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1665.6000000000001s)]
*  didn't win the title. And now he's just gone. We have no idea when he's going to be. It'll be 18 [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1671.0400000000002s)]
*  months before we see him play basketball again. And I just can't believe this is how this worked [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1676.0800000000002s)]
*  out. Where you have somebody who's it's like watching some, like a summer movie where they're [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1681.6s)]
*  promoting this movie coming, this movie coming. So this is so and so it's like, Oh man, this guy's [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1687.6s)]
*  the new Superman is going to be a big star. And then that's it. We just don't see him. I just can't [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1691.68s)]
*  believe this is how it happened. Yeah. Cause I couldn't even start thinking about the East until [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1696.16s)]
*  like halftime. Cause then it crept into my head and I knew we probably should have to do some of [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1701.84s)]
*  this. Cause yeah, I think all three of us for like, you know, it's not like we're a thunder podcast, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1706.24s)]
*  you know, sometimes like I think of the sports center rules, the arguments I would get into the [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1711.04s)]
*  radio show back in the day of like, well, this team won. It's like, so what are we supposed to [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1714.48s)]
*  do? Just say they were awesome for seven minutes. Like what's the actual topic? And we've gone, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1718.72s)]
*  we've all at our own podcast. We've all talked about all the reasons that are awesome. I mean, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1722.8s)]
*  the East was weird before this Halbert and injury. We were like, what's going to happen with the East [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1727.6s)]
*  next year? We had no idea. Now it's three times weirder. Well, maybe I could guess that Zach, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1731.76s)]
*  the GM you were talking to wasn't Covey Altman. If he was like, this gives us hope [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1736.56s)]
*  because it felt like a team, a team that didn't have high end talent. And after [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1740.32s)]
*  Charlottesville gets eliminated, you excited for the potential Lamello ball, Jalen Green back [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1745.36s)]
*  court down the line. Yeah. The bell, con canipple. Yeah, let's go. Canipple and Jalen Green work [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1751.52s)]
*  together. I don't know. But if you're looking at everything that we said in the moment with [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1758.08s)]
*  Cleveland, you're like another disappointing early exit, incredible regular season profile. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1763.84s)]
*  Clearly Garland is even more hurt than we realize because I miss time and next season. But I would [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1768.24s)]
*  always talk with you about it and be like, you know, most of the GMs are just going to go, hey, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1774.56s)]
*  we really like our four guys. We spent a ton of money on the fifth guy and Hunter. We added [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1777.92s)]
*  shooting and all these different things. I mean, Ty Jerome's probably gone, but we'll probably just [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1782.64s)]
*  run it back even if we seem a little flawed. And it's embarrassing that we lost that series of the [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1787.2s)]
*  Pacers even with the Garland injury. Now, if you're Cleveland, you're just going, well, of course, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1792.08s)]
*  we're running it back now. Yeah, we're you afraid of Tatum's out. Halliburton's out and the Knicks [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1796.32s)]
*  just had a coaching change and God only knows what's going to happen with them. Dames out. Does [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1801.36s)]
*  that even I mean, if you think that, yeah, it's part of it. Yeah, that's definitely 100% part of [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1805.04s)]
*  it. And Orlando, who does the main trade. And now they're like, Jesus, did you see the Orlando [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1809.04s)]
*  odds went from 30 to one to win the title to 12 to one after the injury? Come on. Yeah. Well, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1814.48s)]
*  this is one of my this is one of my subplots that I talked about last week is like, and it's even [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1823.04s)]
*  more relevant now. Is there another Bain style move coming for like a random team? Not that [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1828.96s)]
*  Orlando was a random team. I thought Orlando would have been a 50 win team this year had they stayed [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1835.2s)]
*  healthy. So they're they're above that. But like, are the Hawks going to be like, hey, you know what, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1838.8799999999999s)]
*  how many picks we got? Like, can we go? Can we go get I don't even know who it would be. Can we [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1843.76s)]
*  go get this guy? That guy? Like, like, why not? Do you want to do some Hawks trade exception talk? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1847.36s)]
*  Oh, my God, because it's like 25 million. Yeah, they could fit Dylan Brooks right now. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1852.8s)]
*  We'll take them. Think bigger. I don't know. No, I'm just I think smaller when it comes to trade [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1857.44s)]
*  exceptions. That was some free agency thing the other day. And it's like, oh, it's like, okay, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1864.64s)]
*  right. So the $25 million player has to be another guy that costs that much. The other team doesn't [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1871.68s)]
*  want anything back for a value. I'm ashamed to admit the only insurance. The only reason I know [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1875.76s)]
*  about that trade exception is I was looking at three way deals with Drew going to Phoenix [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1882.24s)]
*  and Dylan Brooks going Atlanta and the Celtics getting Royce O'Neal and saving like $23 million. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1888.16s)]
*  I did. I just I gave it a test drive on the on the trade machine. I'm not saying it's a trade that [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1894.0s)]
*  could happen, but I was trying to trying to figure out some because I mean, I mean, I probably should [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1898.88s)]
*  make a screenshot and put it on Instagram. But yeah, if you're if you're Cleveland, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1905.28s)]
*  you have like a legitimately embarrassing loss. You win 64 games and you just go out. You get [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1910.16s)]
*  basically sucker punched in round two. And then after that happens, Tatum, as that's happening, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1917.12s)]
*  Tatum goes down. Halbert goes down and the next got only we still don't know who their coaches. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1923.36s)]
*  So you're saying calves 73 and nine next year? I think the calves are like, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1930.56s)]
*  you know, let's let's run. And then Orlando, I think, is feeling good. And then I think you [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1934.6399999999999s)]
*  guys are right. Like, there's going to be some wild card East team. We've had some fun trades [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1940.1599999999999s)]
*  where teams who weren't in it were like, maybe we're maybe we're a contender and they'll just [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1945.2s)]
*  do something crazy. I'm on the plane. Bulls. Yeah, they start calling up trade. What's going on with [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1950.1599999999999s)]
*  Julius Randall and you guys? Hey, look, man, Toronto, Toronto took Jakob Pertle off the table [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1956.3999999999999s)]
*  for Kevin Durant. Like, I don't I don't know if I don't maybe Toronto is not our candidate for a [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1962.88s)]
*  wild trade. If you're taking Jakob Pertle off the table and Kevin Durant trade talks, it's, you know, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1966.8000000000002s)]
*  maybe maybe real. That was real. Yeah, it's a real thing that happened. It was the Miami thing [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1970.88s)]
*  real that Sean said, because that like that Haywood and Highsmith and what you call it, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1975.6000000000001s)]
*  Yovich weren't no. Yeah, that one was Sean's with Miami was no one was available. Tell me, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1980.0800000000002s)]
*  tell me what he said. I didn't see it. He's basically saying like they were like, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1986.0800000000002s)]
*  we'll give you Wiggins and a contract and the 20th pick like they basically offered nothing. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1989.2s)]
*  Sounds like somebody's a little anti-podal. I like Jakob Pertle just fine. I'm just like, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=1996.88s)]
*  like if you are like, could you do you want Kevin Durant or not? Like, yeah, like you got to trade [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2002.8s)]
*  something to get some phone with whoever's taking calls for the sons. If Jakob Pertle who I were [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2008.0s)]
*  what is he the 16th best starting center in the NBA 12th, 9th, 18th? I don't know. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2014.4s)]
*  I'd certainly would not take them off the table for anyone who averaged over 20 points a game [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2020.72s)]
*  last year, much less 25, 26, 27. Yeah. So he ended up going to Houston. We're going to talk [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2025.1200000000001s)]
*  about that later. But yeah. So Cleveland, Orlando, I mean, and then you look at the Pacers, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2031.2s)]
*  they have this magical run. It's amazing. And now, you know, no Halbert next year. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2036.8s)]
*  Not a lot of ways. Detroit 58 wins next year for the Pistons. I mean, I've been coming back [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2044.08s)]
*  well, Ron Holland year two. Are there our guy, is there anyone else now that the rants off the [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2051.7599999999998s)]
*  table that you feel like is a elevator for a team like Detroit, for instance? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2059.68s)]
*  Very, we've already had Bain and Durant traded. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2066.8s)]
*  I'm looking at the standings. I mean, it's it's it's going to be hard to find [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2073.2000000000003s)]
*  a team that's like motivated to sell. Let's call it like the Jeremy Grant line, a team that's [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2080.4s)]
*  motivated to sell a player that's better than Jeremy Grant. Like I think we all agree, Jeremy [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2086.8s)]
*  Grant's a nice NBA player from a team that might at some point want to pivot away from him, but also [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2090.6400000000003s)]
*  not a guy who you're going to be like, whoa, they got that guy. That changes my whole thinking [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2095.36s)]
*  about the team. And the Memphis guys seem to be somewhat off the table. I think your best [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2100.08s)]
*  candidate would be Markanin, right? Like just like if they decide just this, this is John Collins, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2106.48s)]
*  is Collins above or below the Jeremy Grant line below? I don't mind them. I think it's an expiring [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2112.08s)]
*  contract, too. But the grant thing, you're taking on some real money. That's like over [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2118.7200000000003s)]
*  90 billion. So I'm not I'm not as excited for that. I know for solo as a GM, he would have [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2123.76s)]
*  he would have already scouted all the eight and post ups from last year. Try to try to talk yourself [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2130.0800000000004s)]
*  into it. The other place to look is like, like the Rosen to me doesn't doesn't do it. But the [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2135.04s)]
*  Levine like is there any big Zach Levine fan like this guy's changing? Is he above the Jeremy [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2140.1600000000003s)]
*  Grant line? I think he probably is. But I think he is not by as much as is his sort of raw stats, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2145.6800000000003s)]
*  which suggests I don't think. Well, he's playing for his number one fan right now in the back. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2151.12s)]
*  For solo, how far below the Jeremy Grant line do you have Bradley Beale? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2156.0s)]
*  Is it is it like you go into the basement and then there's a special freight elevator where you have [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2161.52s)]
*  to go another it's like nobody knows about the elevator. Then you go another three floors down. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2166.64s)]
*  If I could do Beale for Grant, I'd make a grant statue. If you're if you're feeding price. Yeah, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2170.96s)]
*  you don't even have to play. And then he would veto it after you made the trade. Yeah. I'm so, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2177.36s)]
*  you know, one of the reasons is that the rent rate happened was because the draft is somehow [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2185.84s)]
*  three days from now. So on a Wednesday night, we just had a game seven. It's that we have a [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2189.76s)]
*  72 hour. And so Phoenix wanted that 10th pick. I still feel like Dallas has Dallas is the one [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2194.4s)]
*  I'm watching because I just don't think the roster that they have is going to be the roster they [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2201.04s)]
*  start October with. And I don't know whether it's going to be Gafford or Clay or PJ Washington or [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2204.72s)]
*  what they do, but I just feel like there's some sort of move with them. And I think Gafford would [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2209.04s)]
*  have real value. But but I'm talking about like that's not catapulting. That's below the that's [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2214.16s)]
*  below the Jeremy Grant line. But I think Dallas is the most likely trade. And then I think Sacramento [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2220.3199999999997s)]
*  is going to be on the edge of my seat waiting to see what they do. Can I didn't think we were going [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2225.8399999999997s)]
*  to do a Gafford Grant debate, but I mean, Gafford probably needs more for certain. Definitely. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2229.52s)]
*  Grant would, because as talented as Grant is, he also can be a little Tobias heresy. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2234.4799999999996s)]
*  Look, I just want to apologize to the listeners. We're all just part of my basketball soul just [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2242.9599999999996s)]
*  evaporated during the time. That's the thing. Well heard. And now my brain is broken. And I'm [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2249.6s)]
*  going to say a following the following sentence out loud on a podcast an hour after the Thunder [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2254.56s)]
*  won the championship. Does anyone know what's going on with Zion Williamson? If we're talking [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2259.6s)]
*  about the Jeremy Grant line and tradeable guys? Like is he do the Pelicans want him? Joe, Joe [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2264.96s)]
*  Dumars is somehow now the GM of the Pelicans. Do like, do we know what's happening there? Because [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2271.12s)]
*  I guess that's another name. We should at least be like that guy could change. If he ever actually [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2276.48s)]
*  played, he could change some change some themes. Well, we're still is our number one Zion expert. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2280.56s)]
*  I know he's been monitoring it. Yeah, I still think ownership really likes the idea of him [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2285.68s)]
*  there. And they feel burned historically with other big names asking out and having great [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2292.56s)]
*  stories. But you know, again, I don't know that because Baron Davis is good after I'd be like, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2299.9199999999996s)]
*  we have to keep Zion. I personally would just be like, Hey, it's, it's time to move on from this, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2306.0s)]
*  even though I think all of us when it's good, we love watching it. I've referenced that Minnesota [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2310.0s)]
*  regular season game when he was back and he was spry and ready to go. And I was like, this is a [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2314.88s)]
*  fun, fun game. But there's also like a basketball question with Zion, because the best the best [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2319.04s)]
*  version of him is when he's your point card. And you just let him go point Zion, and he kills [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2323.44s)]
*  everybody. No one can stay in front of them. And the funny thing is like, he's play off of them, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2328.0s)]
*  because he can't shoot. And that's normally you do against somebody who's a penetrator. But you [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2332.32s)]
*  actually are allowing him to get a running start. So it kind of backfires. So you have to close out [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2336.88s)]
*  somebody who can't shoot and then I've always kind of liked his passing. But yeah, look, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2341.76s)]
*  if he were healthy, we could probably have this conversation about him. But I do think that there's [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2347.28s)]
*  a fair conversation about like what he would actually bring to an already established team. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2350.88s)]
*  If it's we just got to clear out and let him go a much taller, more athletic version of TJ [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2355.1200000000003s)]
*  McConnell, like as great as TJ McConnell has been throughout the series. I didn't think I'd ever see [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2361.0400000000004s)]
*  five out TJ McConnell just beating up on a defense player in the restricted area and a team being [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2366.16s)]
*  like, this is how we want to run our office. Like, this is our identity. What Zach, if you had to [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2372.24s)]
*  make a documentary about anything about the 2025 finals with just a TJ, just trying to trying to [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2378.3999999999996s)]
*  figure out how this guy was attacking one of the best defenses we've seen in the last 40 years and [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2386.24s)]
*  getting shots that he wanted, just trying to understand that. That's like a two hour doc. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2391.76s)]
*  Apologies to listeners again, but there was like two and a half years ago, he would not shoot. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2398.4s)]
*  He did not want to shoot. And then sometime last season, I don't know if he flipped a switch in [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2405.6000000000004s)]
*  his head, if Rick Carlisle flipped a switch in his head, he was like, I'm going to go get me some [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2410.6400000000003s)]
*  buckets and I'm like going to be an elite isolate. Forget picks. I don't even need picks. I'm just [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2415.2000000000003s)]
*  going to isolate like I'm a six, eight wing and I'm going to get buckets on fucking everybody off [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2420.16s)]
*  the bench and play my way into the six man of the year conversation. I've never seen a transformation [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2425.2799999999997s)]
*  like it. The thunder just won the NBA championship by the way. So, so Lou Dort would be the only, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2429.7599999999998s)]
*  well, Lou Dort would be the only thing if they had to like, try to save money with extensions. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2437.52s)]
*  That's the only move. And I just wouldn't trade him. He's beloved. He's beloved. No, he's beloved. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2441.8399999999997s)]
*  And I'll tell you this about Lou, but he's also too important on what they do. I just, to me, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2447.2s)]
*  it's a non-starter. You know what we can say about Lou freaking Dort. You can say a lot of things [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2451.2s)]
*  about Lou freaking Dort, but you could never say he will stop shooting threes if he goes into a [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2454.96s)]
*  slump. That dude is going to keep on shooting contested three after contested three, right? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2460.16s)]
*  And he doesn't care if he's missed six and he shoots with the conscience of like clay Thompson, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2465.7599999999998s)]
*  just like, of course I'm going to make like the next seven that I take. I love it. It's weird. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2470.96s)]
*  I always thought they're going in. You do. I do. I don't know why. I just [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2475.6s)]
*  something about him. He's got a very specific launch angle where there's some where you go, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2481.8399999999997s)]
*  Whoa, Whoa, like this is he is playing this one up. I did have a list of to-dos for the Thunder. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2486.08s)]
*  Had they blown this, which I wrote some of that stuff down first. One of the reasons they can't [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2492.16s)]
*  get rid of Lou Dort, even though it's been suggested if they want to get really clever [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2497.2799999999997s)]
*  and constantly stay in front of this and allow themselves a financial flexibility, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2501.68s)]
*  I would be afraid to see what the personality of this team is without Lou Dort. Yes. Okay. Because [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2505.6s)]
*  every team needs a badass and he's still kind of a quiet badass. He's not an outward emotional guy. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2510.56s)]
*  And at the times when I was wondering what the hell's going on with this team, like what's, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2517.44s)]
*  what's wrong with the Thunder right now? And it's like, are they too casual? Are they still [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2521.8399999999997s)]
*  a little too chill? Is that still even something that's fair to say about a team that just won an [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2526.88s)]
*  NBA championship? Because clearly it's not so detrimental that it prevents them reaching the [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2531.12s)]
*  ultimate goal because they just did it an hour ago. But it's part of the Dort conversation [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2535.12s)]
*  because this is, it's like taking Draymond away from Prime, Steph and Clay. As great as those [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2540.48s)]
*  dudes were, you needed somebody who was always on edge. And I think every team needs one of those [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2545.6s)]
*  guys and Chet's certainly not ready to be that guy. I don't even know if that's in his personality. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2550.88s)]
*  Physically, like I'm so excited about Chet when he can actually hold his position. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2555.92s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it's just a nightmare for him trying to hold up, which looked a lot better when the [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2559.7599999999998s)]
*  other team went small tonight, but the Dort thing I think is really interesting because I'm with [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2564.48s)]
*  you. Like you would hear, could they get in front of that? And I think they desperately need his [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2569.12s)]
*  personality. Yeah, because he's the reason you do it is I think he's up to like 20 million a year. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2574.56s)]
*  And you could just, you have guys on your bench that are cheaper replacements. That's it. That [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2579.84s)]
*  would be the only reason. But Zach and I went to game four and in the second half of that game, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2583.28s)]
*  I thought he was the MVP of the game, him and Caruso. They just took the game over with their [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2589.2s)]
*  you know, by, by just being like alphas on defense and like a really specific way, [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2594.32s)]
*  like the way they carried themselves to what, what they try to do to Halburn. I mean, one of the [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2600.32s)]
*  complaints I had about this series was there was very little bad blood, shit talking, anything, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2604.4s)]
*  all the stuff that we're just used to in a final. It was a very polite series. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2610.32s)]
*  And that I thought the second half of game four was the only one when they [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2615.6800000000003s)]
*  really ramped it up where it felt like a little more, a little more personal. I don't know, Zach. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2619.92s)]
*  So if they keep him, then you have all these young guys on the team. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2626.16s)]
*  I guess it is what it is. It seems great. Yeah. I was going to say we can, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2632.32s)]
*  we can pitch. There might be some topage minutes somewhere, maybe some garbage time stuff. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2636.08s)]
*  Well, they have, they have how they change. They have 15 contracts next year, like 13 [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2640.0s)]
*  guaranteed contracts. And then AJ Mitchell and big Jalen Williams are team options. That's 15 [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2646.24s)]
*  dudes. That's all you can have on an NBA roster. I think the guy to look at for like, how do they [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2652.08s)]
*  re reorient the roster a little bit to just not be a second apron team and just get crushed by [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2658.56s)]
*  the luxury tax more so than Dort is heart and Steen's player team option rather for 28 and a [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2664.24s)]
*  half million and 26, 27, maybe, you know, I I'm not saying they would decline that. I just think [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2670.16s)]
*  that's I'm sure that some part of their brain is like, it would be really great if two years from [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2675.84s)]
*  now he was not super essential to our, the Chet had ascended and the rest of our team had ascended [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2682.08s)]
*  where it's not like super essential to pay another center this much money. Well, that's like a schedule [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2687.68s)]
*  and I bet Dort would take a decent like team friendly deal too when it comes to him. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2694.08s)]
*  The heart, the Hartenstein signing felt like the cap scheduling signing that we see a lot of teams [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2698.24s)]
*  do where it's like before we have to extend all of these guys, let's just use the space now, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2704.08s)]
*  add the asset. You got to have the owner sign off on it. But I mean, he's a, he's a really big story [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2708.0s)]
*  and remember last year, their fatal flaw felt like the rebounding, the rebounding rate numbers [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2714.0s)]
*  were atrocious. They weren't great this year. They weren't very good at all in the playoffs, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2718.08s)]
*  but he wasn't very good in the finals. No, I really think he, he became, you know, [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2724.64s)]
*  they ran the first two plays for him where game six, it was a hard role and then they did the same [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2730.0s)]
*  thing tonight, but they weren't able to get it to them. And sometimes when I see that kind of stuff, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2735.6s)]
*  it's like they want to set the tone to have him be a little bit more engaged offensively. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2739.6s)]
*  And even his passing is really good, but you know, it's one thing when you're running your regular [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2743.6s)]
*  season offense through him 30 feet away from the hoop and he's trying to pass it over the top of [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2748.0s)]
*  defenders. If you, if you caught up in some sort of scramble, but you could see diagonal with just [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2751.52s)]
*  trying to go away from him. You know, I mean, he started a series of them on the bench, you know, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2756.72s)]
*  so yeah, it's a really expensive luxury to have for a team that's going to have to pay a ton of [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2761.68s)]
*  other guys. So that special portion of today's episode where we looked at the Easter conference [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2766.24s)]
*  was brought to you by loom by at last hand with video messaging from loom. You can trade out these [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2770.96s)]
*  novel length emails and back to back calls. And finally stop feeling stuck at work, simply record [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2776.08s)]
*  whenever you need to share with your team, no video production or editing skills are needed. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2779.92s)]
*  It has easy to use skills and AI features to help you make it exactly what you want. Get them back [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2783.6s)]
*  on track. Try loom today at loom.com that is L O M dot com. Uh, Zach, I don't know how long you're [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2788.56s)]
*  staying, but we got to talk to SGA really fast here because he is the first, uh, since shack 2000 [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2794.56s)]
*  scoring title MVP finals, MVP. And, uh, I, the problem with, with SJ is there's not a lot of [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2802.4s)]
*  controversy with him. There's not a lot to say there's no zags. He's just scoring 30, 32 a game. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2811.84s)]
*  Sometimes it can get a little one-dimensional, but I feel like that's probably the fault of his team. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2817.84s)]
*  Like we're so laid out earlier. Uh, his assist stuff was really good today, which is a theme [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2822.32s)]
*  that we've seen in the, as we get, especially these finals games that happened with Tatum last [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2827.1200000000003s)]
*  year where the unselfishness really comes out as like a strategy, but is there another level for him [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2831.44s)]
*  to go to or is this it? No, I mean, look, it's hard to have another level from MVP, uh, in a year [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2837.76s)]
*  where, in a year where Jokic had the year that he had and you still want MVP and it wasn't like an [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2844.1600000000003s)]
*  outrage. Um, uh, I think he stepped up his three point volume this year. And if you could marry [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2849.36s)]
*  that with some better three point efficiency, he'll continue to grow as a playmaker. I like the [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2855.76s)]
*  stuff they were doing out of time house with him off the ball. We would talk about that on podcasts [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2860.88s)]
*  where he would set back screens like he knew Lee, but there's like, what else are you supposed to [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2864.56s)]
*  do? I do think it's kind of cool. The whole foul grifting thing kind of faded. Like it wasn't a [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2868.16s)]
*  talking point at all in the finals. And I didn't feel like it, it needed to be like it, he wasn't [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2874.48s)]
*  like shamefully going for fouls. And I don't, I think that was always kind of overblown. It was [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2879.52s)]
*  cool that that just vanished as a storyline. Yeah. What do you guys know? No one talks about Nemheart [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2883.12s)]
*  trying to get fouls. Just a little counterpoint there. Uh, decent Zach. Yeah. Not even a Zach on [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2889.84s)]
*  that one. 8.9. It's funny cause Tatum, the Tatum conversation always felt like, Hey, he's really [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2898.96s)]
*  good and he's never going to be the best player in the world and it's okay. And the Celtics were [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2905.28s)]
*  always ahead of schedule playing deep into the playoffs. And then it was like, yeah, but you [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2910.7200000000003s)]
*  actually think they were going to beat some of these teams that used to conference finals. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2915.2000000000003s)]
*  I granted there's, there's a heat or two one in there that you're like, okay, what went, what went [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2917.44s)]
*  wrong there? Uh, especially a couple of years ago, but it felt like Tatum and maybe it was [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2921.76s)]
*  cause of the Olympic stuff where it was like, if this guy is so good, you know, the cool thing for [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2928.56s)]
*  SGA, because it all feels very on schedule with this team, because as you said, which I think [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2933.2000000000003s)]
*  another thing we need to give the Thunder return a credit for is I've heard people talk about them [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2939.52s)]
*  like, Oh, they tanked. They just, they had Chris Paul that one season, they get the game seven of [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2943.92s)]
*  the first round against Houston and then they have two down years and then they're right back into [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2948.7200000000003s)]
*  it to being competitive. This is one of the quickest resets ever. And again, when you nail [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2952.32s)]
*  on the same draft Chet and Jalen Williams to go with the guy who's going to be MVP, like that's, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2957.44s)]
*  it's pretty good. Like a lot of the hard stuff is done on your to-do list and building out a roster. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2962.48s)]
*  So however this team has been around, this isn't like, and this may have led to some of the lack [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2966.7200000000003s)]
*  of interest that it wasn't the best player in the game at a young age trying to finally get over [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2972.08s)]
*  the hump or it wasn't one of the guys who was considered the best player in the game. Like [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2977.84s)]
*  imagine Giannis without a ring being in the NBA finals in 2026. And it's like, man, now maybe [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2981.68s)]
*  with him not being American, that would be a little different, but there seems to be a need [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2988.0s)]
*  for some dramatic buildup. And the funny thing is this all feels very, very on schedule. Like it [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2992.96s)]
*  makes sense that they, I think they still should have beat Dallas last year. They didn't, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=2998.16s)]
*  they house Minnesota. We start to think, okay, this pace thing's probably over, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3003.2s)]
*  ends up being a terrific series. But them winning this in this year, in this form, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3007.2799999999997s)]
*  even though I still want a little bit more from the guys around him, it's just so like, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3012.3199999999997s)]
*  like there's nothing disruptive about it. It's ahead of schedule. It's ahead of schedule. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3018.7999999999997s)]
*  Do you think it's ahead of schedule? I mean, who in the West was supposed to beat him? [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3023.8399999999997s)]
*  Well, I'm just saying the team to your teams don't get this good, this fast with this many [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3027.76s)]
*  young players. And even she's turning 27 in like three weeks. He's still like not like just [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3032.96s)]
*  entering his traditional prime. Yeah. It's basically their second playoff run. So from [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3038.5600000000004s)]
*  that standpoint, just based on how the league works, it's been the best. I would say yes, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3043.44s)]
*  they were the favorites too. Yeah. But based on the competition. Yeah. But it is weird that they [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3048.88s)]
*  didn't have their version of the Steph game in 22, 22 against that Celtics team. Like there's [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3055.36s)]
*  just like the heartbreaking loss. The closest they came to is Shay Fowling, who is it? PJ [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3063.1200000000003s)]
*  Washington in the corner on the three. That was their heartbreaking loss. Usually you have a couple [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3068.08s)]
*  years of those and they just didn't. Flashback to two years ago when Denver wins the title, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3073.6800000000003s)]
*  if you had said who wins the championship next, who wins the championship sooner, the Nuggets [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3078.6400000000003s)]
*  again or the Thunder, we would have all said the Nuggets. Of course, the Thunder, their playing [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3084.16s)]
*  team. It was before the Zeek Nodgie extension. The play in the leap last year. It's fair. It's a fair [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3088.0s)]
*  point. It's before they were crippled by one $8 million extension, completely paralyzed them. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3096.0s)]
*  The play in team to what they were last year is that's the mega leap. I mean, they made another [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3101.68s)]
*  mega leap this year, but that was the one where you saw it coming. I didn't think they would make [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3108.08s)]
*  that leap that fast. That's like a massive, massive jump. Yeah. I remember doing this before [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3111.92s)]
*  two seasons ago, just trying to figure out, was it realistic and looking at history? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3119.36s)]
*  And there were some pretty decent examples, which is why, like if you're Detroit or Orlando, [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3124.64s)]
*  you can look at OKC and be like, hey, it's not as crazy as you think. They were below 500. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3130.08s)]
*  Two seasons ago, they were 40 and 42. Right. But everybody thought that year they're going [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3138.08s)]
*  to have like 20 wins. And so the point you made about how they really only threw away two years, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3143.04s)]
*  it felt like more than two because all the Poku five out offense, just watching that [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3150.64s)]
*  unleagued pass in real time in February, March and April. That's why it felt like five years, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3156.64s)]
*  but it was really only a little cluster of a couple of months. And Poku watched. Sorry. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3161.68s)]
*  He did. I'm sure he did. How could he not? More about that Poku or Josh Giddy? [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3166.88s)]
*  Josh, he's going to get paid. Yeah. Yeah. I guess he is. He'll get over it. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3172.96s)]
*  I bet money Poku didn't watch. He was like, that was last night. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3177.76s)]
*  I didn't realize. Well, it is interesting because you think of the initial incarnation of this team. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3182.48s)]
*  It was SGA and Giddy together. Right. And then there was this moment where SGA [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3188.88s)]
*  all of a sudden it's like, yeah, Josh, you're just not going to have the ball allowed anymore. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3194.48s)]
*  We have this guy and he's going to average 30 points a game this year. And our whole team [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3199.6s)]
*  is moving this way. So maybe you can learn how to shoot some corner threes and push the ball when [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3203.76s)]
*  you get it. And that was it. And SGA just took the team from him. The Jalen Williams piece him. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3208.88s)]
*  I remember he was such a fun draft guy. We all, I think the ringer was really high on him [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3215.84s)]
*  high on him that year. Right. We're we all in on him as like the, uh, which draft was that? 2022? [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3220.24s)]
*  Was that what you do? It's him. It's him. It's shut it. Shut it. The same drafts. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3227.7599999999998s)]
*  But I remember, I remember Charks left him. Like we were, we were, uh, we loved all the, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3231.2799999999997s)]
*  is there a Jalen Williams for this year for you? Rossello? Do you have one yet? [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3236.72s)]
*  Ooh, uh, you heard of that? A little Carter Bryant. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3241.52s)]
*  I don't like Carter Brian as much as everybody else does. Okay. Apparently like every single [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3245.4399999999996s)]
*  team really likes them. And I'm always kind of like, Oh wow. I guess I'm wrong. We shall see. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3249.68s)]
*  Zach, you should sand, sand that Carter Bryant tape for like about eight minutes. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3256.16s)]
*  You know, but you know who J. double is for me? There's, I actually should make a list [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3260.3999999999996s)]
*  of these guys. There's always a bunch of guys. There's always one guy, every draft, [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3263.7599999999998s)]
*  maybe not even every draft, maybe every other draft who I watch him play. I'm not a college [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3267.7599999999998s)]
*  basketball guy. I'm not doing that stuff like you guys are. I'm just flying. I watch a little [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3272.8799999999997s)]
*  YouTube and do this. That's always one guy who I watch him play his first NBA game. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3276.72s)]
*  And I text like 10 scouts. How the hell was this guy picked 12th or 15th or 17th and not like way [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3282.16s)]
*  higher than that. And Jalen Williams was that guy I watched him play one time. I was like, whoa, [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3289.7599999999998s)]
*  this guy was like, he was 12th, right? Like, and he was like a late riser. He was behind. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3293.9199999999996s)]
*  He was behind Usman. That's right. Same draft. You know, so that's why I'm still excited about [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3298.3999999999996s)]
*  him. Presti took him before. So you know, does Zach know about Usman Island? [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3305.76s)]
*  It's just for silo in a cabin with no electricity, just like [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3312.2400000000002s)]
*  cabin sail. It's on shore. Just washed up on shore. I'm reading. I'm trying to get off like Tom Hanks [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3316.6400000000003s)]
*  and cast away. The waves are smashing your raft. No, he's not giving up. I mean, he's only like 22, [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3324.48s)]
*  right? Isn't he? He's still young. Unfortunately, he's on a team of people who are also 22 and [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3329.2000000000003s)]
*  way better than him. I could see a second unit running their offense through him was a worse [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3334.32s)]
*  roster. But then again, people used to say this about Neesmith Island and look what happened. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3339.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, now I floated out came Whitmore Island today and I'll tell you, we weren't didn't have [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3344.56s)]
*  enough people working in the office to write down all the credit cards. People are in people are [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3350.1600000000003s)]
*  ready. People are saying TJ modeled his game after came Whitmore. So we have final finals [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3355.52s)]
*  odds right now. And Fandol, okay, see is plus two 20. It's like far ahead of everybody else. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3363.28s)]
*  Just to make the finals. No, to win the final win the final. This is about as a [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3368.8s)]
*  prohibitive of a favorite coming out of the finals as we've had. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3373.1200000000003s)]
*  So my thing is if I'm chasing a ring, I'm trying to go east harder than ever now. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3378.0s)]
*  Right? Like we talked about the LeBron scenario. Oh boy. What was that? Four weeks ago? We're so [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3386.88s)]
*  low when I was throwing Cleveland trades you with LeBron, Jared Allen and Deandre Hunter for LeBron. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3392.88s)]
*  Something like that. Little who says no action. Now it's like has to say as the new trade clause. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3400.08s)]
*  Just no, he would have to agree to the trade. But if he's agreeing to trade, there's only one place [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3405.6s)]
*  I think he would go. But if you're LeBron, could you talk yourself into that? I don't know. I'm just [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3410.88s)]
*  I'll put it this way. I haven't taken my eye off that situation. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3416.0s)]
*  I know I sound like a lunatic. If Janis had ended up in the West. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3419.44s)]
*  Right. Well, now I mean, we didn't talk about Milwaukee, but they weren't trading Janis anyway. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3426.56s)]
*  But now they have to feel even more emboldened to keep Janis and see what they can patch together. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3431.52s)]
*  It's a whole conference of why not us? Just every team. Why not us? [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3436.64s)]
*  Is it? Well, I'm going to bring up the Celtics. It's the 56 minute mark. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3441.2000000000003s)]
*  Do the Celtics reevaluate how they're thinking about everything? [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3446.24s)]
*  My quick answer would be only based on the options that present themselves. If somebody [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3452.96s)]
*  thinks they're getting Jaylen Brown at a discounted rate, they're probably just going to say no and be [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3457.92s)]
*  a competitive team next year. I would say no. Yeah, I still think they have to slough off some [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3461.2799999999997s)]
*  pretty major salary just to just to do it. And it's been a really frustrating conversation [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3468.48s)]
*  with Celtic fans in my life who don't seem to understand how the seller cap and trades work. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3475.44s)]
*  Whether you're going to trade, they're going to trade your holiday and get under the [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3480.8s)]
*  second apron. It's like, well, you know, they have to take the contract back. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3484.8s)]
*  Look, I know these things are very complicated and running a sports league and organizing [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3489.92s)]
*  a sports league and a collective bargaining agreement is very hard. The NBA has not helped [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3493.92s)]
*  itself be fan friendly in that regard. Like I like the swaps upon swaps upon swaps upon swaps [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3497.28s)]
*  thing. Like I just have regular people in my life who are like, can you explain [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3503.7599999999998s)]
*  why this pick is? I thought my team had a pick, but my team suddenly doesn't have a pick and [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3508.16s)]
*  it's this pick instead. I'm like, it's let me direct you to Real GM. And even that you might [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3512.7999999999997s)]
*  want to get your attorney to help you understand what's written on Real GM to figure out that one. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3517.9199999999996s)]
*  The only one who has it figured out is is our friend Bobby Marks, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3522.72s)]
*  who just has these screenshots with all the information that he can Twitter pick out at [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3526.72s)]
*  any moment that just tell you exactly what a team has. He's the only one who seems to understand it. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3531.76s)]
*  I remember we're still in, I were doing one pod after they did the CBA and we felt like something [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3537.28s)]
*  substantial had happened, but we didn't understand it. We were like, this feels like something, [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3542.32s)]
*  it just feels like, and we just, and then people started telling us after like, oh yeah, this is [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3550.8s)]
*  a disaster. It's a hard cap. And now Zach officially anointed it a hard cap, but [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3556.32s)]
*  even the Durant trade, I think that was one of the reasons it's just not easy to make trades anymore. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3561.52s)]
*  There are all these trap doors that you forget about like, oh, but if I do that, then I'm capped [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3567.04s)]
*  at the first apron. That's right. If I do this in a trade and like I send a pick over here, then all [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3571.04s)]
*  the first, I'm hard capped at the first apron. So I got to do this. It's like, okay, okay. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3575.76s)]
*  The cap guys should all make like a million dollars. The best cap guys, because it's so [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3580.96s)]
*  goddamn hard. I'm sorry. I just saw a headline on ESPN. Oh, let's hear it. Oh no. SGA in the [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3584.56s)]
*  conversation with Jordan and Kareem. What conversation? Tall, athletic. Wow. Okay, [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3599.6s)]
*  so I see the headline and it's a talking, it's a video clip. So I would watch the video clip. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3610.0s)]
*  Maybe it's single season accomplishment. I'm assuming that's the context I would assume it [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3616.4s)]
*  is in. In which case it's like, okay, 30 points a game, 30 points a game in the finals again, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3622.48s)]
*  finals MVP, regular season MVP. I'm going to listen to it. Yeah. I can't wait. As soon as we're done, [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3627.44s)]
*  I'm going to run that video. Zach's a journalist of the three. He brings up a great point. I get [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3633.6s)]
*  mad whenever it's like somebody else gives you the titles. I'll look at titles of my own podcast [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3638.32s)]
*  being like, that's not what I said. Well, there's just no way that anyone is like now he's in that [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3642.0800000000004s)]
*  class of player for a holistic career. Like no one would ever say that it has to be a single season [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3646.7200000000003s)]
*  thing. Well, there, I mean, the most interesting thing with him is the guard conversation that [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3653.1200000000003s)]
*  he's in now from start to finish seasons. The pool that he's swimming in is pretty crazy. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3657.04s)]
*  We're going to take a break. Zach, are you, you, you have a, you on East coast time and then we're [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3663.52s)]
*  going to talk to rant now. If you want to stay, no, I will, I will parachute out. I will parachute [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3668.7200000000003s)]
*  out and let you guys do the Durant thing. I appreciate you. Let me crash the party. Uh, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3674.4s)]
*  that was really fun party. And I just, uh, weird night, right night in the NBA. You're right, Zach, [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3678.64s)]
*  regular season for one season averages MVP, the whole thing. Great instincts on this guy could be [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3685.84s)]
*  an editor. Uh, thank you. Thank you for making me better. Congrats to the thunder. Uh, I'm going [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3691.04s)]
*  to go watch some TJ McConnell highlights before I go to bed and, uh, and, uh, see what happens. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3697.04s)]
*  Enjoy the Durant guys. All right. Thanks. Zach Gonzalez. All right. So we're staying here on [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3703.52s)]
*  YouTube and, uh, we're in talk to rant. We got traded. So on the one hand, I feel like the league [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3709.6s)]
*  should pass a rule. There should be no trades within 24 hours of NBA finals. Game seven seems [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3716.8s)]
*  like a decent rule. And then there, and I don't know how you would enforce it. And, uh, and I [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3721.52s)]
*  thought it was a pretty fun trade. I thought it was an awesome trade for Houston. I just loved it [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3726.4s)]
*  for them. Uh, I don't, we could talk about the Phoenix part after, but just go, why don't you [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3732.1600000000003s)]
*  just take, don't even ask me a question. Houston. Well, we talked about this last week. I had so [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3736.4s)]
*  many more assets in the trade. They didn't give up Jabari Smith in the trade. That's a fucking [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3740.8s)]
*  miracle. Like for Phoenix to trade the rant, it just speaks to what I, I mentioned, I can't [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3745.12s)]
*  remember the last pot I did was Wednesday or Thursday, but like, I just think the offers were [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3752.32s)]
*  so terrible. Um, everyone lowballed them because everybody knew they had to trade them before the [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3756.24s)]
*  draft and everybody knew they wanted to pick. And, uh, it ends up being Jalen green, who I don't know [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3761.44s)]
*  if there's four teams that they could spin him to for 33 million a year. And then Dylan Brooks, [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3768.4s)]
*  who at 21, 22 million a year, I think is a solid asset if you're trying to, trying to win games. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3774.32s)]
*  And then the 10th pick and that's basically the trade. So I think for Houston, no brainer, [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3781.92s)]
*  10th pick wouldn't have played for them. Plus you, you get rid of Brooks. Now you get to play [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3790.0s)]
*  Tari Easton and Whitmore basically give them those minutes plus I'm in Thompson. Like I just thought, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3795.44s)]
*  I thought the trade was a home run for them. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3800.0s)]
*  Yeah, I loved it. I'm stone is on an absolute heater. He's, he's been incredible that the [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3803.52s)]
*  draft picks, they've been incredible and how they've worked, uh, a lot of this stuff. And yeah, [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3809.68s)]
*  we knew that they were limited offensively like the Durant market, right? The Durant market, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3814.88s)]
*  if we go through it, you knew it was getting bad when you were just least hearing the rumors of like [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3819.2s)]
*  Miami won't include who first started with like Kaleo where you're like, okay, I could see why you [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3824.32s)]
*  just wouldn't want to be in a hurry or you would say no until you think like if you wanted to rant [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3828.32s)]
*  that bad, you're saying no about where for days until maybe then you finally give in. But then [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3832.32s)]
*  you're like, haques wasn't come on, right? There's no, there's no way because the salary piece that [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3836.7200000000003s)]
*  you're moving out in Wiggins I think is less attractive than Brooks because Wiggins is probably [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3842.32s)]
*  going to get you some numbers, but I don't know that he impacts the game the same way Brooks does. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3848.4s)]
*  And by the way, shout out to Brooks for all the jokes when the Lakers eliminated and granted, [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3851.84s)]
*  he brought a lot of it on himself and then he wouldn't do anything with the media after they [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3856.0s)]
*  would lose. So it's not like I was feeling bad for him, but like dudes didn't think he was going to [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3859.52s)]
*  be in this league. And I still think he's somebody who impacts games. And when that contract came out [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3862.8s)]
*  and Houston gave all that money to Brooks and gave the massive deal to Fred Van Vliet, a lot of us [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3869.04s)]
*  are going like, man, that is so much money for that level of dude. But it's like, well, we got [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3873.6s)]
*  to spend it on somebody. We probably have to overspend this way now over Houston. And they [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3877.04s)]
*  flip Brooks into Durant. So like, there's just all these things you can look at with Stone being [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3881.36s)]
*  like, oh, he did that right. That worked out well. So credit to him credit. He went got two guys who [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3885.44s)]
*  he knew could play in playoff series and they did. Right. So like the Yaka Pertle part of it, [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3889.6s)]
*  like, was he really not available? Well, maybe not. I'd probably like him a little bit more than [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3896.0s)]
*  Zach does. And considering how expensive Toronto is, like, they're going to have to get one of the [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3899.84s)]
*  expensive guys get like rid of one of those dudes. When you heard the Knicks rumors, like now we've [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3904.16s)]
*  come full circle. It's like, well, first of all, apparently they didn't want him. But the early [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3909.12s)]
*  stuff on that was Mitchell Robinson and O.G. Now when I look at that, I'm like, [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3913.44s)]
*  Phoenix would have been pumped. I love Mitchell Robinson. Now I was thinking towns for Durant [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3917.68s)]
*  straight up. I mean, that's like three times what Houston paid. Yeah. So that's not happening. And [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3922.64s)]
*  then when it comes back to Minnesota, I can understand, like with Randall, the playoff [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3927.52s)]
*  player option, which he probably opts into it like 30 million. Because I don't think he wants to opt [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3931.28s)]
*  out and go to this free agent market. But then it's like, if you're Phoenix, do you want to get [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3936.56s)]
*  in the Randall business for 30 plus another 60 plus million over two years? I don't know. I don't [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3939.76s)]
*  know. There's a ton of teams that want to do that kind of stuff. And then even San Antonio, and I'm [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3946.0s)]
*  finishing here quickly, but like San Antonio, if they had done it and whatever their case was, [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3949.36s)]
*  I would have been like, OK, that makes sense. And if they don't do it, which obviously they didn't, [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3954.32s)]
*  then I could also understand their position on that one being like, yeah, maybe it doesn't [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3958.96s)]
*  make a lot of sense to add Durant here because you're not just adding a 37 year old player [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3961.92s)]
*  whose terrific score you're adding somebody who doesn't have the greatest history with how [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3965.44s)]
*  happy he stays with franchises and the fact that he's going to cost you like another 120 million, [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3969.52s)]
*  which is probably was worked out ahead of time for him to be like signing off on this, even though [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3973.7599999999998s)]
*  we had heard last summer right around this time, almost exactly to the day a year ago that he wanted [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3977.92s)]
*  Houston, but Phoenix didn't want to move him out. All right. So you put all that together and I [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3982.88s)]
*  think it kind of makes sense that this is what the price ended up being, isn't it? Yeah. Well, [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3987.84s)]
*  for you, Houston, you're getting somebody who can shoot the ball in the last four minutes of a game [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3994.4s)]
*  and maybe appear on a panel about the future of the intersection between athletes and business. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=3998.72s)]
*  There we go. Get those two, those two verticals covered now. Are you mad that Rubin didn't invite [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4004.16s)]
*  you again this year? I got invited. I just went to New York. You didn't go white party. You going to [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4010.24s)]
*  that? I don't go back Easter in the summer. I try not to. How about you? You'll go back once. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4017.2s)]
*  I go back to Vermont. Usually I go back to the vineyard. It's a no brainer for Houston. I think [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4024.64s)]
*  it's great for Durant. I was really excited because I want him to have one last act. I wanted him to [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4028.8799999999997s)]
*  go to the right team. I think Miami is a disaster and I really am dubious how much Miami even wanted [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4034.7999999999997s)]
*  him or what Miami wants to do in general. Because they didn't want to add hotheads, legitimately [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4041.3599999999997s)]
*  didn't want to put him in a deal after all the other guys they want to put in a deal, then they [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4047.12s)]
*  clearly didn't want him that bad. No. If I had a buddy who was selling Ford Bronco and I knew you [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4050.56s)]
*  love Ford Broncos, I'm like, this dude, it's like a 1973 Ford Bronco. He's giving it away. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4060.16s)]
*  You're like, yeah, I don't know. I'm like, but you told me last week you really wanted a Ford [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4066.56s)]
*  Bronco. This guy, it's right here. I just don't think Miami knows what they want to do. We talked [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4070.4s)]
*  about this last week. I think they're a mess. I don't think they have any idea whether they should [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4077.28s)]
*  be trying to pursue and try to be good in the playoffs or go the other way. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4083.0400000000004s)]
*  Durant didn't happen to give him an extension. Just didn't seem like they want to do it. You're [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4087.44s)]
*  paying $100 million a year to him and Tyler. Where are you going? A year from now? Is that a recipe [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4092.5600000000004s)]
*  for anything? In the East? Well, I guess in the East. Anyway, with Houston, [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4099.04s)]
*  what's really interesting to me about this is they kept their flexibility for one more trade [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4108.8s)]
*  if they want to do it. I don't know whether that trade happens in the summer or whether it happens [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4113.36s)]
*  in the December, January, February range. For instance, as we covered many times, Yannis is [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4118.4s)]
*  not getting traded this summer. But if it's January and the bucks are 15 and 25 and he's like, [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4125.28s)]
*  you know what? This sucks. It's time. Poor box fans. They still have their chance. If the Celtics [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4132.0s)]
*  changed their mind and they're like, God damn, we didn't realize we'd be this bad and we're going [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4139.5199999999995s)]
*  to pay how much money in luxury tax? Yeah, maybe we will trade Jaylen Brown. They have the flexibility [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4143.12s)]
*  still on some of the assets to make a second move, which I thought this was going to be their move. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4148.5599999999995s)]
*  This might be move number one. So I thought from that standpoint, great. And then from a Durant [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4154.4s)]
*  standpoint, I'm excited to see him in playoff games again, because I thought it sucked those [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4158.879999999999s)]
*  teams that he was on basically since that Brooklyn bucks game were not fun teams to watch, [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4163.28s)]
*  and teams that had real no real upside from a Phoenix standpoint. I have no idea what they're [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4169.36s)]
*  doing. You have to really like that 10th pick. You have to feel like you're getting somebody who [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4174.799999999999s)]
*  is going to be potentially like an all NBA guy. If that's the centerpiece, because we know it's [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4181.12s)]
*  not Jaylen Green and Booker together. I can't imagine how those guys are playing together. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4187.84s)]
*  And then you got Bradley Beal next to them. What is this? [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4192.0s)]
*  It's a lot of depth. What is this? Yeah. No, I know. One position. I'm worried about your guy. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4197.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't know if you want to talk to somebody about all your Booker stock, but you might want to get [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4205.04s)]
*  rid of some. It won't be diversify the portfolio. Yeah, we're probably going to have to make a call [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4208.56s)]
*  tomorrow. But yeah, there's a lot of other factors. Let's have a Jaylen Green conversation. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4215.120000000001s)]
*  Right now, what do you think of him? I want him to go to a bad team and have the ball a lot for a [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4221.84s)]
*  year. That's what I think. I'd love to see him and maybe Phoenix will be the bad team. I do feel like [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4228.4800000000005s)]
*  there's something there. And I think he's young. And I think he's had stretches that made both of [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4236.0s)]
*  us go, wow, I thought he got worse last year as the season went along. And I thought in the playoffs, [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4241.28s)]
*  they were scared to even have him out there in some of the fourth quarters. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4247.44s)]
*  But he's still young enough that there might be something there. Can you run an offense with him [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4251.2s)]
*  as the creator slash looking out for everybody else? We haven't seen it yet. Well, you could argue, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4256.96s)]
*  which is why I want to see him on a bad team. Yeah, I know what you're saying. I mean, his second [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4262.96s)]
*  year, he had almost a 30% usage rate on a team that won 20 games. So I don't know that Houston's [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4266.4800000000005s)]
*  ever shied away from exactly what you're talking about. But I think- But an older version of him. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4271.92s)]
*  To be fair to you, exactly. I know what you're saying. You're saying, okay, fifth year version [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4277.28s)]
*  of him. I don't know if that's the recipe because clearly he's going to get his buckets if you give [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4280.96s)]
*  him the shots. And when you get drafted as high as he gets drafted, it's a bit like a top draft pick [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4284.96s)]
*  in baseball where they almost always will call him up even if they don't know that he deserves [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4291.36s)]
*  a roster spot. Like Volpe. Like how that Volpe's just in the Yankees even though he's Volpe. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4297.44s)]
*  Big bonuses, signing bonus stuff would happen in baseball all the time where you'd be like, [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4303.759999999999s)]
*  why is this guy getting called up? There's like five other guys in AA that are better than him. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4308.5599999999995s)]
*  But we didn't spend the resources on them. So we have to make sure we know whether we're right or [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4311.599999999999s)]
*  wrong on this guy. So I think it's not apples to apples, but there's a close parallel there [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4315.839999999999s)]
*  between Jamie Green being picked this high and going, all right, go to work. And I know I've [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4320.48s)]
*  already referenced it before too many times on the pod because we just did it. But that stretch [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4324.799999999999s)]
*  when Shungun was out at the end of the regular season last year was when I thought this light [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4329.44s)]
*  went off for him two seasons ago. Yeah. But then you go to where he was [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4333.5199999999995s)]
*  in the playoffs and you're like, Hey, your counters don't work and you can't shoot. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4342.5599999999995s)]
*  And we desperately need like the possessions are there for you. We don't really love any of our [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4349.04s)]
*  options here. It's not like there's two awesome hall of fame scores and you're getting shut out [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4353.599999999999s)]
*  because you're the third option. Like we're allowing you to be a one option here offensively, [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4357.679999999999s)]
*  probably a lot longer than anybody else would want to. And again, credit to Stone. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4361.36s)]
*  We're in the playoffs and we need you. Yeah. Yeah. And you can't so, hey, he didn't, [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4365.12s)]
*  he didn't close out a bunch of playoff games his fourth year in that's probably being a little [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4370.879999999999s)]
*  harsh, but I think he needs to figure out how to play with somebody else. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4374.72s)]
*  And maybe that's good for him and Booker. I don't know. Or maybe they want nothing to do with it [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4380.320000000001s)]
*  and they're happy to get the pick. They're happy to have Brooks to add some kind of toughness [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4384.8s)]
*  because whatever it is Phoenix is doing is it feels like they're still trying to fix this thing [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4388.16s)]
*  on the fly around Booker, which is usually just going to make it worse. I don't think if the goal [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4392.16s)]
*  is to keep Devin Booker as your franchise guy through his entire prime, I don't know if this [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4400.32s)]
*  trade is going to help that. Who's your best case scenario for them in the 10th pick who could [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4405.84s)]
*  actually come in and play real minutes for them and be good for them because I don't, I don't think [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4409.84s)]
*  Malawatch is going to be there. Oh, so I don't know that he's going to be there. I also want some at [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4413.28s)]
*  six. Vasini thinks he will be there when we talk. I don't even know if we did that on the pod [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4418.24s)]
*  because I like Malawatch more than he did. He does way more work on it. So I would defer to him. If [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4425.12s)]
*  you're listening to this, but I listened to that whole podcast on Saturday morning. Thank you, Bill [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4430.0s)]
*  had a coffee seven o'clock in the morning. When somebody writes 160,000 words about the draft, [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4434.24s)]
*  I'm going to give them an hour. It's literally run 160,000 words. It's insane. That's like [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4441.68s)]
*  almost the size of what my book was just banging about. Unbelievable. Yeah, it's unbelievable how [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4448.96s)]
*  and so we were talking about the Malawatch range because then I, there was this guy, Noah, [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4458.48s)]
*  a San Gay who's playing in the German league and then somebody else hit me up. It was like, [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4463.5199999999995s)]
*  you know, when we went to their facility, they were playing your podcast. Do you feel bad now [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4468.799999999999s)]
*  about what you said about us and gay? I was like, you know what? I'm mad. I'm mad that draft people [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4474.4s)]
*  are talking about his incredible free throw rate and I'm like, I watched the games. I can't believe [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4478.32s)]
*  the horseshit stuff that he made him better. Maybe it was a wake up call for him. You're talking [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4483.12s)]
*  about how he's falling down all the time. Yeah, get up, dude. What's going on down there? So yeah, [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4487.92s)]
*  if there's a center, but this is a weird because after Malawatch, unless you like Baron Jair more, [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4494.0s)]
*  which I don't think that's, that seems a little high for him. I do like so over the kid from [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4501.84s)]
*  Georgetown. And again, the mock stuff is stupid because then you keep looking at him and you're [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4506.0s)]
*  like, I love this guy at 14. Yeah, but there was one take him at 10. No, but there was one, [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4509.92s)]
*  you guys had a disagreement on one guy that I thought was fascinating because I thought fears [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4514.48s)]
*  was guaranteed top 10 and Sam had him 18th and was like, look, I don't like small guards. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4519.839999999999s)]
*  And he can't show me. He's like, show me this, show me this small guard with shooting issues. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4526.0s)]
*  That's come into the NBA and been awesome. And I was like, ah, cause I just had him in that seven [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4530.879999999999s)]
*  to nine range just assumed, but then that put the fair guy to me a little bit. What I do love about [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4536.4s)]
*  this draft after the first two is that like Trey Johnson, the Texas kid makes the most NBA type [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4543.04s)]
*  shots of any player in this draft. Right. And can't finish anything. Can't finish the room. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4548.8s)]
*  Just at all. Numerous numbers. What he's like basically the best version of Eddie [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4555.04s)]
*  house you've ever seen in your life. That was, that's my trade. Jetson take it's any house [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4559.36s)]
*  out of heater. He's a little bigger than Eddie. VJ has got the most motherfucker in him out of [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4565.2s)]
*  this group and canipple is the most adaptable. And I don't know what's going to happen. Cause [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4572.08s)]
*  then you keep hearing that Utah likes fears at five, because if you're talking yourself into fears, [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4577.36s)]
*  you go, he can already get to the rim and get past defenders in a way that is so special. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4581.84s)]
*  There's no way they can take him fifth. I can't accept it. Why? Because of Utah's roster, [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4587.92s)]
*  because of him. I just think he's, you can't, you have to take who's left between VJ and [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4592.88s)]
*  ACE Bailey and canipple. You have to. And if you want to get nuts and take [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4601.04s)]
*  values there, maybe fine. You can talk me into the centerpiece, but you can't take fears. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4606.72s)]
*  Twin towers, Kessler, Malawak, Linden trade, Kessler to the Lakers for the two first round picks. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4612.16s)]
*  They've been allegedly offering for a year and a half. I just feel like [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4617.68s)]
*  Utah's have to, they have to be dying for VJ or canipple to get there. And if neither of them [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4622.8s)]
*  in there, they're just going to take Trey Johnson. Cause he'll, he's the best asset at five. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4627.12s)]
*  That's how it has to play out. I don't know what Danny's role is as far as like the final say [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4631.5199999999995s)]
*  now with Austin there. And of course, Zanuck was a big part of all of this stuff that happened, [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4637.76s)]
*  but Danny was getting on credit. Ryan Smith has final say listening to Danny. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4642.24s)]
*  And I think those other guys are in the room would be my guess. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4646.8s)]
*  Ace feels like such a Danny pick. It really does. To be like, what's wrong with you? [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4650.88s)]
*  Right. Yeah. He's like, I watch ACE. I see a 30 point a game score. Yeah. Cause the stuff to be [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4655.84s)]
*  scared of with ACE it's so funny. Cause if he turns out to be a bust, you go see the stud, [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4663.6s)]
*  the way he handled his representation, the Rutgers, that team never won. The, the, the, [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4670.8s)]
*  the fact that is a sister rate. You could just point to all these different things, but like, [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4677.76s)]
*  if you watch the right YouTube clip on him, you like, like you think he's in the running to go [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4684.56s)]
*  head to head with flag and Harper. Like there's one of those hoop intellect had some really good [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4689.6s)]
*  YouTube videos. Shout out to that guy. I don't understand why you want, do you not have synergy [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4694.08s)]
*  access? No, but I'd like watching, I like the YouTube guys where the guy tells me the strengths [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4698.08s)]
*  and weaknesses. I like those clips. There's a hoop intellect does a good one. Cause I think [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4702.8s)]
*  there's like a Marty Conlon YouTube clip still going around being like, how did it not happen [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4706.4s)]
*  for this guy? Well, that's the thing you, I like seeing the weaknesses. Cause like VJ, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4710.08s)]
*  the weaknesses were what you pointed out. It's like, how come every time he drives to the basket, [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4716.0s)]
*  he whips the ball against the backboard and it goes flying the other way. It's like, [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4720.64s)]
*  at some point the guy can't make a layup. That seems like an issue, but with ACE, [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4725.04s)]
*  there was a chase down block section. That was like the most exciting 45 seconds I've had in June, [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4729.68s)]
*  other than maybe the Halliburton game winner and game one. He looks like LeBron on these chase [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4735.52s)]
*  down blocks, like 2012 LeBron. So I don't, there's just like a lot going on both ways. Like [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4741.280000000001s)]
*  can clearly score from 18 to 20 already, like nobody you've seen, but I also think he might [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4747.12s)]
*  not play for two years. So for Utah, do you care? Well, Utah should be doing anything based on need. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4753.52s)]
*  And the fact like I'm always trying to think about like, cause Danny's drafting habits [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4760.16s)]
*  anytime he just, you're like, Oh, Marcus smart. Yeah, that makes sense. And you could say, [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4765.4400000000005s)]
*  I remember one time I'd asked him, we had like press availability. I didn't go to many of those, [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4769.4400000000005s)]
*  but one time I was just there wall fam and I went, what's the most important asset? Like what's the [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4773.360000000001s)]
*  most important trait to have? And it was, he was like, Oh, he's shooting, like shooting, shooting. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4778.64s)]
*  So then you're like, okay, well that doesn't really make a lot of sense with fears. And then [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4784.8s)]
*  you could count that by saying, well, he took Rondo. It's like, no, he took Rondo because he [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4787.4400000000005s)]
*  thought Rondo was a freak and every other thing. It's like, took him 20th. Right. He also couldn't [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4790.4800000000005s)]
*  believe how much he had fallen. Cause I think they had him like six or seven, but the Jalen [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4794.64s)]
*  Brown conversation, cause you remember that draft very clear. It's Ben Simmons, it's Ingram one and [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4798.160000000001s)]
*  two. And then it was a constant, like, what the hell is going to happen at three? Because there's [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4802.160000000001s)]
*  all these other names. People kept thinking Chris Dunn. It's like, well, if they don't like him and [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4805.76s)]
*  he played a Providence, then nobody should want to draft them. Even though Chris Dunn had a nice [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4809.68s)]
*  little revival this year with the Clippers, but certainly not where you're thinking of with the [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4813.04s)]
*  number three pick, but the Jalen Brown conversation, because that Cal year was a mess. Right. Cal was [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4815.84s)]
*  there. That other kid was there. There were big time recruits and like, Jalen didn't even look [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4821.2s)]
*  like he knew how to play basketball yet. But the age argument was physically, he was so gifted [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4824.4s)]
*  in his size and there were still some like, you know, we're talking about Jalen Brown's handle [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4832.08s)]
*  a cow, but he, he wasn't worried about all the other basketball stuff as much as he thought, [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4836.96s)]
*  like this guy kind of fits the mold of this big athletic wing. And you know, if we let them just [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4841.92s)]
*  kind of get loose, he might figure some things out. And I've been thinking about that when I've [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4847.04s)]
*  been thinking about Bailey, but the difference that we know, can we, can I add one thing on that [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4851.92s)]
*  Danny thing? Cause it's a really important point you just made. And there's one piece you're missing [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4855.5199999999995s)]
*  and we've talked about it before, I think a million years ago, Danny loves pedigree. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4859.76s)]
*  And if you go back, like you mentioned that Jalen thing, the ESPN top 100, Jalen was the fourth guy [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4864.64s)]
*  in that class, right? Danny doesn't care about what, oh, what was your college year like? Like [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4870.88s)]
*  they took Avery Bradley that year at 19. He was the number one guy in high school the year before [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4876.96s)]
*  ACE Bailey, the number two guy a year ago and went to this weird Rutgers team where they basically [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4881.4400000000005s)]
*  just had two guys and nobody else, right? It's got weird representation. It's all fixable stuff. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4887.2s)]
*  Danny's going to look at the pedigree, which is why I don't feel like, [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4893.2s)]
*  I don't feel like fears is in play for them. If you look at that draft last year, [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4896.8s)]
*  first of all, there were five guys that were 95s or higher in that draft class, Cooper one, [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4900.72s)]
*  ACE two, VJ three, Harper four, Trey Johnson five. And I just think he's a pedigree guy and he's [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4909.28s)]
*  going to take one of those five guys, whoever's left there taking. And if it's Bailey, they're [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4916.64s)]
*  taking them. It's a great point. Cause it was a big Bob Myers thing back in the day, like Patrick [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4920.32s)]
*  Baldwin Jr. was a five star. He was supposed to go to Duke. Then right. That's a good example. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4924.16s)]
*  Kavanh Looney was like a big time high school guy before he went to UCLA. So there's a lot of that [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4929.36s)]
*  stuff there too. The Avery Bradley calls perfect. Now what I'd also say, and this is really about [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4934.16s)]
*  the draft and trying to figure out what the hell Utah is going to do is if Ainge thinks that ACE [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4938.4s)]
*  is not wired to be competitive because it's clearly Jaylen Brown had that in him. Yeah. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4944.4s)]
*  You know, even if you don't like Jaylen Brown, like, you know, when he takes the court, like [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4950.48s)]
*  rational confidence, right? He thinks he's going to win. If he picks up on anything that he thinks [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4954.16s)]
*  like ACE has checked out when it comes to that. So even with the pedigree, even with the physical [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4960.639999999999s)]
*  stuff, even with the classic, like, I can't believe this guy's still here at five because that's what [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4964.8s)]
*  it would be if they were to take them and go, we're not even good now. So the idea that we're [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4968.96s)]
*  supposed to worry about how does he fit in with the rest of the roster? Like who cares? Yeah. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4972.88s)]
*  If they don't take them, I would imagine there's something that Ainge thinks is alarming about the [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4978.72s)]
*  way the kid is wired, which is again, why everybody makes mistakes on this stuff. Cause we don't really [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4984.72s)]
*  know. The wizards passing him on six. That will mean there's some real fears going on that all the [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4988.56s)]
*  NBA people know and we're not even knowing about like just about work ethic, work habits, stuff like [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=4997.04s)]
*  that. Because for the wizards to pass on him would be insane. That's like a miracle if he gets to six. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5002.0s)]
*  It wouldn't make a ton of sense there. And it would at least make more sense that that's why [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5008.56s)]
*  he's shutting down these interviews and workouts. Cause he's thinking, which a lot of the guys do [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5011.84s)]
*  think it's like, well, if I go to Washington, I can give up the money from pick three to pick six [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5017.360000000001s)]
*  because I'm going to get so many touches. Although Bob Carrington may have something to say about that. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5023.04s)]
*  Let me show you how it works here in Washington. I like Bob. So, [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5030.56s)]
*  okay. Well, let me ask you, what do you think Darrell's going to do if he has to have the pick? [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5034.0s)]
*  Cause you know, [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5038.0s)]
*  so two options. You love this. This is draft week is my favorite. Rossello. If they keep the pick, [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5042.96s)]
*  I think it's Vijay. I've been saying that all along. I just think he fits the Darrell profile. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5052.0s)]
*  I feel like they're going to do some trade back a spot, trade back, like stay in the top five, [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5056.5599999999995s)]
*  but try to trade back and pick up an asset and try to leverage Charlotte, who I think really does [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5062.639999999999s)]
*  once at once Vijay. And I think if Charlotte can move up for not a huge price and take Vijay and [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5067.28s)]
*  just make sure they get him at three, I just, I feel like he's going to move back a spot and end [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5076.32s)]
*  up with Kniepel. Kniepel checks a lot of Darrell boxes, can play with the lineup they have. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5081.76s)]
*  He's got size, he rebounds. There's some stuff when, when flag wasn't playing or when flag was [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5089.76s)]
*  in foul trouble where the offense said, like, I don't know. I mean, I'm, I'm biased because I [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5095.92s)]
*  like them, but I just feel like he's the most additive guy in the draft and Darrell has always [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5100.400000000001s)]
*  gravitated toward those guys. Like remember he made that joke about the draft, but he's [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5105.6s)]
*  made that shame bad day trade. How many years ago was that? It was just like, [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5111.28s)]
*  we didn't have the stats to quantify all the stuff. Shame bad day was good at Darrell had the first, [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5116.24s)]
*  the 1.0 version of those stats and was just like, no, no, when he's in the lineup, [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5120.400000000001s)]
*  all of these awesome things happen and there, it's not about the counting stats. It's this, [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5125.28s)]
*  this, this, this, this, and this. I think can nipples like that. I think they need a guy like [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5129.4400000000005s)]
*  that. They need like a connector shooter. Doesn't need the ball that much. That's asking a lot though [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5133.28s)]
*  of a team with now title aspirations coming in and being like, all right, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5138.96s)]
*  do you honestly think they have title aspirations? Cause I don't. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5143.04s)]
*  You think like they think you think Darrell thinks, Oh, everyone's talking about Cleveland [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5147.44s)]
*  and Orlando and like, why, why not us? Like, I think he's thinking can Embiid play 40 games. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5151.36s)]
*  Okay, sure. Right. But I was thinking about this the other day and like the hall that Phoenix sent [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5158.24s)]
*  out for Durant and what they get, you know, not even two years later, right? It's, it's [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5165.04s)]
*  what we call sunk cost. It's brutal. Like when you see the side by side and you're like, that is one [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5170.56s)]
*  way we both like the trade. We just didn't understand why I came Johnson was in it is my [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5177.36s)]
*  memory, but we both thought it was a good, it was a good trade for them. They're getting an awesome [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5182.24s)]
*  player. You know, I'm fine with thinking it's, it's good to get Kevin Durant if you can get him. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5186.0s)]
*  Yeah. If that ends up being something I still don't know why Kim Johnson was in it. But, [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5191.36s)]
*  but yeah, you're right. Look, it's very new owner syndrome. Right? So yeah, two really was two years [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5196.96s)]
*  of not even, well, right. We have to go back to February. When was the trade? It was February, [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5203.36s)]
*  right? Superbowl week. Cause there was an Arizona. I was thinking about Phoenix this morning [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5210.5599999999995s)]
*  when you were hearing that it might happen. And the side by side thing we just talked about, but [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5218.320000000001s)]
*  it's very simple to be like, well, they shouldn't have waited. So, well, they just got them. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5224.72s)]
*  Okay. So, right. And if you're Phoenix, you're going, we won 47 games last year. And we didn't [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5228.080000000001s)]
*  have all of our guys or 45 games, excuse me. We didn't have all of our guys playing together at [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5238.240000000001s)]
*  the same time. You know, we didn't have enough flexibility. We kind of figure out some things on [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5246.16s)]
*  the margins. And if these three guys can all play together and we feel a little bit better about the [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5251.2s)]
*  center rotation and we have shooting to play off of what should be a ton of help to these three [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5254.5599999999995s)]
*  dynamic on ball scores. That's when people were still tricked by Beal. I don't blame Phoenix for [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5259.28s)]
*  saying if, because this league more than any other league, you could argue with the same with [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5264.5599999999995s)]
*  quarterbacks and your pitching staff and break and spring training, but because there's so few [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5270.0s)]
*  players, there's way more conversation of talking yourself into the if scenario. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5274.88s)]
*  We went way over on the sun's 47 and a half. We thought they were gonna be good last year. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5280.8s)]
*  Yeah, I thought they were right there with them. So they're thinking, hey, if we could, if this, [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5286.56s)]
*  if this were to break, you know, it's better than the unknown or like hitting the reset button when [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5292.0s)]
*  the owner gets pissed about it. Your business partners get pissed about it. Your vet players [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5296.8s)]
*  get pissed about it. You know, we in the media really overrate the simplicity of just, wow, [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5301.44s)]
*  tear it all down and start all over again. The same reason why the Clippers would sit there again [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5306.48s)]
*  and go, well, hey, look, but if, but if Kawhi is healthy and here were the Clippers with this [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5311.36s)]
*  incredible close of the season, maybe the best defense in the NBA over that stretch, and then [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5318.24s)]
*  they lose in the first round again. All right, whatever. I imagine Josh Harris and Daryl and [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5322.24s)]
*  everybody's playing this if game, especially with all of the injuries that we've seen throughout the [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5328.0s)]
*  East in the playoffs. So for you to say like, do I think they're a title contender with Embiid's [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5333.28s)]
*  track record? It's not a good bet, but the if scenario here is even more appealing than it was [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5337.6s)]
*  yesterday for them. So that's why I like it much even as much as I love canipple. Can you imagine [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5344.0s)]
*  Embiid trying to play 10 straight playoff weeks though? That's why I can't come on. No, I can't. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5350.64s)]
*  You're right. I can just I'm out. I've given up on that possibility. I would say 50 to one odds. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5355.68s)]
*  But but what if you know, they're they're right. What if he does? What if he does? What if it's March [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5363.4400000000005s)]
*  and you're like, hey, you know, Cleveland has a great regular season record. The Knicks have a [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5373.04s)]
*  really nice record. If the Knicks are the same team, they're going to be good. Even with a [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5377.76s)]
*  different coach, they're still going to be a really good team. And then, you know, is the Orlando, [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5382.24s)]
*  this fronds ever going to hit a fucking shot here? Right? If you're the Sixers, like, I don't know [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5385.76s)]
*  that you should be afraid of any of that stuff. The scariest thing is the team that you see in [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5391.599999999999s)]
*  the mirror, not necessarily anybody else in the Eastern Conference. So I know this has become a [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5396.08s)]
*  far more expanded conversation around conca nipple. And we both love the guy. But that's asking a lot [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5401.12s)]
*  of him. Like, all right. Huge game five minutes ago in the fourth quarter. Like, all right, [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5407.04s)]
*  we're going to get con initiating some of this stuff. No, but I do think he could play 20 to [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5412.64s)]
*  25 minutes a game for a good team. I think he can figure out anything that is needed of him. It's [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5417.68s)]
*  just a matter of whether or not he'll be able to execute those things like he won't be lost in the [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5422.88s)]
*  basketball court because he's so like that was my favorite thing once I really dug into him. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5426.4s)]
*  Just how smart he was off ball cutting. And, you know, when he I just there's so many [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5431.6s)]
*  basketball players when they have the ball and it's all predetermined, it's fine. But when they get [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5437.68s)]
*  stuck, you know, it's like a college quarterback who we were talking about this, I think with [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5441.52s)]
*  the senior college quarterback is like, all right, these are the two reads. Like, this is the this is [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5447.120000000001s)]
*  who you're trying to beat. If you see the safety, do this, then just throw it underneath. Keep moving [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5451.200000000001s)]
*  the chains. It's like, all right, so this guy threw 4000 yards. Like, is he good? And like, no, [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5454.88s)]
*  he's not any good. And there's a lot of guards that it's like, OK, we're setting the ball screen [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5458.96s)]
*  here. You're going to go here. If the help comes off the corner, then it's open to three. And if [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5464.8s)]
*  this guy plays up, then you should be able to have the role guy. And it's like, what happens [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5469.2s)]
*  if both things stop? Am I going to like, yeah, I have to decide. I have to come up with something. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5472.56s)]
*  And that's one of my favorite things about can nipples that I thought he saw the game [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5478.64s)]
*  at a level that I couldn't believe for his age. He'd be really good for any of these teams. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5482.0s)]
*  The thing that's a bummer is that the number three pick isn't like we have like flag. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5488.08s)]
*  And then we have Harper and then it drops again. I wish the number three pick was good enough [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5493.92s)]
*  that we could really have a Utah Paul George trading up from five to three. But you have to [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5498.240000000001s)]
*  take Paul George's contract like I actually wish because I think I think Danny would do it. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5503.6s)]
*  I don't think he would care. Like, fine. Paul George is still pretty good. If we can go from [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5508.96s)]
*  five to three and get this guy, I'll take the contract. I don't care. But it's not worth it [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5514.64s)]
*  in this draft to do that. I don't think five to two is a different scenario, but I don't think the [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5519.68s)]
*  Spurs would go near. I think the one thing that's changed over the last two weeks, I said this to [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5524.72s)]
*  you last week is I think once the Spurs got a little closer to Harper, really like diving into [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5529.6s)]
*  him, they were like, oh shit. Okay. We don't screw the Kevin Durant idea. And I still wonder with [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5535.6s)]
*  Fox is I still think a wild card for the summer. Yeah, I you got to wonder though, like if that was [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5542.8s)]
*  the Fox market that just happened, then but wasn't part of that teams were afraid of clutch and they [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5550.4800000000005s)]
*  wanted to go to the Spurs and Pete some people kind of backed off because they felt like he was [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5560.320000000001s)]
*  headed that way. Anyway, I don't think I don't feel like it was an official trade market. It seemed [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5564.72s)]
*  like he's like he wants to go there. And then that's how it played out. Okay, but that entirely [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5569.68s)]
*  may be true. And I think there is. It's hard for me to remember all this stuff with this, but [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5575.4400000000005s)]
*  it's always a good reminder that when we hear about like teams making calls, and I've even [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5581.6s)]
*  made this mistake too, which I regret when I make it. But I think these teams are constantly [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5586.4800000000005s)]
*  canvassing the league to kind of get an idea of like, Hey, would you ever do this without any [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5594.320000000001s)]
*  intention of ever doing those things, but just trying to figure out what the value is and that [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5598.4s)]
*  Fox trade. I didn't really give up. Now it was a no brainer. Yeah. So so you're bringing in even [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5603.44s)]
*  as flawed as like even the most the most ardent detractors of Fox. I still like them. I still [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5610.08s)]
*  like to hear in Fox. You know, it's perfect. But I like them. But the market wasn't that strong for [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5617.36s)]
*  him. You don't like him as much when he gets like a $230 million extension for four years. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5622.879999999999s)]
*  Might not like them quite as much, but I still like them. If both of us were GM's. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5628.48s)]
*  Like you're running in New Orleans. I'm running like Charlotte. I would call you all the time. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5634.96s)]
*  Why I would have like five GM friends that I just called constantly to check in. And then [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5642.5599999999995s)]
*  every once in a while I'd be like, no, what's up with what's up with Mark Williams? And just, [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5647.12s)]
*  you know, because I'm sure they just are shooting the shit on the phone, right? [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5655.360000000001s)]
*  It's like, oh, my buddy's calling. And then at some point you can kind of steer it toward [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5659.4400000000005s)]
*  feeling out if a guy's available or not. And I'm sure that like Danny and Kevin McHale, [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5664.72s)]
*  I'm sure Danny would do that all the time when Michael was in Minnesota, right? [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5669.4400000000005s)]
*  You're not going to take KG, right? And he's just, you know, just kind of working it. But I think [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5673.280000000001s)]
*  that's how I think how this is how some of this shit works. I think these guys just, [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5678.4800000000005s)]
*  there's certain guys that just call everybody all the time. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5682.32s)]
*  I imagine like anything there's talkers, guys that can't help themselves. And it's like, [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5685.28s)]
*  even though he's my friend and I've known him for 30 years in the business, if I can just get him on [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5689.679999999999s)]
*  the phone, start bullshitting, like maybe he'll say something. Because that was the old Dan Duquette [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5692.96s)]
*  thing is that he used to not talk. You'd be on the phone with him and you wouldn't, he wouldn't say [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5698.5599999999995s)]
*  anything. You have to make conversation. Right, right. Because the John Walsh interview move, [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5703.2s)]
*  John Walsh's famous move, not talk. You'd be, you're on a job interview and he would just be [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5708.24s)]
*  silent and it was like a power move. And then you would start talking. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5715.44s)]
*  Yeah. He recommended a good book when I met with him. Yeah. Game changer. He'll do that. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5721.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Do that too. Let's stay on this though, because I was thinking about the Luca trade again. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5727.04s)]
*  And great example, the best ever example. Exactly. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5731.6s)]
*  You know, just bitching about Luca, Luca Dodge, one day and, and Polinka going, Hey, [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5736.4800000000005s)]
*  and then all of a sudden they're, they're negotiating. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5744.0s)]
*  Right. Cause I was looking at all the picks that Bain got. It was like, [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5746.160000000001s)]
*  you know, we're not sure that Luca is going to resign here. So we can only give you this, [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5751.200000000001s)]
*  this one pick. We can't even do a swap. We can't even do a swap. I don't know if Polinka will [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5756.08s)]
*  ever write a book, but since Nico's his guy, which he clearly had the inside track on this entire [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5762.24s)]
*  thing, why there was no market for Luca because no one else knew that he was available. And some of [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5767.04s)]
*  this after the fact reporting on like, well, they had called this team, but then you hear from the [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5771.04s)]
*  team that they're like, we, we didn't, they were asking for our best player saying, Luca wasn't [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5775.76s)]
*  part of it. We didn't like whatever you want to do to make this look better for Nico. But if [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5781.76s)]
*  Polinka ever writes a book and I wish you could get Polinka to like completely tell the truth, [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5785.76s)]
*  but like that moment when Nico said, I would do this, I would do Luca for [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5791.12s)]
*  AD and you know, figure out the rest of it. AD and Reeves and it'd be like, [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5796.4800000000005s)]
*  well, we're not trading Reeves. Is it still a conversation? And there's a pause and it goes [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5800.96s)]
*  like, yeah, there might be. I feel like what? Huh? Because you wonder if Rob, based on what [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5806.32s)]
*  we're talking about, like what guys calling each other is Rob thinking, I've heard you [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5812.96s)]
*  bitch about this guy for like two years because we've known each other for so long. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5817.36s)]
*  And was that, I don't know, this is all hypothetical. I don't know the answer to stuff. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5822.24s)]
*  That's why I wonder if it would ever come out of the book because could Rob ever just be like, [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5825.5199999999995s)]
*  I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe it. And then make his friend Nico look bad, [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5828.48s)]
*  which would feel kind of shitty if they still have a good relationship. I mean, [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5832.0s)]
*  Palinka should love him now. But if Palinka would ever in that moment, honestly answer 20 years from [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5835.36s)]
*  now in some interview where he was on the phone being like, holy shit, I can't believe I'm actually [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5841.44s)]
*  going to be able to do a trade that a trade like this, that is just not supposed to happen. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5848.5599999999995s)]
*  I would also love to know the whole Magic's last year with the Lakers when Magic went on first take [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5853.5199999999995s)]
*  and said he got stabbed in the back by Plinka and then they were fine. I would love a whole chapter [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5860.32s)]
*  on that in the Plinka book. I'd also love a chapter on the, on playing with the Fab Five, [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5867.5199999999995s)]
*  the Plinka book I'm, I'm signing up right now. I'm pre-ordering it. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5871.759999999999s)]
*  Mark Twain would publish it. He was big in the publishing business, killed it with grants, [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5875.84s)]
*  but then wanted to do a book on the Pope and the Pope was like, are you sure? [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5880.799999999999s)]
*  Are you reading a Mark Twain book right now? [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5885.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Just finished Chernow's Mark Twain book. I already interviewed Chernow last week. We're [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5887.12s)]
*  going to run a summer. Yeah. Yeah. It was on the list, but you would call me all the time. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5890.88s)]
*  I think I'd get sick of you calling me that much though, because I think you would be trying to get [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5896.32s)]
*  over on me. You'd be like, no, I would just be checking in. Cipriano has a couple of cores, [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5899.5199999999995s)]
*  lights, checking in. Cause I know you would start pitching about somebody on your team within like [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5903.36s)]
*  10 minutes. You'd be like fucking Jose Alvarado, this fucking guy should have seen him. This guy [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5907.76s)]
*  wants a bobblehead. It's like you're lucky you're playing. But see, I would know you too well though, [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5914.96s)]
*  because then you would be on the phone with Darrell being like, Rossello hates Alvarado. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5922.56s)]
*  I think he's dying to get rid of him. Top 50 protected. There must be an honor among people. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5926.56s)]
*  But you must have your two or three GMs where you're like these year guys. If you're bitching [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5932.24s)]
*  about your team to the other GM, I'm sure you get feedback from somebody who works for a team who's [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5938.32s)]
*  listening to this afterwards. But I'm sure you have your guys that you feel like you can vent to. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5943.76s)]
*  I'm sure. Friend to friend. That must exist. I'm sure that exists. But I think this is one of the [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5950.56s)]
*  fascinating parts about the job. And that's why you can bring it full circle here with the thunder. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5958.24s)]
*  Presti, when he's at the combine, back when it was at the old one, when I would host it, [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5963.6s)]
*  yeah, he wouldn't even stand there anymore. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5970.0s)]
*  I don't know if he still does it now because none of us are even allowed to kind of even though [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5977.84s)]
*  we can get in, we can't go to this big section, which is fine. We shouldn't be able to go over [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5981.120000000001s)]
*  that section. And when I was still hosting it, I could walk wherever I wanted to. But [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5985.120000000001s)]
*  now that I have nothing to do with it, I shouldn't be over there. I think I went to get a [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5991.84s)]
*  box score once and I was kind of like, you know what, I shouldn't do this anymore. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5995.120000000001s)]
*  But I remember years and years ago, Presti, like, hey, you're not anchoring anymore, buddy. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=5997.84s)]
*  Put the box score back. Presti was standing by himself like arms folded. And I'm like, [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6003.84s)]
*  is he that freaked out that he can't even sit six seats away from somebody else? [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6008.400000000001s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, maybe. I forget the player, but I think it was Dave Cowens. That was a red [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6013.92s)]
*  armback move where he went to scout Cowens and he stormed out at halftime. And people were like, [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6019.92s)]
*  whoa, red hated Cowens, but he loved him. Yeah. So, you know, anytime he went to a game, [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6025.44s)]
*  people knew he was there. Can we do draft really quick? So Harper second, if you had to bet edge [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6030.639999999999s)]
*  come now is almost a three to one favorite on Fandle to go third. So it was just, would you [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6037.36s)]
*  go chalk and say edge come to Philly number three, canipal four, and Danny says, fuck it. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6042.08s)]
*  And takes ace Bailey five. I don't have a prediction. No, I really don't have any, [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6048.48s)]
*  like I'm probably a day or two away for feeling good about it. You know, just because of just [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6053.44s)]
*  bullshitting with guys and because everybody has a different board for everybody else right now. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6059.28s)]
*  But if you had to pick, if I had to, right. Would you have Bailey going to Utah or somebody else? [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6064.48s)]
*  That means Trey Johnson's going sixth. No, that would be Trey. Yeah. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6074.4s)]
*  My whole Bailey Utah exercise was just you and I talking out. I think seeing what you'd have [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6079.12s)]
*  Trey Johnson Utah. He could shoot. I think you're right. You and I see this day anything the same [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6084.72s)]
*  way. I think he fucking takes ace Bailey, his whole history of the last 20 years [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6092.320000000001s)]
*  is he would take ace Bailey. So unless there's some massive red flag that we don't know about, [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6098.0s)]
*  I just think that's a kind of a, you know, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6103.2s)]
*  a guy he takes unless he, if he feels like, okay, I saw enough from him that I think he might check [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6108.64s)]
*  out of games and he's not, he's not competitive enough. Cause then I think it's kind of a note [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6115.68s)]
*  that's like a deal breaker for somebody like age, because even with the pedigree, you know, [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6120.56s)]
*  I'm not saying everybody's perfect, but he likes guys with a little motherfucker to. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6125.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, well the other Gabe Vincent was starting fights with anybody, but [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6131.92s)]
*  Well, the other piece with him is Gabe Pruitt, excuse me. If you're, are you drafting somebody [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6136.0s)]
*  because you think you have one more tankier in you were what Austin age said about, we're done [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6141.759999999999s)]
*  tanking. Um, if you feel like there's one more year you want to throw away ace Bailey is perfect [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6146.4s)]
*  for that because he's probably a year or two away from having any sort of impact at all. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6151.5199999999995s)]
*  Here's the thing is there's no one you're taking at that pick that is now preventing you from [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6157.04s)]
*  taking true. But I think the ACE is like, he is like an, a project. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6163.36s)]
*  Uh, take it, come in and be fun off the bench. Like I think right away, I think he would be, [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6170.32s)]
*  he definitely be a league pass guy where I could see you texted me in December and be like, yo, [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6176.24s)]
*  you watching Trey right now? Like he's one of those guys. He can absolutely light it up [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6180.799999999999s)]
*  and light it up like 16 points in four minutes kind of guy. So, you know, I know some people [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6186.96s)]
*  talked about like it not being necessarily like the best fit for him. And granted they're making [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6193.04s)]
*  a coach and change anyway, but I mean, that was still a pretty efficient offense from that group. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6196.4s)]
*  And you know, he's going to be set up off the ball a lot, which is probably what they need. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6202.08s)]
*  I mean, God, they've got so many guys who love having the ball in their hands. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6205.84s)]
*  And you know, I don't think that you're sitting here. I think Zach was smart to kind of bring up, [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6209.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't know. Maybe you were, I forget if you were Zach did an hour or so ago, bringing up like, [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6212.56s)]
*  who would it be the line above Jeremy Grant where marketing would be, he would be above it. I would [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6216.0s)]
*  think but marketing is probably not good enough to go, no, we've got our one. Right. Figure out [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6220.4s)]
*  the rest of the pieces later. So, I mean, Austin, age can say we're not tanking. I just, I think the [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6226.5599999999995s)]
*  rule is you can't ever say that you actually are, but I don't know who they would pick to be like, [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6232.719999999999s)]
*  holy shit, they're not tanking now. They just took the VJ fell to them. Right. Can I test drive a [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6236.4s)]
*  couple of draft stuff? I'm not done with my sweep yet, but I'm pretty close. I know I let you down [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6242.96s)]
*  with VJ to three. I'll say, yeah, but you don't let me down. I wanted to test drive a couple, [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6247.76s)]
*  a couple half-assed just doing, doing my rounds, stuff that jumped Malcolm Gladwell, [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6252.96s)]
*  blink test stuff. I love it. I love the, you know what, there's value in the blink test. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6259.280000000001s)]
*  Sometimes I'm pretty good in that. I've been pretty good over the years with that. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6262.400000000001s)]
*  I don't see it with Danny Wolf. I know he's polarizing. I don't see it. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6268.72s)]
*  I didn't shoot it well enough. No, I can't, well, I can't imagine him in games like the ones that [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6274.56s)]
*  we just watched the last two rounds, like just where would he be? Like, could he put up stats [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6281.200000000001s)]
*  on a team? Sure. But like, if I'm actually trying to win the title, where am I playing him? [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6287.68s)]
*  And is the, is the ball running through him? Like I, I just, who, who are the examples of guys like [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6295.120000000001s)]
*  him that have been impact dudes on actual good NBA teams in the last 20 years? I just have a [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6302.56s)]
*  lot of questions. If he's in the 13 to 17 range, that's one thing, but like some people are saying, [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6311.4400000000005s)]
*  like he could go like, you know, in that seven to 10 range, that just seems pretty high to me. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6316.72s)]
*  If you're saying that Danny Wolf to you would not crack the rotation of two of the deepest [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6323.6s)]
*  teams in the NBA that just played for championship, I would agree with you. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6327.76s)]
*  Let's go final four. Let's go final four. Let's go last eight. The problem is, is the best thing [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6330.56s)]
*  about, well, the best thing is probably is rebounding, but it's that you're letting him [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6337.6s)]
*  have the ball in his hands is this six 11 point guard. So there's a little, who's doing that [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6341.92s)]
*  though? When we're in like may taller Joe Ingalls, jingle juice, taller Joe Ingalls. That's [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6347.92s)]
*  interesting. All right. So we've seen that work a little bit. Ingalls was an incredible, like pick [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6355.2s)]
*  and roll read decision guy. And, you know, look, if you stick Danny Wolf in the corner and be like, [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6361.5199999999995s)]
*  Hey, you're only doing this, then don't take them. There's, there's no point. He's a very unique [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6369.2s)]
*  player. The Cedric coward thing worries me like to get on the board there. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6376.72s)]
*  This is a bit like the Jaylen Williams question from before, where it's like a bunch of guys that [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6385.76s)]
*  were draft people were like, you know, he's pretty good as a guy at Santa Clara. And then the first [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6390.4s)]
*  time I watched Cedric Howard, I didn't see where Vasini had him in his rankings. I go, dude, I love [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6394.48s)]
*  Cedric Howard. He goes, yeah, me too. I have him ninth. And I was like, oh shit. Oh, frown face. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6398.72s)]
*  Bill does not like him. I'm not saying I'm out. It's not only watch the aisle game. No, it's not. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6404.96s)]
*  I don't like, I don't know. Like the way they were talking about him, what I heard about, oh, [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6411.04s)]
*  this guy, he's fast, right? Like I started getting the Jaylen Williams in my head and then I watched [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6419.92s)]
*  it and I didn't feel like he was athletic enough on that, on that level. I don't know. I just didn't [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6424.16s)]
*  totally see it. He felt like a 13 to 17 range guy to me. Okay. Again, maybe I'm wrong. This is [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6430.88s)]
*  blink test, but this is like a fast riser. He only played in six games, wasn't clear for contact with [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6440.08s)]
*  his shoulder injury forever. Yeah. Started in D three, goes to Eastern Washington. The three things scared me too. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6446.24s)]
*  I can't lie. He was filthy in those games that he played this year. But if you want to tell me, hey, [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6451.76s)]
*  it was against Northern Colorado. Looked like somebody from the lacrosse team was out there. No offense [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6459.92s)]
*  to Pat, but or Anton, but I would say he was, he was filthy and he was like a man and he was like [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6464.56s)]
*  mean to guys. And then he got some kid in the post where he was like, I'm going to fuck with you so bad [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6475.04s)]
*  that I could score in the first second, but I'll just do it on the third move. So you're in on him. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6480.8s)]
*  Yeah, I like them better than, you know, some of the other guys like, dude, everybody loves Carter [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6486.64s)]
*  Bryant because he's six, eight. He's really young. He can really shoot it. He can play defense. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6491.6s)]
*  Everybody really likes the kid. I'd say like highest approval rating of the kid is VJ or malawatch. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6496.160000000001s)]
*  Teams have talked about just raving about them like VJ just off the charts, I guess, in all of [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6501.84s)]
*  his interviews and his background and everything that he went through. And there's a lot of people [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6506.240000000001s)]
*  really like Carter Bryant, Arizona. I saw a guy that the good parts in that three and D six, eight, [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6509.52s)]
*  whatever. Okay, fine. Like that guy's a very in demand type of player. The second he had to do [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6515.68s)]
*  something with the basketball after like it was either shoot it or it was an outlet pass on a [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6520.96s)]
*  defensive rebound. It was a nightmare. I really like my watch. I think there's a case for him [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6525.84s)]
*  to go sixth. If the whiz took him six, that wouldn't make fun of us. Sar malawatch twin [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6532.64s)]
*  towers, double bigs, Adams, shingoon response case in the finals, a couple of years, little twin [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6539.12s)]
*  towers sent 40 years later in the same San Alajuan. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6545.12s)]
*  Does SAR spacing provide enough for malawatch to operate those lobs? Who's to say no? Right. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6552.16s)]
*  Here's a positive one. I'm kind of talking myself into Derek Queen. I think it depends on the team. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6558.64s)]
*  Big time. I think there's teams where it could be a disaster, but there's a lot of stuff there. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6565.44s)]
*  And then what's the dude's name? Yaka Yaka shown us. How do you say his name? [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6572.08s)]
*  Yeah, I get from Illinois. Yeah. Yeah, you did great. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6580.16s)]
*  That guy's an NBA player. I don't know when it might not be till he's 28 and it could be his [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6584.96s)]
*  13, but there's something there's a, there's a wherewithal he has offensively and how he [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6589.6s)]
*  uses teammates that I just see it. It translates and there's going to, I know he's going to get [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6598.48s)]
*  hunted like all the usual shit with him, but that dude would be fun to play with and is unique and [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6603.28s)]
*  has like an elite skill. I, as you know, I love elite skills. When, when I look at this draft stuff, [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6608.639999999999s)]
*  I'm always like, what's, what's, what's your thing? What's your trump card? What's the thing you have? [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6613.36s)]
*  He would be fun to play with. So I'm, it feels like he's dropping a little, right? Doesn't it feel [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6617.36s)]
*  like he's cooling off on him a tiny bit? What are you talking about? Like outside of the top 10? [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6623.04s)]
*  Initially he was supposed to be, you know, top eight or nine. Now it's feels like he's in the, [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6627.92s)]
*  I don't know, a little lower. He, he probably could shoot it a little bit better. I mean, [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6632.8s)]
*  I like them better than Demen because he can shoot it and Demen just couldn't shoot it all year long, [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6638.16s)]
*  but apparently Demen, the BYU kid is lighting it up and some workouts with the shooting. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6641.76s)]
*  So I'm, I'm out on him. I do not have an opinion on him. I couldn't crack that one. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6647.04s)]
*  That one, I threw my hands up. I don't know what to make him. He's probably a little smaller for [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6650.88s)]
*  the way that he plays. And then Derek Queen, I'll admit, I just don't know that I can figure it out. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6655.52s)]
*  It's all over the place, but sometimes it's really pretty good, man. And then I liked it. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6661.6s)]
*  Was Sam the one that said like, he's just been somebody who's played against men for the last [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6668.400000000001s)]
*  couple of years. I like that. It's meaningful. I like Sorber, the Georgetown kid, because I think [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6672.56s)]
*  he's a legit center. I haven't researched him yet. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6679.2s)]
*  Nick Clifford's probably the most like well rounded guy, but he's, I think he's already 23. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6684.32s)]
*  Where do you stand on Fleming from St. Joe's? I don't know what he is. Well, physically he's [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6689.84s)]
*  a specimen. Okay. So he's enormous. He's like two 30 he's chiseled and, you know, playing in some of [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6696.16s)]
*  the games that I was watching, there are times where I'm like, is he a small forward or is he [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6703.12s)]
*  a center? Because I think he wants to be a small forward. And I'm not saying he should be a center. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6707.52s)]
*  So maybe there's a ton of value in him and his size, you know, stretching the floor for you a [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6713.360000000001s)]
*  little bit. But I think he was so physically gifted. I would have liked to see him make people feel [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6718.160000000001s)]
*  him a little bit more. Yeah. But you know, to be fair, again, I'm not doing this year round. I'm [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6722.88s)]
*  not, you know, watching every single game. I was watching Hugo Gonzalez the other night. I was [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6727.280000000001s)]
*  like, I think he might suck, but I like him. I liked his shot it like he said five different [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6731.04s)]
*  stints in Europe and he hasn't shot over I think 27% for three. And he's not a point guard. So I'm [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6737.92s)]
*  like, okay, how does this work? But I gotta tell you, fun kid, fun little guy out there was not [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6743.12s)]
*  pleased six, six. Shocker of shocker. I like Clayton Jr. minutes, the most predictable bill [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6750.56s)]
*  opinion of all time. But I just don't see how he's not an NBA player. And I don't know how [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6757.2s)]
*  many more times we have to do this with these guys. Brunson was one from way back. But what [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6761.92s)]
*  did he go like 31 32? It's like at some point, at some point, it should matter what we saw. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6768.72s)]
*  There's other times where it shouldn't matter at all. But you can kind of, you have to filter it. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6774.72s)]
*  And he's clearly somebody who could play in NBA games and create his own shot and do stuff. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6779.28s)]
*  Yeah, and the shot making like, yeah, again, trays the best of the class. But there's some [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6783.04s)]
*  Walter Clayton shots where you just go like, I can't even believe like he has the balls to even [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6791.5199999999995s)]
*  take this and then felt like it went in more often. Hanson Yang, I'm gonna give myself the [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6795.92s)]
*  combine there is value in the combine. Okay, didn't speak a look at English when he was at [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6800.08s)]
*  the combine. And so he would just kind of do this like yell when he wanted the ball. Like, ah, ah. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6806.4s)]
*  And then he had this baseline spin with with the ball. Yeah, and one flushes it. I was right there [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6816.96s)]
*  on the baseline when it happened. And I, I tweeted out that I've seen the I think it was on threads. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6825.599999999999s)]
*  I'm on threads a lot lately. I was like, I've seen the future of the NBA. And it's right in front of [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6830.24s)]
*  me. Hanson Yang got a couple of chuckles. The threads audience really liked it. Yeah, and the [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6835.28s)]
*  peanut gallery, you know, at the combine. And now people think he might go in the 30s. So if your [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6840.4s)]
*  team takes Hanson Yang in the 30s, you may have some bit of a project, but you may have something. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6846.8s)]
*  I, I don't mind the Stanford senior because I scouted him because there was some self-exposed [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6852.639999999999s)]
*  with him. So of course, I had to watch all his he was awesome at the combine. He seems intriguing. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6857.759999999999s)]
*  Awesome. Hasn't really been playing basketball that long, which I think sometimes is a bonus. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6861.76s)]
*  Room to grow. Yeah. All right. There's our drafting. I know you're going to be tackling a lot [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6865.84s)]
*  this week. Hopefully we'll have one fun trade. And that's it. I've run out of things to talk about [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6871.68s)]
*  unless you want to talk about what do you do with Connor McDavid? [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6877.4400000000005s)]
*  No, I just want to say one last thing about the Thunder. Yeah, this is a team that finished the [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6882.4800000000005s)]
*  playoffs 11th and rebounding rate 12th and defensive rebounding rate. Their assist percentage was 11th [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6889.36s)]
*  their three point percentage may have dipped down. It was 13th out of 16 playoff teams. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6896.639999999999s)]
*  Might've been worse after today might they had like a couple points. They had to make up there. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6901.36s)]
*  So 13 as of today, they fouled at the third highest rate. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6906.16s)]
*  They had, I think nine games under 30% from three, maybe under 31% from three. So nine bad [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6912.719999999999s)]
*  shooting games in the playoffs. They went five and four of those for this team to win an NBA [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6918.64s)]
*  championship with the lack of shooting and the rebounding being an issue and fouling all the time [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6923.04s)]
*  speaks to how insane this defense was. And we saw it in the third quarter and you can see it like a [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6930.08s)]
*  switch when that group gets connected and says, you know, granted TJ went crazy, but all the turnovers [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6936.0s)]
*  they were committing because of the pressure, I think was a 19 to two run as great as SGA [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6942.88s)]
*  has been at the peak moments and the MVP and deserving all that kind of stuff for a unit to [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6950.8s)]
*  have six, seven guys. It's like, we just got to be dogs defensively and for that team to win a [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6956.4800000000005s)]
*  championship. I know how disappointed everybody is that it wasn't the full version obviously with [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6961.28s)]
*  the Halliburton injury, but that's some pretty special stuff to be able to pull to win 16 games [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6966.400000000001s)]
*  with some of their deficiencies that they had. Yeah. I mean, game four will be the thing I [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6971.28s)]
*  remember about that team watching them just basically refuse to let the Pacers start their [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6976.639999999999s)]
*  offense within 30 feet of the basket for an hour. I've seen good defense before, but I don't know. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6981.5199999999995s)]
*  It was also a team that if you were calling the game and letting them kind of get away with stuff, [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6988.32s)]
*  they became completely unstoppable. Right? It was like an NFL defense where you're like, oh, [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6994.4s)]
*  you're going to let us do this. And then they would just, and I felt like that was happening [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=6998.8s)]
*  a little bit tonight. Once Caruso and Dorton Wallace could really get physical 40, 50 feet [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7002.88s)]
*  from the basket. Yikes. What happens with McDavid? It's going to get worse, not better. This was, [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7008.16s)]
*  it feels like their best chance with the cap. Yep. And here's the thing. Last year, they were [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7016.320000000001s)]
*  a better team where this year people couldn't believe they beat Dallas and Las Vegas [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7022.8s)]
*  where last year they weren't even favored in round one. I think the Kings were favored. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7030.64s)]
*  Kings came out smoking too, right? So, you know, they get to return trip, but I watched all the [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7035.280000000001s)]
*  games. I don't know that I have a ton of great insight on all of it, but this will bother me. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7041.6s)]
*  This will bother me in a way. I don't want to be at Charles Barkley level. Won't be a Chris [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7050.24s)]
*  Mullen level, but it's going to bother me. Like how will the rest of your life be if McDavid [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7054.32s)]
*  never hoist the cup? I feel like he's, I've been watching hockey since when Bobby still was good. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7058.96s)]
*  And he's one of the six or seven just easily best players I've ever seen. And I can't believe he [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7069.12s)]
*  hasn't won a cup yet. I was thinking about something with, with Marsha and the Panthers, [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7074.4s)]
*  how he goes to that team and it's the perfect team for him. Cause they just have a bunch of [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7081.5199999999995s)]
*  fucking assholes that are just agitator assholes. And it was like, finally I'm with my people. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7086.4s)]
*  And it made me think like, I wish the Bruins in retrospect had just been like, you know, [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7091.839999999999s)]
*  we have this guy. He's just so fucking annoying. He drives everybody crazy. We should just get like [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7096.32s)]
*  four more of those guys and just, we become that becomes our identity. Cause I do feel like, [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7102.48s)]
*  like a Vander Kane was so mad that by the end of the series, the game's over, [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7107.36s)]
*  there's two minutes left and he just went over and he slash Kachuk as hard as he could. So he [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7111.839999999999s)]
*  get a game misconduct and not have to be in the handshake line. Like that's, you know, that you, [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7116.48s)]
*  you have a team full of dicks when somebody's like, I just, I can't shake hands with these guys. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7121.919999999999s)]
*  Just, can you kick me out of the game? So it just made me think like that would be an interesting [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7126.16s)]
*  almost like how Presti put together that OKC team of these fucking silent assassins who just get [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7131.28s)]
*  worked on and have no ego and they all do the press conference together. Could you have done [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7138.08s)]
*  that with Marsha? Just like, let's go get five assholes. And that's, that'll be the nucleus of [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7142.64s)]
*  our team. I don't know the answer to this. Cause again, I don't know the sports super well, [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7149.12s)]
*  but it feels like, you know, we've touched on this a bit in the last few years. I feel like the NBA [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7152.88s)]
*  playoffs is very different than the regular season for a bunch of obvious reasons, but like [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7158.4s)]
*  some of the shooting variants, I wonder, like, could you trick yourself into thinking that [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7162.5599999999995s)]
*  you're this really good offense? But then all of a sudden it's like, yeah, but like those guys [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7166.639999999999s)]
*  just aren't going to be as comfortable. And I mean, again, OKC, a lot of these threes were [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7172.32s)]
*  wide open and these guys didn't make them and it still didn't matter. They didn't make them enough. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7177.28s)]
*  Even wide open corner threes. Yeah. And then you could see like, I mean, not to recap game seven [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7182.4s)]
*  again, but Jalen Williams had one where he passed up an open one to throw it to door. And I'm like, [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7188.48s)]
*  dude, what? Like you had 40 the other night. Yeah. Like, what is that? And he responded and he closed [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7193.12s)]
*  well, but do hockey GMs have to think about like, I need a completely like different team that [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7200.879999999999s)]
*  survives advancing through the chaos of the NHL playoffs? Like, hey, we may not be the best [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7210.16s)]
*  offense. We may not be all of these things, but at least we have like the right personalities. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7215.36s)]
*  And maybe I'm just telling hockey people what they've already known and this isn't a secret. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7219.04s)]
*  I think they must think about it. Yeah, but it must. Is it the biggest gap? Like football's [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7222.32s)]
*  pretty straightforward. Baseball is a total coin toss. Like you can talk about how valuable [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7227.28s)]
*  pitching was. I remember like all I would do is look at the pitching matchups for every single [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7231.92s)]
*  playoff series. And then all these times it didn't really matter. The Braves would have had more [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7236.48s)]
*  World Series, right? It's just baseball is just so fucking weird in the playoffs. But hockey [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7240.879999999999s)]
*  feels like a real departure of like, we can have this really good team, but we need these kinds of [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7246.719999999999s)]
*  personalities that may not show up or may not be as valuable in the regular season. Because obviously [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7252.5599999999995s)]
*  Florida checked all those boxes at the last two years. Well, and the goal, you have to have the [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7257.12s)]
*  goal. It starts with that, which is that was Edmonton's biggest failure in the last couple [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7261.599999999999s)]
*  years. But I didn't think it was really a skin. I didn't think it was a skinner. Like I didn't look [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7265.84s)]
*  at this finals and go, oh, well, you know, once again, it's Skinner's fault. And then obviously, [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7270.32s)]
*  I know. But it was, I mean, when you're in there, yeah, you're, you're swapping dudes in and out. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7275.2s)]
*  It's usually not an awesome sign. Yeah, but I could name, I could name like 10 plus guys [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7282.24s)]
*  from the Panthers that I'd be like, oh, that guy did this and this guy had this game. And then Ryan, [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7286.88s)]
*  of course, closes it out. Rodriguez, like all these other dudes that aren't Sam Bennett, [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7290.96s)]
*  really, right. Can't send them. There's so many dudes that you could name. There are so many times [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7295.52s)]
*  like you mentioned the Evander Kane thing as like, I almost made it to bias Harris joke, [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7300.88s)]
*  like he's on the Oilers. There's just a lot of dudes that we know the names because we've been [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7304.8s)]
*  watching the playoffs with them in these last two deep runs. But to just the very casual drive by [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7309.84s)]
*  fan that I am, there's a lot of guys that were on the Oilers. Right? I can't remember, like that [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7315.84s)]
*  guy ever having a moment that stood out. The Canada not winning a Stanley Cup since 93 is [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7320.88s)]
*  one of the craziest streaks in sports. It really is. It's just nuts. 32 years. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7326.8s)]
*  And the last time they won, they beat Gretzky and the Kings, which was like, you know, one of the [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7334.96s)]
*  most important finals, at least in America in the last 40 years. It's like Sam Malone, not getting [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7339.4400000000005s)]
*  laid for a year. That was a, I think that was an episode. You know, do you know Voodoo? It's like [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7344.24s)]
*  it turned into a fan dango. It's like a streaming movie, TV service. I thought you meant you can [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7353.28s)]
*  rent arts. No, you can rent and buy movies on it. Sometimes they have these sales. They had the [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7357.84s)]
*  entire cheer series streaming for 29.99. I was like, fine, that'll come in, hand out an airplane. Why [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7363.04s)]
*  not switch out the blue race? It's just like, who knows? It's how many seasons was it? It was like [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7371.36s)]
*  11 seasons. It's like over 200 episodes. Fine. 30 bucks. Twist my arm. I'll do it. We almost called [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7379.5199999999995s)]
*  you for the Die Hard with a Vengeance rewatchables on Friday, but I knew you were at Elite 11. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7389.92s)]
*  Yeah, went down to Elite 11. I had a busy day. What was it? Why was I so busy that day? [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7395.52s)]
*  I have a Elite 11. You love a Elite 11. I do. We have to go. We're over the two hour mark. I feel [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7403.76s)]
*  bad for Gahau and Eduardo. Thank you for producing the pod for us, guys. Thanks to Zach Lowe for [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7409.04s)]
*  stopping by. Another season of the books for us. Thanks to everybody on YouTube who watched this. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7414.400000000001s)]
*  And you're going to be doing a bunch of stuff this week. We love the draft. Hopefully we'll [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7419.28s)]
*  get some more trades. Brasillo, good to see you. Thanks, Bill. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYEWJ9k7Y8&t=7423.76s)]
