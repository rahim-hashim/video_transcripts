# The 2025 Made-Up NBA Awards With Ryen Russillo | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU)
*  We did this last year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=0.0s)]
*  I had a fantastic time. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1.2s)]
*  We're doing it again. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2.48s)]
*  Have a bunch of awards. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  I couldn't remember last year if I sent you all the nominees. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=5.8s)]
*  I don't think I did. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=8.16s)]
*  I think I just sent you the awards and left you on your own to come up with like [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=8.88s)]
*  a winner, but I have nominees for each category, so we're going to rip through them. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  And the first one is unicorn of the year, which went by Niyama one last year. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=16.52s)]
*  We created it for him. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=21.48s)]
*  He got hurt. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=22.56s)]
*  I don't think we say he's eligible. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=23.32s)]
*  I mean, he could basically win every year. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=25.36s)]
*  I'd like to come up with a new name for this. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=27.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=30.159999999999997s)]
*  Can we, can we, can we zag a little? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=30.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  I mean, unicorn is like, who was the OG unicorn? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=34.72s)]
*  Will Chamberlain. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=40.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=41.76s)]
*  Hey, I saw something the other day. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=42.96s)]
*  They were trying to say you could bench 500 pounds. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=44.0s)]
*  Did you find that in any of your research? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=45.68s)]
*  That would be really impressive. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=47.68s)]
*  I haven't seen that one yet. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=48.68s)]
*  500 pounds is a lot. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=49.2s)]
*  A lot, especially with long arms. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=50.8s)]
*  Really strong guy. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  Nominees I have. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=54.2s)]
*  Wemby again, I'm in Thompson, Lebron and age 40 Dyson, Daniels, or Zach [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=55.32s)]
*  Edie for unicorn of the year, we could just vote for Wemby again. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=61.32s)]
*  No chat. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=65.92s)]
*  Didn't play enough. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=66.8s)]
*  Not eligible. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=67.48s)]
*  What do you need? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=68.68s)]
*  35 games. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=69.08s)]
*  Can put chat in there. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=70.68s)]
*  Make the case. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  If they have a playoff run and he plays as well as I think he's going to play, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=75.0s)]
*  there's going to be some real chat conversations. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  I don't know if they get as absurd as Deandre eight and potentially being a top [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=80.2s)]
*  15 player in the sun's finals run of a few years ago. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  That seems inaccurate with further information, but the rim protection [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=86.4s)]
*  numbers, the fact that he can play five out, the fact that he goes coast to coast [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=93.44s)]
*  the other night against Detroit and then three points shooting. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=98.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  So I, I just, Hey, just tell them the world, prepare yourself for some big [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=102.6s)]
*  time chat projections if okay. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  See, pulls this off. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  I like the chat one. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=113.24s)]
*  If we can't give it to Wemby, I think chat is a good backup choice. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=114.4s)]
*  Cause I've never really seen another player like him. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  So I think you're right. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=120.4s)]
*  I wanted to give this to Amen Thompson, but I feel like he's been in the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=121.8s)]
*  vicinity of other guys we watch, but I still feel like to have enough athletic [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=125.04s)]
*  ability that people go to see you play basketball and you seem like a better [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=129.68s)]
*  athlete than anyone at a basketball game with all the best athletes feels unicorn. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=134.76s)]
*  It's an, so at least he's a medalist. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=139.08s)]
*  So we'll give it to him. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=141.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=142.12s)]
*  But just, just as an aside, a man's like four of these for me. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=142.76s)]
*  And then I had to figure out how to whittle it down. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=146.64s)]
*  So I don't think a man's a bad choice. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=148.6s)]
*  I would say Michael Phelps in the summer Olympics one year, just grabbing metals. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=151.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=155.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=156.32s)]
*  Although I do think if you had basketball where it was like, Hey, we'll [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=156.52s)]
*  play one on one, two on two, three on three, five on five, and then we'll [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=159.44s)]
*  play horse and then it's like Jordan had seven golds, so some of the swimming [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=163.48s)]
*  and gymnastics gold medal count, I think is unfair to the team guys, but we can [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=170.0s)]
*  get into that later, although this curling thing with China is nuts. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=174.28s)]
*  Um, I have, if you had an award for most rewinds on the season, it's. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=177.84s)]
*  Oh, that'd be a good category for next year. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=185.36s)]
*  I always thought the team, like the basketball basketball team [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=187.68s)]
*  medal just should have been bigger. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=190.76000000000002s)]
*  I think when you're just talking about some of those individuals, swimming [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=193.24s)]
*  race ones, maybe a smaller one. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=195.64000000000001s)]
*  And then the basketball, I always thought should look like a flavor [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=197.52s)]
*  flame type of metal next category. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=200.52s)]
*  The 2011 Blake Griffin award for most unexpected delay. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=203.68s)]
*  Once again, I'm at Thompson. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=208.72s)]
*  Here he is along with Kate Cunningham, rejuvenated Jimmy Butler on golden [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=211.72s)]
*  state, Austin Reeves, or anyone else you want to mention any other nominees? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=216.36s)]
*  Nope. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=223.84s)]
*  Cause you already said the guy that I was going to use in this one. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=224.2s)]
*  So who is it? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  Who's your winner? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=229.2s)]
*  I'm in. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=230.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=232.28s)]
*  This is going to be like a Meryl Streep situation here. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=235.48s)]
*  No, because I'm giving mine to Austin Reeves. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=238.68s)]
*  That's a good one. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=243.04s)]
*  I, uh, I can't believe how good he is offensively to the point where he's [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=244.32s)]
*  to the point where he's on a team with LeBron and Luca. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=252.0s)]
*  And not only does his coach think it's a good idea to run stuff through Austin [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=255.48000000000002s)]
*  Reeves, but LeBron and Luca are like, we should run stuff through Austin Reeves. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  Like that's the level he's at. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=262.2s)]
*  I think he's a potential 25 point a game score at some point in his career. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=263.52000000000004s)]
*  Um, there's pieces of different guys from over the years. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=268.72s)]
*  And I'm going to do the, uh, comparing a white guy to a white guy thing, but [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=272.84000000000003s)]
*  there's a lot of Jeff Hornacek. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=276.12s)]
*  Um, there's some Paul Westfall. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=278.56s)]
*  But his ability to get to the basket, create shots for other guys, uh, take [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=281.44s)]
*  huge threes and big moments. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  I think other teams are really afraid of him offensively. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=288.32s)]
*  Um, I've been really impressed. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=292.08s)]
*  Was not expecting it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=295.44s)]
*  And so it's either him or Thompson to me. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=296.56s)]
*  Save on men for some of the other ones. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=301.47999999999996s)]
*  Cause I think the Reeves part of it is you're not saying it's unexpected [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=303.44s)]
*  cause we already knew he was pretty good. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=309.44s)]
*  But now this is like the Jalen Brown arc where you have to keep adjusting [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=311.08s)]
*  the ceiling every time. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=314.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=316.59999999999997s)]
*  I just didn't, I never thought like I was like them. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=317.35999999999996s)]
*  I never thought like this guy might be a four time all star. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=320.03999999999996s)]
*  Like I was never in my head. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=323.47999999999996s)]
*  It was always like, Oh, this guy's a really nice piece for Lebron. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=324.8s)]
*  Like he really turned out to be a good player. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=327.24s)]
*  Somebody should pay him. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=328.79999999999995s)]
*  Now it's like, Jesus Christ, this guy, this is like a real, a real offensive star. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=329.59999999999997s)]
*  You know what's crazy? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=335.56s)]
*  Like, do you remember, do you remember the spurs thing, not offering him a contract? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=336.36s)]
*  Oh, shut up. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=339.4s)]
*  Uh, I didn't tell you this category because we already have the winner, but it's a [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=340.56s)]
*  new category for next year. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=346.28000000000003s)]
*  The Luca dachas trade award for most cataclysmic NBA moment of the season [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=348.36s)]
*  goes to Luca trade. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=353.08000000000004s)]
*  So we just have to write that one down for next year. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=357.28000000000003s)]
*  There's no way we're, I mean, you can sit there and say plenty of [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=358.08000000000004s)]
*  unexpected things happen. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=361.48s)]
*  How about Cuban now doing the tour? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=362.6s)]
*  Oh, he's coming up later. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=364.68s)]
*  Oh, all right. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=366.6s)]
*  I didn't even realize that was the category. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=367.08000000000004s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=368.72s)]
*  Um, the 1986 bill Walton award for biggest impact under 20 minutes, a game guy [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=369.76s)]
*  nominees, Ty Jerome over Silla podcast guests, 19.7 minutes a game this year, 12.2 [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=378.2s)]
*  points a game, Lou Cornett on the Celtics putting up basically like a six, six and [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=383.88s)]
*  15 minutes, OB Toppin 10 and four, 37% from three leads the league and a field goal [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=388.71999999999997s)]
*  percentage around the rim. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=397.6s)]
*  And then just for fuck's sake, Ben Simmons on the Quippers, let's throw him into for [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=399.40000000000003s)]
*  when he comes in and does whatever Ben Simmons does for 15 minutes. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=403.72s)]
*  Uh, who do you have for the bill Walton award? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=407.64000000000004s)]
*  Todd Jerome, the metrics for a player like him are incredible. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=410.16s)]
*  He's it's also real when you watch it. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=414.88s)]
*  So, I mean, his wind shares per 48 is over two, like 0.2. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=418.16s)]
*  So it's, it's a really good number, which sometimes that number doesn't even show [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=422.16s)]
*  up to reflect how well, you know, but when you start kind of getting into that area [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=426.88s)]
*  for a player, especially what he's asked to do, uh, I think it's Jerome. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=430.96s)]
*  And I think he's had some really big moments for them. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=435.24s)]
*  I was really felt like there was a few weeks there where it was just like, so this [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=437.04s)]
*  guy's just never going to miss any shots and do everything right. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=439.68s)]
*  It's one of the best under 20 minute seasons in a while. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=442.8s)]
*  You know, he's basically coming in for two nine minutes stretches each half and [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=447.24s)]
*  that's it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=450.68s)]
*  You don't see him again. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=451.04s)]
*  And he comes in and he's impactful the whole time. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=452.04s)]
*  Um, I'm with you. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=454.56s)]
*  What does he make this summer? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=456.64s)]
*  You think see a 15 to $16 million guy? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=457.59999999999997s)]
*  God, not a shitload of cap space floating around. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=463.67999999999995s)]
*  No, but not a great free agent field either. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=467.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=470.23999999999995s)]
*  Veteran guy is going to be in some big games in the playoffs. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=471.56s)]
*  I think you could see like a 50 for three. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=475.23999999999995s)]
*  One of those types of deals from somebody. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=477.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=481.12s)]
*  Cause you're still asking like. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=482.56s)]
*  You're going, is he going to be our starting point guard? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=487.12s)]
*  Like, is he playing 36 minutes a night out there? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=489.76s)]
*  Well, could he get like the one of those streus contracts? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=492.52s)]
*  Like when streus went to Cleveland, what was it? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=494.79999999999995s)]
*  Four 64. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=497.23999999999995s)]
*  And they were like, we just need an awesome role player who can make some [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=498.32s)]
*  shots and play swing and maybe he starts. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=501.32s)]
*  Maybe he comes off the bench, but we need him very excited for the next category. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=503.56s)]
*  The Monte Williams award for worst coach of the year. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=510.91999999999996s)]
*  This used to be named the Vinny Del Nega award until whatever Monte did last year, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=513.72s)]
*  which was the most egregious bad coaching I think we've ever had this century. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=517.88s)]
*  At least nominees coach bud on the Phoenix sense, Nick nurse on the Sixers. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=522.16s)]
*  I'm throwing Doug Christie in here as a nominee based on the last 15 Kings [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=530.9200000000001s)]
*  games and just whatever the hell is going on with that team. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=535.0s)]
*  They're four and 11 in their last 15, not trying to tank. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=537.2s)]
*  Uh, anybody else you would put in as a nominee here? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=540.64s)]
*  How was nurse on here? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=543.6s)]
*  I just put them on from the first two months of the season. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=545.72s)]
*  I needed nominees. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=549.48s)]
*  I'm going to zag on you. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=551.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=553.4s)]
*  Toronto. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=554.88s)]
*  Ryukovic. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=556.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=557.64s)]
*  Now, not because he did a bad job, but because he did an amazing job. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=558.64s)]
*  This is the worst tanking in a bad way. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=562.36s)]
*  Like if the goal were to tank, they were eight and 31. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=567.24s)]
*  They were unbelievably defensively. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=570.96s)]
*  They're for like two plus months. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=572.48s)]
*  They won too many games. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=574.4s)]
*  Um, so he was, I'm not saying he's a bad coach, but he did the worst job of [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=576.4s)]
*  executing cause the team played so hard. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=580.4s)]
*  And I think the Raptors were number two against the spread. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=581.84s)]
*  And depending on what number you got this summer, they're going to end up being. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=584.5600000000001s)]
*  An over team, which I throw away than the last four games. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=588.8000000000001s)]
*  I think they played too hard. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=593.9200000000001s)]
*  So I'm, I'm not even comparing them to Monte Williams, but I'm zagging [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=595.28s)]
*  a bit on the nomination of like, Hey, what? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=598.0s)]
*  Why are you getting these like, there's certain nights with their [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=600.44s)]
*  lineups where I'd go, what the hell is in, then they'd win again. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=603.0400000000001s)]
*  I'm going to pick coach bud because, uh, Phoenix seems the most uninspired [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=607.5200000000001s)]
*  night tonight with the most guys that really don't seem like they gave a [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=613.72s)]
*  shit about what happens in the game. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=617.5600000000001s)]
*  I thought Bradley Beals performance in the Celtics game the other night was [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=619.24s)]
*  one of the most reprehensible things I've seen in a while. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=623.6400000000001s)]
*  And I really hope if anyone missed it, go to the Celtics. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=625.84s)]
*  And I really hope if anyone missed it, go, go watch some of his minutes in that [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=628.56s)]
*  game, and, uh, if you want to see somebody just completely mail it in, it was, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=632.76s)]
*  it was awful. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=636.56s)]
*  Did you see it? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=637.4s)]
*  It was awful. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=639.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=640.0799999999999s)]
*  He's, I mean, there shouldn't even be any other nominees for another award a [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=640.7199999999999s)]
*  little bit later, I imagine we're aligned in that. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=643.56s)]
*  Well, I had the 2015 Brad Stevens award for most untankable coach. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=645.92s)]
*  And I had your Toronto guy, Jordy Fernandez, Will Hardy, and Chauncey [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=651.04s)]
*  Billups action pack category. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=654.16s)]
*  So you'd go the Toronto guy for that one too. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=656.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=659.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=659.92s)]
*  I didn't know that was a category, so I wouldn't have done that to you. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=660.0799999999999s)]
*  No, no, I, I, I think he can win both. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=662.68s)]
*  Um, has anyone ever done that before? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=665.64s)]
*  A double, a double. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=667.8s)]
*  I have Jordy. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=669.16s)]
*  They're just like trying to trade dudes, get guys off the team to make them worse. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=670.2399999999999s)]
*  And that team over and over again, every, it's same thing as Toronto. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=675.1199999999999s)]
*  Everyone plays hard. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=678.0s)]
*  He's a really good in game coach and he's just stolen games left and right. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=679.4399999999999s)]
*  So kudos to him. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=683.56s)]
*  Speaking of Chauncey Billups, the late 1990s Chauncey Billups award for best [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=685.0s)]
*  reason, never to sell your stock. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=690.0799999999999s)]
*  Our guy scoot Anderson. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=693.16s)]
*  That's it. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=697.9599999999999s)]
*  There's no other nominees scoot Anderson. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=698.4s)]
*  I was talking to a team this morning about this and their quote. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=701.5999999999999s)]
*  So it's not coming from me, but was that this, we need to have more [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=706.4799999999999s)]
*  patience with guards the way you have to think the game now with the number of [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=710.12s)]
*  defenses that you're seeing, it's almost like quarterbacking now. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=714.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=717.1600000000001s)]
*  Are they in zone? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=717.4000000000001s)]
*  Is the safety coming down as all this different stuff? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=718.12s)]
*  Like there's just so much variation for what you're having to face. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=720.2800000000001s)]
*  And I think Kate Cunningham is a great example of this. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=726.2s)]
*  Like you saw the physical talent. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=728.2s)]
*  You imagine he was going to be able to shoot it well. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=730.08s)]
*  And then at that size of the passing that we saw from Oklahoma state, it's [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=731.96s)]
*  like how this just isn't going to work out. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=735.08s)]
*  Now, granted he had some really alarming numbers finishing at the rim or his [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=737.36s)]
*  inability to finish at the rim, but you saw clearly in it helped them having [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=740.64s)]
*  spacing too, but once he started kind of figuring things out a little bit, it [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=745.0400000000001s)]
*  just, there might be a lesson in there for some of these lottery pick guards [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=748.52s)]
*  that look lost early on. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=751.9200000000001s)]
*  Um, so maybe there's a scoot lesson in there as well. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=754.52s)]
*  I'm going to go backwards to two guys. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=758.88s)]
*  I specifically mentioned remember for this because this might've always been a [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=760.84s)]
*  lesson and we just forgot Kevin Johnson, Kevin Johnson on Cleveland. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=764.48s)]
*  I remember going to a cab Celtics game and watching him just look like a deer [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=769.16s)]
*  in the headlights. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=773.92s)]
*  I went with my dad and we were like, wow, that guy seemed like a bust. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=774.8s)]
*  And then they traded him for Larry Nansen. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=780.52s)]
*  He was awesome. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=782.12s)]
*  And then billups on Boston. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=783.3199999999999s)]
*  I was going to those games. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=785.1999999999999s)]
*  Now, Patina was yelling at everybody. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=786.96s)]
*  He lost his confidence. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=789.0s)]
*  They traded him after 50 games and then he bounced around and went to Denver. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=790.04s)]
*  He went to Toronto. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=793.28s)]
*  Toronto. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=795.5600000000001s)]
*  Like he bounced around before he finally landed on Minnesota when he rejuvenated [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=796.2800000000001s)]
*  his career, but, um, I would just never give up on a high pick after a year or [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=800.5600000000001s)]
*  two, if I was a team that drafted them. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=808.12s)]
*  Quarterbacks a little different. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=810.44s)]
*  We've had some quarterbacks where it's like, I mean, when did we know Josh Rosen? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=811.64s)]
*  Like, like the second play of his career where it's just like, ah, that [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=815.36s)]
*  guy's it's a, I wasn't that quick on Josh Rosen. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=819.0400000000001s)]
*  So you weren't, you stayed in, how long did you stay? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=822.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=825.08s)]
*  Longer. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=826.5200000000001s)]
*  Cause I think it was a game against, I forget if it was SC or maybe it was [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=827.24s)]
*  Arizona where I thought he was reading the blitz perfectly and hitting the tight end. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=832.44s)]
*  So yeah, I fell for it. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=836.1600000000001s)]
*  Terrell Brandon, maybe part of this group. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=839.4000000000001s)]
*  That's a good one. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=843.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=844.4000000000001s)]
*  Even somebody like Brian Shaw, who was really up and down and then turned into [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=845.64s)]
*  an awesome role player for a couple of different playoff teams. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=849.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=852.2s)]
*  I like your quarter. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=852.5600000000001s)]
*  I like your quarterback point guard thing. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=853.2800000000001s)]
*  The Freeman Williams award for biggest black hole. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=854.72s)]
*  This isn't as fun as last year when cam Thomas was just the obvious winner. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=857.24s)]
*  Um, I went with Lamelo, which you made the case for on your pod a couple of [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=861.4399999999999s)]
*  months ago, but even though he's 21.3 field goal attempts a game in 32 minutes. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=866.72s)]
*  So he's basically taking two shots every three minutes. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=873.48s)]
*  He's got a 36 usage rate and the team doesn't win. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=876.88s)]
*  So I don't feel great about it, but I thought he was the best option. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=879.4399999999999s)]
*  Who'd you have? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=882.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=882.6800000000001s)]
*  Cause there's some an alarm, like alarming shot numbers that we've gone over where [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=884.0s)]
*  it was the most shots, I think per 100 possessions since Kobe in 2006. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=889.44s)]
*  And it's like, okay. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=893.88s)]
*  But I mean, there was even discussions then of like, okay, Kobe's amazing, but [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=895.16s)]
*  is this awesome? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=900.24s)]
*  You know, and again, like how dare you even bring it up. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=902.24s)]
*  And then you mentioned the team around him and all that kind of stuff. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=905.08s)]
*  Even if I feel like everybody would be guest bill, like, Hey, we're still, is [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=907.84s)]
*  going to jump on this Lamello thing because of that stuff that you're already [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=911.0799999999999s)]
*  talking about. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=913.52s)]
*  He's such a good passer that I don't think the black hole thing applies to him. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=914.4s)]
*  Like I have to be, I have to watch you and think you never want to pass. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=918.12s)]
*  Do you just want to, and I think Lamello actually wants to pass a ton. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=922.36s)]
*  I mean, there's a sneaky part of this circling back to the start of the pod [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=926.56s)]
*  where we're talking about Cooper and where he could go. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=929.88s)]
*  They can, you imagine him on lobs from Lamello. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=932.12s)]
*  Like, what, you know, is there a version of this Lamello thing where it works, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=935.16s)]
*  where he scales down the shot attempts a little, he has some better players. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=938.84s)]
*  Like, you know, I, again, I'm, I'm probably, I sound like I'm in the marketing [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=942.2800000000001s)]
*  room with the front office of the Hornets going, Hey, right, right. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=946.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=951.36s)]
*  We have, we have someone, we didn't want to give them up. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=951.8000000000001s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=954.6s)]
*  Uh, couple, couple options for you here. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=955.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=958.52s)]
*  Delano Blanton from Portland. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=962.2s)]
*  I was like, that guy doesn't like passing. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=964.8000000000001s)]
*  He really doesn't, but then his assist percentage number on the advanced stuff [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=967.0s)]
*  was so much higher than I thought it would be. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=971.44s)]
*  I was like, that's, that's not the numbers. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=973.84s)]
*  Don't back up the eyes on that, but I'm just telling you that guy's not, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=977.12s)]
*  he's thinking shoot first. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=979.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=981.4s)]
*  If you've watched, if you've watched enough Portland, which, you know, some [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=981.64s)]
*  of us like watching Portland play. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=984.28s)]
*  Uh, so then I looked at top 15 in field goal attempts, not per game, just raw [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=986.28s)]
*  field goal attempt total. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=992.32s)]
*  I did the same. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=993.88s)]
*  Jalen greens fourth. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=994.8s)]
*  He's taking the fourth most shots this season in the league. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=996.04s)]
*  Uh, and look, yeah, Jalen was awesome the other night against Ocase. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=999.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1002.9599999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1003.2399999999999s)]
*  So I've been impressed. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1003.4799999999999s)]
*  They need them. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1005.4799999999999s)]
*  But if you go by the 1,394 shots, that's again, 1,394 shots this year. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1006.4399999999999s)]
*  So I looked at it, it was like, all right, who, let's say top 15 shot [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1011.64s)]
*  attempt guys total on the season. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1015.2399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1018.3199999999999s)]
*  The only one he's the only one under 300 assists. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1018.4799999999999s)]
*  The Rosen is the only one close to him at three 16 and Jalen's at like two 60 something. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1021.7199999999999s)]
*  Now you could also say, Hey, scale it out to 16 field goal attempts and then [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1027.0s)]
*  Jaren Jackson Jr, who I love, like it's, but then I go, okay, but nobody's giving [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1033.8s)]
*  it to Jaren Jackson Jr saying, all right, now set up the offense. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1038.76s)]
*  Maybe we don't have a black hole. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1041.36s)]
*  Maybe the words defunct. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1043.6399999999999s)]
*  I looked at the research numbers. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1045.8s)]
*  There was a lot of research. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1047.44s)]
*  Reset. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1049.2s)]
*  I looked at the research numbers. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1049.48s)]
*  There was high volume. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1050.96s)]
*  I was surprised. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1052.8400000000001s)]
*  But what are you asked to do? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1054.2s)]
*  But when you start getting into like 7% assist ratio, like Jordan [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1055.5600000000002s)]
*  Clarkson had some years, you're like, man, not a lot of playmaking there. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1059.7600000000002s)]
*  So some of it feels a little bit like, okay, but once the ball is passed to me, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1065.0400000000002s)]
*  what are you more meaning you and I, like, what do you morons expect me to do? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1070.44s)]
*  Like you realize how I fit into our offense. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1073.8000000000002s)]
*  Like I'm not, not getting the ball to set it back up. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1075.7600000000002s)]
*  So I think it has to be on somebody who's you're still expecting to [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1078.48s)]
*  maybe make a few plays here and there. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1081.4s)]
*  Camp Thomas's stats are basically almost exactly the same as last year. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1084.84s)]
*  So he's probably the winner, even though I feel, I felt way better watching him [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1088.32s)]
*  this year than it did last year. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1091.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1093.08s)]
*  We don't really have the. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1093.28s)]
*  That's why even like Lamela, I was like, I don't know. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1095.52s)]
*  Maybe we leave this to funk this year. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1098.72s)]
*  What's a, we got some media where it's coming up. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1101.3600000000001s)]

*  Um, I'm sure you have a couple of nominees written down too. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1156.2s)]
*  I wrote down for. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1158.96s)]
*  Perk saying Steph shouldn't be an all star. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1161.44s)]

*  has been debuting some yolkage stuff lately that I really want to talk about. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1174.8s)]
*  Uh, and then Gilbert Arena saying Bronte would be top five for rookie of the year. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1181.84s)]
*  If you played 36 minutes a game, it was an actual Gilbert Arena steak. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1185.96s)]
*  Is that if you were playing 36 minutes a game, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1190.64s)]
*  I feel like any rookie playing 36 minutes a game is probably in the [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1194.88s)]
*  running for rookie of the year. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1198.0s)]
*  Uh, any other, any other ones that jumped out for you? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1199.4s)]
*  I think about the perk Yoke itch Westbrook video once a week, the [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1205.68s)]
*  stat pad. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1211.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1212.96s)]
*  It's been years. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1213.3600000000001s)]
*  It's been years and I can't stop thinking about it. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1215.0800000000002s)]
*  Every time he talks about yolkage, I can't unwind it. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1218.3999999999999s)]
*  Cause I know what he was doing and there was, there was a video of like, it was [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1223.84s)]
*  kind of like the thinking emoji face. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1230.08s)]
*  And I kept thinking like of all the times that I'll, I'll admit the [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1234.52s)]
*  disconnect of me never playing in any game that ever mattered in the sport [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1240.4399999999998s)]
*  that I'm in love with. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1245.16s)]
*  And it's basically my career. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1246.2s)]
*  And then somebody who did play is capable of suggesting that because one guy gets [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1250.12s)]
*  triple doubles, it's the same as the other guy getting triple doubles. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1255.2s)]
*  I just, it makes my head explode. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1258.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1262.04s)]
*  I can't, I still don't have an answer as to how it even happened. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1262.32s)]
*  So Perks been on a bit of a heater. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1266.56s)]
*  He had SGA and the defensive player of the year conversation the other night [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1269.08s)]
*  when they were talking MVP. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1272.72s)]
*  And it was like, yeah, it was like, why is SGA not being mentioned for [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1274.32s)]
*  defensive player of the year? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1278.8s)]
*  And I thought like, well, cause it's March and we know that he isn't. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1279.72s)]
*  Um, and he's actually, if Wallace isn't on the floor, like the one guy, not to [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1283.52s)]
*  say that he's a bad defensive player, but he's, he's not even like one of the three [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1287.16s)]
*  or four best defensive players on his own team, although he's gotten defensive, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1291.44s)]
*  all defensive team votes. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1295.16s)]
*  I think it was a couple of years ago. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1296.56s)]
*  But yeah, he's got, he's on the same team with Dorton, Caruso and Wallace. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1298.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1301.92s)]
*  So that made me like, I had a relapse on the Yokech Westbrook thing when I was [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1302.44s)]
*  watching that. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1308.36s)]
*  And so then I saw the Mark Marcus Morris stuff with Yokech and I was like, you [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1309.96s)]
*  know, first takes probably sitting there going, is there anybody that we can find [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1313.44s)]
*  that's kind of in the mix, played, not planned, maybe we can figure out if he [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1317.56s)]
*  fits in to what we're doing, but like back different background than Yokech. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1321.96s)]
*  Like, is there anybody available who could come on and just shit on [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1326.6s)]
*  Yokech a little bit? [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1329.0s)]
*  Was there anybody that Yokech shoved from behind really hard and knocked him [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1330.1999999999998s)]
*  out for 20 games? [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1333.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1334.1599999999999s)]
*  It's his brother, but is there anybody, is there anybody that would like fit [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1334.36s)]
*  into what we're doing here? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1338.9199999999998s)]
*  And it's like, I've got the guy. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1341.36s)]
*  I've got the guy. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1344.3999999999999s)]
*  And then he went, they must've been high-fiving him being like, you fit in [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1346.0s)]
*  perfectly to what we're doing. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1349.08s)]
*  So you think that was in the meeting? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1350.6799999999998s)]
*  He, he test drove it and they're like, that's great. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1352.4399999999998s)]
*  You should say that. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1355.0s)]
*  Could you say not top 50? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1356.28s)]
*  Uh, that was really good. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1360.6799999999998s)]
*  Because when I saw the clip, it was like, no way Marcus Morris kind of shit [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1364.52s)]
*  on Yokech a little. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1369.1999999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1370.72s)]
*  Next category is the most shameless LeBron related media moment of the year. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1370.9599999999998s)]
*  And unfortunately there were too many this year with, with people in the media. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1375.24s)]
*  And we're just going to skip this award. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1379.6s)]
*  Um, including a couple last week that I was just stupefied by. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1381.72s)]
*  Um, let's move on. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1385.4399999999998s)]
*  The Virginia beach Kings award for most contrived story on a slow news day. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1390.0s)]
*  I'll give you the nominees. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1397.8799999999999s)]
*  This is, I think another, another action pack. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1399.08s)]
*  Great category. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1401.6s)]
*  Steven a versus LeBron for 10 days. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1403.08s)]
*  The story that Minnesota at the deadline came really close to getting Kevin Durant, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1407.48s)]
*  even though they're on the 13th apron and it's like physically impossible for them [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1412.72s)]
*  to make any sort of trade that would have allowed it. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1417.12s)]
*  I enjoyed that anything, any story that involves an ex player in a podcast, taking [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1419.16s)]
*  a shot at a current player, throwing that in there, any story that made it seem like [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1425.64s)]
*  Joel Embiid was now ramping up to play throwing there. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1430.8400000000001s)]
*  And then, uh, my favorite Paul George has paused his podcast to concentrate on the [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1434.88s)]
*  76 or season. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1440.1200000000001s)]
*  I thought I had no notes. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1442.2s)]
*  I thought that was a tour de force. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1443.52s)]
*  It's the podcast. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1446.72s)]
*  It's the, Oh, somebody view for that. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1448.56s)]
*  What else do you have for most contrived story on a slow news day? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1450.36s)]
*  I'm going to blame myself for this one, but I wrote out a Tumani Kamara open that I [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1454.32s)]
*  didn't do on my pod that you didn't do. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1460.72s)]
*  You were going to do it. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1464.76s)]
*  You knew you were going to come our open. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1466.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1467.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1469.92s)]
*  That was like a tough headline. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1470.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1472.0s)]
*  I probably would have led with the guest on the tweet of that episode. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1472.8799999999999s)]
*  Kamara underrated. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1477.1999999999998s)]
*  Uh, I think my favorite, my favorite contrived story is the Durant trade though. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1481.1999999999998s)]
*  That was my favorite. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1485.7199999999998s)]
*  I can't believe Minnesota was floating that out. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1486.76s)]
*  Like there was ever a chance in a million years. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1488.6799999999998s)]
*  They had a chance to get Kevin Durant when all the rules make it literally impossible. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1490.3999999999999s)]
*  You know what? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1495.6s)]
*  Off of that though, I think we could have bring it back to the Luca thing that we [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1496.04s)]
*  haven't even brought up yet is that when it happened, all we were doing with whatever [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1499.04s)]
*  contacts you had, I was like, did you know he was available? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1505.88s)]
*  And it was like, no, no. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1508.2800000000002s)]
*  Did you hear this? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1509.4s)]
*  No, no, he wasn't. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1510.0s)]
*  He wasn't or whatever. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1511.4s)]
*  And then it like took a couple of weeks. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1512.44s)]
*  No calls. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1514.7600000000002s)]
*  It took a couple of weeks for us to be fed the idea that he was offered for [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1515.8400000000001s)]
*  aunt and that he was offered for Janice. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1519.96s)]
*  And then it became, again, it depends on who you believe. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1523.3200000000002s)]
*  Cause I don't know that any of this stuff was officially reported, but the [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1525.96s)]
*  sense you got from it, I think you and I would agree. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1528.96s)]
*  So I'm assuming a bit here where it was like, yeah, a team called us about a [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1530.96s)]
*  trade, but they didn't say, they didn't say he was available. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1535.56s)]
*  They said, what would it take to get Janice? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1540.84s)]
*  And we were like, what are you talking about? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1542.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1544.28s)]
*  Oh, another big award. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1547.52s)]
*  The McKeskey award for best American white guy. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1550.12s)]
*  Previous winners included Chet Holmgren, Tyler Hero, Kevin Love and Mike Miller. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1554.36s)]
*  So this is a prestigious one. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1559.76s)]
*  Mike Miller actually was close to having the white belt here. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1561.28s)]
*  He had it. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1564.6s)]
*  He won it somewhere in the mid two thousands. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1565.24s)]
*  He grabbed. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1567.68s)]
*  I'm not saying it's wrong, but sometimes it's a weak field. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1568.68s)]
*  This year it's a strong field. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1572.96s)]
*  Chet Holmgren, Tyler Hero, Austin Reeves. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1574.56s)]
*  We'll throw Pritchard in there just to have four candidates, but this is [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1579.2s)]
*  probably the best category we've had now. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1584.08s)]
*  Holmgren's missed a punch of time. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1587.48s)]
*  So I'm going to penalize him and make it between Hero and Reeves. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1589.28s)]
*  And I got to say, I think it's Reeves. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1592.84s)]
*  It's Holmgren if we don't care that he missed the games, cause he's the [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1595.76s)]
*  best out of those guys, but I think if you're going by this season, it's Reeves. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1598.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1603.8s)]
*  But just to review, Jokic, Caitlin Clark, American white guys, Trump, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1604.0s)]
*  Cooper flag, white Lotus. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1612.88s)]
*  Been a big year. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1616.44s)]
*  Flag was a hit last night. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1618.64s)]
*  So you agree that it's it's Reeves or would you go home green on 30 games? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1620.0s)]
*  God, this was a really tough cat. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1629.36s)]
*  I think there was a time where we were wondering if McDermott was the answer. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1630.68s)]
*  We had bad years for this. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1634.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1636.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1636.72s)]
*  Like that's why I just gave you that timeline. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1636.96s)]
*  What's been going on. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1638.8s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1641.24s)]
*  I'll go Chet ceiling, but if you want to ding them for next year, I'll go [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1644.4s)]
*  Chet ceiling, but if you want to ding them for not playing what he's at 29 games [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1647.72s)]
*  and Reeves has had to really carry. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1652.24s)]
*  You're right. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1655.1599999999999s)]
*  Chet's the best out of those guys. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1655.6s)]
*  We don't have the all NBA rules where it's 55 games or more. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1657.72s)]
*  We're just going best white guy. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1661.36s)]
*  He's the best white guy. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1662.56s)]
*  Dennis Rodman award for best ongoing distraction. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1663.8799999999999s)]
*  Nominees and bead. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1667.48s)]
*  What's going on with this knee? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1670.32s)]
*  Is he going to play today? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1671.28s)]
*  Uh-oh. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1672.32s)]
*  Setback. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1672.6399999999999s)]
*  Oh, he's ramping up. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1673.36s)]
*  Ah, setback. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1674.3999999999999s)]
*  Oh, he's ramping up. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1675.32s)]
*  Zion. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1677.1200000000001s)]
*  Is he playing? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1678.8400000000001s)]
*  Oh, he's hurt. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1679.96s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1680.64s)]
*  He had 38 points and 17 rebounds last night. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1681.0800000000002s)]
*  Where is he? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1683.8400000000001s)]
*  He's not there anymore. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1684.24s)]
*  John Moran. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1685.8400000000001s)]
*  Jimmy Butler in Miami, not the Jimmy Butler in Golden State. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1687.92s)]
*  Jimmy Butler, Miami. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1691.48s)]
*  And then last one. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1692.5600000000002s)]
*  Here's where I'm going to put our guy Mark Cuban for his, it's not my fault [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1694.0800000000002s)]
*  media tour, um, after probably two weeks of getting hammered by ruin in Dallas. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1697.8400000000001s)]
*  Why did you trade Luka Dodge? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1703.96s)]
*  I just haven't been explaining that they didn't. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1705.3200000000002s)]
*  He finally felt the need to give multiple interviews, uh, rubbing salt into [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1706.8s)]
*  the, uh, open wound of the Luka trade. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1712.24s)]
*  So who do you have for this best ongoing distraction? [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1714.4s)]
*  Biggest. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1717.68s)]
*  There's such a recency bias with awards. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1719.68s)]
*  I think Jimmy Butler needs to be recognized here. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1721.56s)]
*  I think you're right. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1726.48s)]
*  It's because it started, it started the playoffs last year. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1727.24s)]
*  Yep. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1730.52s)]
*  I think you're right. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1731.48s)]
*  Plus watching how great of a teammate and contributor and the way the [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1732.04s)]
*  gold state guys are talking about him, how amazing he is. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1736.2s)]
*  And he can score nine points, have five rebounds and still impact [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1739.08s)]
*  the game in these 19 ways. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1742.48s)]
*  And Steph loves him. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1744.04s)]
*  Draymond loves him. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1745.36s)]
*  Kurt loves him. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1746.16s)]
*  I think it's the right answer. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1747.48s)]
*  He was slow though, in that Lakers game. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1750.32s)]
*  And it was something that maybe I wouldn't notice as much if I wasn't there, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1752.32s)]
*  but he, he basically took off like, I think the first 14 minutes. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1756.0s)]
*  It was so range. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1762.48s)]
*  I think he's played a lot of minutes, the last 25 games in a way that hasn't [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1765.64s)]
*  really happened in a while and it, I I've noticed a little bit of the same thing [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1772.2s)]
*  that it seems like he's a little bit dead legsy, but you know, they're in the [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1776.32s)]
*  grind now they're trying to get, trying to get a top three, top four seed. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1780.44s)]
*  I don't think they have any choice. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1783.72s)]
*  I was surprised he played on Friday night, but I think these guys, you know, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1784.76s)]
*  at this point, it's such a dramatic difference to be three or four versus [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1788.76s)]
*  falling down that eight is the scary one. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1792.88s)]
*  Nobody wants to be eight. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1795.96s)]
*  People will play these guys and back to backs, whatever they don't, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1797.3200000000002s)]
*  nobody wants to be it. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1800.3600000000001s)]
*  So that's it. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1801.92s)]
*  Oh, the Jim Coughlin award. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1803.96s)]
*  For you think you're better than me. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1807.24s)]
*  Uh, last year, this was won by the LeBron JJ pod. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1809.0800000000002s)]
*  I guess we could give it to the Nash LeBron pod this year to mind the game. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1813.72s)]
*  I don't know if you had any other candidates. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1818.08s)]
*  I've learned to love Shaq. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1821.04s)]
*  I didn't really appreciate him when I was younger. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1822.6s)]
*  I guess I did from a basketball sense, but I was never necessarily like rooting [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1826.12s)]
*  for him and I think at that point, once he was at the Lakers, I was certainly [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1829.84s)]
*  more into my Commonwealth phase. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1833.8799999999999s)]
*  So it wasn't likely that I was going to root for him. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1837.3999999999999s)]
*  So I've learned to love him. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1839.84s)]
*  He feels incredibly sincere, you know, somebody that's a public figure, his [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1842.52s)]
*  honesty, the way he's talked about stuff. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1847.08s)]
*  But I mean, just, I'd say you think you're better than me would be Shaq against [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1848.6399999999999s)]
*  anyone that's currently playing. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1852.0s)]
*  Like he just can't help himself and we'll have these games that are just [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1853.36s)]
*  incredible performances. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1858.08s)]
*  And then somehow the conversation just pivots back to that they couldn't guard [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1859.48s)]
*  him. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1863.32s)]
*  And if I were a producer, I'd go, dude, you have figured it out. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1864.1599999999999s)]
*  You're great on this show. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1867.8799999999999s)]
*  It was a really tough show to come into. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1868.92s)]
*  You know, in the beginning, I thought was Shaq that it was bad. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1870.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1873.84s)]
*  Is this going to work? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1874.28s)]
*  Is he looking at those other two guys being like, I was a better player than [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1875.36s)]
*  you, so I should be a bigger star than you. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1877.96s)]
*  But it's like, hey, Charles, it's just the star of the show. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1879.4399999999998s)]
*  And then everybody kind of plays off of that. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1881.32s)]
*  And for whatever reason, like it almost feels so important that they developed [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1883.28s)]
*  him. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1887.2s)]
*  Like they've, he's done a great job developing himself on television, developing [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1887.52s)]
*  himself on television, everybody behind the scenes. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1890.72s)]
*  Like it's, it's really important that he's there. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1892.8799999999999s)]
*  And I would say to him, if I were on the show, it'd be like, just be like, be [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1895.84s)]
*  cautious of playing the same note over and over again, especially when you have a [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1899.8799999999999s)]
*  night in the NBA that's like, should be celebrated. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1903.72s)]
*  It's good. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1907.92s)]
*  Oh, this is a great one. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1911.28s)]
*  The Andre Blatch award for most immediately regrettable extension. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1912.52s)]
*  And somehow we had six nominees, including Joel Embiid. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1916.84s)]
*  I'm throwing Laurie Markkinen in Jamal Murray, throwing him in Brandon Ingram [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1920.68s)]
*  happened during the season, Patrick Williams and Scotty Barnes. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1924.92s)]
*  The answer is obviously Joel Embiid, but it's just fun that we had six [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1929.48s)]
*  nominees and marketing. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1933.2s)]
*  I shoehorned a couple in there that probably weren't that regrettable, but it [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1934.48s)]
*  is Joel Embiid is our answer. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1937.8s)]
*  I'm saving Ingram for something else. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1939.76s)]
*  That's totally fine. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1941.92s)]
*  Um, Markkinen surprise you would nominate, although it's a bit alarming, but I [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1943.76s)]
*  think that team had just so many on ball guys that were young and they were like, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1950.44s)]
*  we want to lose anyway, so we're not going to worry about it. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1953.88s)]
*  Uh, the Patrick Williams one sneaky deserves like a lot of credit here. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1956.96s)]
*  Five for 90. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1961.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1963.52s)]
*  And he's just, he had a dunk that the other night and I was like, this is awesome. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1963.92s)]
*  They were also down 30, I think the Oklahoma city within minutes of the game, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1968.24s)]
*  but the Embiid and the Embiid timeline of it is really why there shouldn't be [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1971.76s)]
*  anybody else receiving votes for this one. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1977.32s)]
*  Would you consider changing the name next year from Andre Blatch to Joel Embiid [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1980.1200000000001s)]
*  award if, uh, if Embiid doesn't come back next year? [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1986.04s)]
*  Or did Andre having an extension that got in the state and making NBA history [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1990.9199999999998s)]
*  that way, well, should that just cement the award for him forever? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1995.6399999999999s)]
*  I have a really soft spot for Andre Blatch. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=1999.9199999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2003.32s)]
*  Like we used to talk about him all the time with Ben Pelt and I did wizards [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2003.96s)]
*  daily, because if you go back to those Blatch years, that group, and then I [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2007.12s)]
*  followed Blatch years, that was your first book. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2010.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2013.96s)]
*  I didn't get, I mean, I still have to pay the advance back, but they had a [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2014.2s)]
*  thing where they would be on the road and like, I think one guy on the team [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2018.36s)]
*  complained about having to pay a cover charge, going to a club, like they were [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2023.12s)]
*  just constantly sharing with you everything you could assume about like [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2026.7199999999998s)]
*  where their heads were at that season. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2030.52s)]
*  And the Blatch. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2032.0s)]
*  Early internet too, and the early social media internet, which made it more fun. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2032.4399999999998s)]
*  Blatch's profile pic was incredible. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2036.32s)]
*  So I followed him immediately and then every now and then he would just drop [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2038.52s)]
*  these gems and then like they'd had a bad losing streak again and I felt bad for [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2041.04s)]
*  him because he was like just walking around trying to figure it out. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2046.6s)]
*  It was like late at night. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2049.04s)]
*  The other thing, I don't know if this could ever be a category. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2050.64s)]
*  I don't know if it's a segment, but it could be horny, a sky on Twitter because [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2053.0s)]
*  I'll tell you what the for you feed, you know, look, if you see somebody cute, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2057.72s)]
*  you might look on a profile picture. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2061.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2062.6s)]
*  And then next thing you know, you can like, Hey, this guy likes cute girls, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2062.84s)]
*  which I think makes, makes, you know, checks a lot of boxes for a lot of [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2066.04s)]
*  American males out there. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2069.3199999999997s)]
*  So then you'll see like a picture and you'll go, Oh, this guy follows her. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2070.44s)]
*  And then if I'm being honest, I've kept track of it a little bit. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2077.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh, I'll go. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2081.6800000000003s)]
*  There's a few dudes that are not afraid to hit that follow button and it just [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2082.44s)]
*  does circle back to the wizard. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2086.84s)]
*  So I would like to have you keep it. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2088.2400000000002s)]
*  Andre Blatch forever, just because I like talking about him. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2090.6800000000003s)]

*  Booker eligible, never won a title. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2111.16s)]
*  It's got to be John. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2117.88s)]
*  I agree. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2119.96s)]

*  And then, I mean, let's see he's your guy. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2145.28s)]
*  I understand. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2149.36s)]
*  We been through this before, okay? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2149.64s)]
*  We know how it works. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2151.76s)]
*  He's your guy. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2152.6800000000003s)]
*  He's giving you a lot of special moments. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2153.32s)]
*  confused on why Jot would be fined versus other players doing the same salute. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2154.76s)]
*  Like all you have to do is go through the timeline and all the stuff and the [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2159.5400000000004s)]
*  Jalen Rose interview and all the things that he had to go through, which again, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2163.42s)]
*  he brought on himself and it's fine. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2166.36s)]
*  Like I'm not watching him going, Oh, I don't like this guy because of all [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2168.5200000000004s)]
*  this shit in the past, but it's fairly common sense that you end up being [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2171.86s)]
*  punished based on how often you kind of fall out of this category. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2175.9s)]
*  And that's why Jot's fine. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2180.0400000000004s)]
*  Some of the dream on stuff. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2181.04s)]
*  He gets, he gets punished for a different level of scrutiny because of the past [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2182.28s)]
*  behavior, welcome to life, the Lou Brown award out of nowhere team that surprised [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2188.6s)]
*  us the most Detroit, Portland and Houston, I think are the three. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2193.96s)]
*  And I would have to say as great as the Portland Houston out of nowhere [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2197.88s)]
*  seasons where it has to be Detroit. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2201.84s)]
*  That team was all time rock bottom last year and turned into a really fun [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2204.56s)]
*  league past team. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2208.2s)]
*  They're going to be a succeed probably playing the next round one. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2209.4399999999996s)]
*  There's going to be at least one awesome near fight in that, in that thing. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2212.52s)]
*  Kate turned into a real guy. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2215.24s)]
*  And, uh, for me, it's Detroit. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2217.16s)]
*  Who is it for you? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2219.1s)]
*  So Detroit's the only team in a full season to triple their win total. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2220.64s)]
*  So 14 and 68 last year. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2223.3999999999996s)]
*  And I probably said too many times last season going as bad as they are. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2225.18s)]
*  How are they worse than Washington roster wise? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2228.2999999999997s)]
*  Like this team has so many other things that I like about it versus what the [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2231.18s)]
*  wizards had, and they still ended up finishing behind them, uh, which [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2235.46s)]
*  speaks to the money thing, which you may never get a chance to change that [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2239.7s)]
*  award because it's not just going to be on record is about a dude who took a job [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2242.86s)]
*  who apparently had no interest in learning about his own players. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2247.2200000000003s)]
*  Like it isn't a, it's a comical. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2249.8s)]
*  And they're still taking shots at them a year later. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2253.26s)]
*  Anyone associated with that team is still pretty bummed out about how he [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2255.62s)]
*  approached the job last season. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2260.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2262.7400000000002s)]
*  For a variety of ways. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2263.06s)]
*  There's a technical thing historically on tripling your win total because the [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2264.54s)]
*  Bobcats in 2012 finished at seven and 59 and then went 21 and 61 the next year. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2268.2s)]
*  But remember that was a shorter season. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2275.14s)]
*  So they had less games to play, less chances. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2278.14s)]
*  There's not a Bob. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2280.8999999999996s)]
*  Are you going to do a Bobcats documentary or would that be straight to. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2281.8999999999996s)]
*  Is anybody going to do that? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2285.74s)]
*  Have you been probably at one, probably a one parter. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2286.54s)]
*  Seems right. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2290.14s)]
*  Let's, uh, we'll take one more break and then we have some good awards left. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2291.66s)]
*  All right. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2295.18s)]
*  One of our big categories, the ML car trying to trade for a retired Michael [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2295.7799999999997s)]

*  What if Lamello Zion and Joe were in the same three team trade? [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2316.26s)]
*  What if Paul George demanded a trade? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2320.2200000000003s)]
*  And what if Phoenix said, fuck this and just stretch Bradley Beale? [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2323.5400000000004s)]
*  Those are my five nominees for goofiest, but possibly real off season subplot. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2327.86s)]
*  Without knowing the nominees, I had Beale and that you're dealing with somebody [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2336.6600000000003s)]
*  who seems totally happy, just gone. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2341.1000000000004s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2343.1800000000003s)]
*  And that's dangerous. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2343.82s)]
*  Send the checks every two weeks. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2344.9s)]
*  But what is it, do you think there's any scenario where, where he goes, all right, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2349.1000000000004s)]
*  like, I know you don't want me to be here and you guys brought me off the bench for [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2354.5s)]
*  the stretch and this hasn't been a good season. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2358.6600000000003s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2362.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean, what's the market for him on top of everything else? [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2363.5s)]
*  Does that fix their problems? [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2365.34s)]
*  Probably not because he's at this point. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2366.78s)]
*  There's only one thing that's going on. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2369.38s)]
*  I remember Reggie Theis was a good one. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2370.7s)]
*  I can't remember if he was on the Bulls or the Kings, but he just got benched and [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2373.18s)]
*  they just didn't play him and they basically tried to break him. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2376.7s)]
*  The cap situation was way different back then than it is now, but that's Phoenix's [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2379.66s)]
*  last resort is to just not play him anymore. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2384.18s)]
*  And, you know, be like, all right, we'll keep paying you, but you're just [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2386.98s)]
*  not going to play basketball. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2390.18s)]
*  So, uh, I don't know. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2391.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2393.8599999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2394.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2395.02s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2395.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2396.22s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2396.8199999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2397.42s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2398.1s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2398.74s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2399.22s)]
*  Uh, I think it might be a game of chicken. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2400.3s)]
*  He might be okay with it though. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2402.6600000000003s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2403.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2405.26s)]
*  Whatever I watched in that Boston game, I was really startled by. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2406.26s)]
*  I hadn't seen anything remotely approached that in a while. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2409.34s)]
*  Doesn't the social media era, it doesn't really happen. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2411.94s)]
*  By the way, when he also, uh, was out for that stretch, there was this kind of [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2414.6600000000003s)]
*  tease Phoenix moment where they were, I liked the way they were playing again for [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2421.2200000000003s)]
*  like 10 days or something like that. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2425.98s)]
*  And then they got killed and Durant got hurt and the moment was over. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2428.14s)]
*  Um, so Phoenix stretching Bradley Beal, which nobody's been stretched with two [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2433.5s)]
*  years and a hundred million left on their deal, but as a wait again under the second [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2440.46s)]
*  apron and just basically take the head for the next five years, it's not inconceivable. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2445.3399999999997s)]
*  Um, the Zaza Pekuli award for the one rule that absolutely needs to be changed. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2450.2599999999998s)]
*  What did you have for this? [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2456.9s)]
*  All farm drives from the offensive player. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2459.14s)]
*  It's, you know, this isn't my big rant like last year, uh, where I just kind of [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2461.9s)]
*  lost my mind on that podcast, but I think we're all better for it, but this is just [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2467.02s)]
*  there's certain players, kind of the PJ Washington where as they're hitting the [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2471.66s)]
*  hole, like a running back and they have that forearm locked out. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2475.14s)]
*  Davion Mitchell had one the other night where he drove and hit a defender so hard [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2479.46s)]
*  and then got the shot up and there was like a little bit of contact coming back [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2484.1s)]
*  towards him and Davion looked at the rest like, are you guys kidding me? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2487.18s)]
*  He touched me. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2490.1s)]
*  And you're like, dude, you're mad. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2491.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2493.2599999999998s)]
*  You off arm this guy. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2493.46s)]
*  So I think there's a little cleaning up that has to be done on how aggressive the [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2494.98s)]
*  off arm is of the ball handler on drives. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2499.3s)]
*  I like it. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2503.62s)]
*  I have two runner up and then my number one, um, I'll make the annual plea. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2504.58s)]
*  Please don't let coaches challenge block charges anymore. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2509.7s)]
*  Let's just say the call is the call and we just move on. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2513.22s)]
*  I never want to watch another replay of a review of a block charge. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2515.38s)]
*  I don't think I should be able to have to eat the field goal attempt on a half [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2519.82s)]
*  court shot. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2524.38s)]
*  I just get rid of that, make it a team shot the same way they have like team [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2525.62s)]
*  rebounds. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2528.9s)]
*  Um, because then I think it would inspire more people to try to take half [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2529.62s)]
*  quarter three court shots. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2533.38s)]
*  And we might have a couple. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2534.82s)]
*  If you care about your field goal percentage that much that you end up seven [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2536.1s)]
*  to 15 instead of seven to 16, don't ask for the fucking ball on the inbounds. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2540.06s)]
*  How about the guy who doesn't care? [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2545.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2547.1800000000003s)]
*  That's what drives me crazy. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2548.1800000000003s)]
*  He's like, so now you're going to pretend that you didn't get the shot off [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2549.3s)]
*  the time because you didn't want to hurt your field goal percentage. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2551.3s)]
*  Stop getting the ball in the inbounds. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2553.46s)]
*  But the other guys that don't care and understand like as absurd as the shot is [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2555.54s)]
*  that they're not more worried about a couple of percentage points. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2559.26s)]
*  I also think we should have 20 second instant replay challenges where within 20 [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2563.34s)]
*  seconds it's like you think now and we just flip it and keep the game going [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2568.46s)]
*  versus like the five minutes. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2572.82s)]
*  But here's my big one. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2573.98s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2575.62s)]
*  I almost had this last year and I think it's gotten worse this year and I really [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2576.1800000000003s)]
*  hate it and I don't know where, where the end game is, but the rolling the ball [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2579.86s)]
*  and the inbounds pass. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2584.38s)]
*  So the clock starts, but the shot clock doesn't start. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2586.38s)]
*  And this whole game of like the ball's just going to roll and we're going to [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2589.86s)]
*  kill time. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2593.86s)]
*  And then somebody's like, all right, fine. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2594.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm going to run. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2596.1400000000003s)]
*  First of all, somebody's going to get injured on this at some point. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2596.86s)]
*  Somebody's going to dive into somebody else's legs and somebody's going to lose [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2599.1400000000003s)]
*  their knee. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2602.06s)]
*  I just think it's so stupid. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2602.7000000000003s)]
*  You roll the ball and the shot clock should start and the game clock should [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2604.42s)]
*  start. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2607.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't know why they do it this way. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2607.66s)]
*  And I would change this. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2609.62s)]
*  So that's my passion for this year. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2610.98s)]
*  We saw. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2612.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I'm cool with that. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2614.02s)]
*  I don't know that we're ever going to get shorter reviews. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2614.86s)]
*  We might pretend we are, but [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2617.1s)]
*  20 second quickie reviews. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2618.62s)]
*  I left this award open for you, the Ben Simmons award for best Ben Simmons [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2620.98s)]
*  moment figured you'd have something and you could just go. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2624.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2628.5s)]
*  He had a push shot the other night. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2628.74s)]
*  It was a couple of weeks ago where it was pretty ugly coming out, but then it [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2630.54s)]
*  went in and then based on the confidence from that first one going in, he had hit [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2633.98s)]
*  back to back shots within a few minutes of each other, which I think has to be [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2638.5s)]
*  one of the highest output moments we've had in a rotation. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2642.06s)]
*  I thought it was that until last night playing Dallas, Anthony Davis is on the [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2645.3s)]
*  left side. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2650.02s)]
*  He has a primary defender on him. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2650.7400000000002s)]
*  Simmons is the low man and Simmons rotated a double Anthony Davis and then [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2652.7s)]
*  communicated in a way that you don't see where it was almost like, Hey, you see [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2657.58s)]
*  Davis over there. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2662.5s)]
*  This is like, wow. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2663.3s)]
*  The clock is going. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2663.86s)]
*  I'm going to now go over here and double team them. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2664.98s)]
*  So you've got to slide over if somebody cuts behind me and everybody's like, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2666.82s)]
*  great, that's awesome. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2671.1000000000004s)]
*  And then Davis ran it. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2672.0600000000004s)]
*  So I thought it was great communication. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2672.7400000000002s)]
*  Even if it felt a little slower than what I'm used to. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2674.1800000000003s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2677.1000000000004s)]
*  You run positive Ben Simmons moments. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2677.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2679.78s)]
*  I was going to go for the, uh, the preseason media day for the nets. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2681.6200000000003s)]
*  When he said how he's going to be a leader this year for the team. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2687.1800000000003s)]
*  I had that. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2691.1800000000003s)]
*  Buyout watch was fun. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2694.2200000000003s)]
*  Then they bought them out. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2695.6600000000003s)]
*  Um, the 2010 Baron Davis award for single best mail-in. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2697.26s)]
*  This is, I think the toughest category we've had so far because you could make a [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2704.94s)]
*  small case for Paul George on the Sixers most years, but not this year. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2710.1000000000004s)]
*  Jimmy Butler on Miami and Bradley Beal just the whole season. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2714.2200000000003s)]
*  And it is like bird of magic in the mid eighties. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2718.26s)]
*  We could argue about this for days. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2721.1000000000004s)]
*  I personally think it's Butler on Miami because he was willfully trying to [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2723.54s)]
*  force their hand to get traded and doing all kinds of things, but I also can't [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2728.1000000000004s)]
*  shake Beal and I don't want to have co-winners, so I'm going to, I'm going to [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2732.82s)]
*  let you pick. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2736.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2740.46s)]
*  I mean, if you're just going Jimmy, but you know, like any great drama, he's [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2740.7400000000002s)]
*  got that kind of redemptive arc right now is annoying as that may be. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2744.1800000000003s)]
*  And I would expect Miami fans should be annoying. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2747.7400000000002s)]
*  I guess, you know, it's hard to pretend that you're in, but I'll never understand [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2750.94s)]
*  lacing them up, going to play basketball and then going, I don't care if I look [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2756.22s)]
*  bad, I can't imagine having that inside of you where you would go, well, that [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2760.86s)]
*  guy scored on me because I don't care. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2766.54s)]
*  Or I didn't try to help us win because I don't care. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2768.3s)]
*  And I'm just not going to, I'm just not really going to play that hard. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2772.74s)]
*  I've already made my money or whatever. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2776.1s)]
*  Like you'd think some of that stuff, like at least with all the bullshit that [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2777.74s)]
*  Durant has gone through where some of it, I think is unfair. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2782.14s)]
*  Some of it is certainly fair and he's brought it on himself. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2785.18s)]
*  So I'm not absolving a blame here, but you know, it's been a pretty soap opera [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2787.54s)]
*  ish second half of Durant's career. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2792.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2794.4599999999996s)]
*  But there's never been a moment where I've seen him going through all of his [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2795.2599999999998s)]
*  stuff, where I haven't like, I've never questioned how much he wanted to play [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2797.9399999999996s)]
*  basketball. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2801.7799999999997s)]
*  I think once he finally gets out there runs, like he wants to beat you the [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2802.3799999999997s)]
*  entire time. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2806.22s)]
*  And look, there's 450, 500 plus players over the course of the season. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2807.06s)]
*  There's going to be a couple guys that actually don't really love basketball and [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2811.2999999999997s)]
*  don't really care. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2814.7s)]
*  But I can't imagine actually being really good. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2815.62s)]
*  Like Beal's an incredibly talented player. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2818.14s)]
*  We all know how good Jimmy can be. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2819.74s)]
*  It'll forever blow my mind that somebody has that ability. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2821.98s)]
*  And maybe that's just a disconnect of them looking at it as a job. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2826.06s)]
*  And I'm still just in love with the game of going like, I don't care if I look bad [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2828.54s)]
*  in front of all these people that came to see me tonight because I'm getting paid. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2831.7s)]
*  And I don't care. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2835.7s)]
*  So my tiebreaker would be Beal because. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2836.4199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2840.18s)]
*  I think that's the right answer. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2840.3799999999997s)]
*  Cause at least Butler, something really seemingly catastrophic happened with him [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2841.8599999999997s)]
*  and Pat Riley. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2846.7799999999997s)]
*  And there was some sort of breach, whoever was right, whoever was wrong, that [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2847.62s)]
*  made it impossible for Butler to play even at a decent level for them anymore. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2851.7799999999997s)]
*  He was just broken in Miami. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2857.74s)]
*  I don't know what Beal's excuses. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2859.7799999999997s)]
*  And look, the metrics are the worst he's been at since his third year in the league. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2862.18s)]
*  The last time he's played, I think more than 60 games is 2018, 19. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2867.5s)]
*  So even when the trade was made and we understand how talented he is. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2872.4599999999996s)]
*  Cause I remember I had said, like, if you go through this, this guy's missing like [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2875.7s)]
*  20, 25% of the season. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2878.58s)]
*  And there was some pushback cause I was using total games on the shortened [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2881.3799999999997s)]
*  seasons and it's like, okay, but you're still, you're making an excuse for a guy [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2885.3399999999997s)]
*  that doesn't seem like he's available enough. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2889.06s)]
*  He's, he just doesn't on top of everything else. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2892.2599999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2895.14s)]
*  Again, you know, if you're Phoenix with the effort that you get from him on [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2895.9s)]
*  certain nights, you'd almost rather him not be available. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2899.06s)]
*  We got to rip through a couple of words here. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2902.86s)]
*  Um, the shame baddie award for Sloan conference, Statner, darling du jour. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2904.9s)]
*  This just happened. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2910.22s)]
*  That big article on Yocage's defense and him kicking, kicking passes and how he's [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2911.02s)]
*  had the most kick passes in this decade and more kick passes. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2915.7799999999997s)]
*  Um, this whole thing about Yocage, like the, actually his defense, by the way, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2920.8999999999996s)]
*  I've always felt this way. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2926.1s)]
*  I think when you take like the best players, I still feel like. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2926.9799999999996s)]
*  I felt this way about staff. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2930.3799999999997s)]
*  I felt this way about, um, bird and magic once upon a time, even though magic [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2931.58s)]
*  would get torched by small guards, but those guys were always, they're always in [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2936.18s)]
*  steals. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2939.8999999999996s)]
*  They were always like, could read what the other teams was doing. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2940.4199999999996s)]
*  They're always good coming out of timeouts on defense. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2943.1s)]
*  Um, but I like this whole Yocage thing. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2946.62s)]
*  Um, and then the other candidate for this is Yocage is on off stuff is just [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2948.7s)]
*  the most incredible it's ever been. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2953.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean, when he plays, they have like a 125.4 rating or something like that, which [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2955.5s)]
*  should be the best ever. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2960.62s)]
*  And when he doesn't play their 30th in the league on offense, so they're either [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2961.46s)]
*  best all time or worst in the league, depending on whether he plays or not. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2964.98s)]
*  There's so many good advanced stats that I, I swear, I don't, I [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2969.66s)]
*  think there's going to be some late Yocage momentum for MVP next week, even [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2973.06s)]
*  though it seems like she hasn't locked up. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2976.94s)]
*  I think the stats are so crazy and I don't want to spoil next week's pod. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2978.94s)]
*  The stats are so crazy. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2983.7799999999997s)]
*  And the season has been so unbelievable. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2985.46s)]
*  Fandel has she at like minus a thousand or something like that. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2987.7799999999997s)]
*  I don't know if it's over yet. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2990.58s)]
*  That's all I'm going to say. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2992.66s)]
*  Sounds like somebody's leaning Yocage. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2994.38s)]
*  Nobody's leaning anywhere. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2996.58s)]
*  The David Khan award for worst GM performance. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=2998.62s)]
*  So my big question is, is this now become the Nico Harrison award? [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3002.22s)]
*  Did he do enough to supplant David Khan? [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3006.46s)]
*  Who took Johnny Flynn and Ricky Rubio over Steph Curry among 17 other [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3010.22s)]
*  terrible things he did. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3015.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3017.18s)]
*  Nico was good last year. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3019.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3022.02s)]
*  So just one bad, one bad night. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3022.58s)]
*  Pretty bad one. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3025.74s)]
*  This isn't, I can't believe I called her. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3029.58s)]
*  It's like, I can't believe I married a cocktail waitress in Thailand. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3031.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3036.34s)]
*  Well, nominees Nico Harrison, Sacramento firing Mike Brown, and then [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3038.86s)]
*  panic trading De'Aaron Fox, New Orleans throwing Dyson Daniels into the Murray [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3043.1000000000004s)]
*  trade, Miami's entire handling of the Jimmy Butler deal or Denver being 5 [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3048.0200000000004s)]
*  million under the second apron and not having a bench. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3055.46s)]
*  Those would be my, uh, David Connoll word worst front office nominees. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3058.9s)]
*  But the answer is Nico Harrison. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3063.38s)]
*  Uh, but I least think you should bring up Messiah because Messiah is [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3065.46s)]
*  Oh, with all the extensions. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3069.3399999999997s)]
*  Great. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3070.5s)]
*  Let's add them. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3071.2599999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3072.2999999999997s)]
*  So Messiah Sidon scene with Ingram gave him three years, 120 million guaranteed. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3072.62s)]
*  And you could say he hasn't played a game for him yet inside and seen it. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3077.3399999999997s)]
*  Obviously he knows what he's doing. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3080.42s)]
*  You look at the free agent thing that we teased earlier, like maybe there's a [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3081.5s)]
*  number out there for Ingram that's higher than we could imagine, which is [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3085.02s)]
*  usually the lesson that we hear or, uh, I should say experience every time we [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3087.7s)]
*  start going like, Oh, why is that guy going to make that much money? [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3091.8199999999997s)]
*  And then he gets signed to it. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3093.8999999999996s)]
*  But it's Scotty Barnes Ingram quickly, RJ Barrett and Pertle next year [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3094.8199999999997s)]
*  for a combined $156.4 million. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3100.7s)]
*  Seven seed at best. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3106.1s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3110.3799999999997s)]
*  I mean, look, what if they get their players back to play them? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3110.8999999999996s)]
*  Maybe with dark, who knows? [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3114.9399999999996s)]
*  I mean, they've, they've outperformed everything you could possibly imagine the [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3116.38s)]
*  second half of the year, so maybe there's a developing all the guy, maybe there'd [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3119.6600000000003s)]
*  be the deepest team in the league next year. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3123.26s)]
*  It's just an expensive five. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3124.6600000000003s)]
*  I'd love to know for that five. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3126.6200000000003s)]
*  I'd love to know why Denver didn't do a little bit more this year. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3128.6600000000003s)]
*  I don't understand how their bench is this bad. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3133.78s)]
*  When you are being blessed with the best offensive player since God knows when. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3137.46s)]
*  No, not top 20, but pretty good. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3145.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3146.7400000000002s)]
*  Not top 20, but close. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3148.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3149.54s)]
*  I just, I just want to shout them out. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3150.42s)]
*  You have this amazing asset you have to spend when you have an asset like that. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3152.54s)]
*  And they're not doing it and they own other teams. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3156.18s)]
*  It's not like they don't have the money. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3158.18s)]
*  It's very strange to me. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3159.1s)]
*  You know what though is this might be the, I drafted these guys. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3159.98s)]
*  I brought in Pickett. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3163.7400000000002s)]
*  I brought in Watson, you know, I brought in Swather, you know, just trust me. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3164.7400000000002s)]
*  I know what I'm doing. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3171.94s)]
*  Well, I don't think you do. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3172.86s)]
*  Cause I think that a lot of people would want to play Denver in the [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3174.14s)]
*  playoffs, the way this is shaken up. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3176.5s)]
*  Denver and Memphis are the two teams. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3177.9s)]
*  I think people are fine playing as great as Yokoches. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3179.58s)]
*  It'll be funny if they get bounced out. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3184.42s)]
*  The, I'm just advanced scouting Yokoche. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3187.98s)]
*  There was a fly in front of me for those watching on the clip. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3191.98s)]
*  I'm advanced scouting it. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3195.58s)]
*  Cause if he loses in the first round, then it's going to be like, can we get [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3196.58s)]
*  Marcus Morris back in here? [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3199.9s)]
*  He's outside the building. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3201.14s)]
*  I would say them and Memphis are the two best candidates for the four [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3203.22s)]
*  oh sweep in round one. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3206.74s)]
*  If we were going to have a shocking, I can't believe that team got swept. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3209.02s)]
*  I would have Denver and Memphis. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3213.06s)]
*  The Vitali Patapiko award for worst deadline trade named after the time [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3214.7s)]
*  Rick Patino during a strike season gave up an unprotected first round pick [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3218.66s)]
*  for Vitali Patapiko that turned out that could have either taken Sean [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3222.46s)]
*  Marion or Andre Miller and they didn't get either of those two. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3226.1s)]
*  So I don't love Miami dumping Dennis Schroeder for no reason when they got [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3228.7s)]
*  him in that deal, when they clearly kind of want to be a playoff team, I guess. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3232.66s)]
*  But at the Mark Williams trade, when you have Luca and you have this [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3236.62s)]
*  chance in the West for the Lakers to do that trade and then to back out of it [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3240.8199999999997s)]
*  and then just kind of get nothing. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3246.8599999999997s)]
*  And now it's unquestionably going to haunt them in the playoffs that [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3248.22s)]
*  they don't have a center. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3251.02s)]
*  I have to nominate them. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3252.1s)]
*  I have to nominate them. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3253.22s)]
*  I have to nominate them. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3253.98s)]
*  I have to nominate them. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3254.7799999999997s)]
*  I have to nominate them. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3255.7s)]
*  I have to nominate them. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3256.46s)]
*  And one of the things I love about Miami's center, um, I have to nominate that. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3257.3s)]
*  We're deadline is the trade is the Mark Williams cancellation trade. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3260.86s)]
*  That's what I have. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3266.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't know what's going to happen with LA here. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3270.5s)]
*  I don't know what's going to happen in the West. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3272.5400000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3273.9s)]
*  Other than, I think, okay, he's going to beat all of these teams. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3273.98s)]
*  And I'd be really, really surprised if they're not representing the West. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3276.4s)]
*  I think they're that good. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3279.42s)]
*  Me as well. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3280.6800000000003s)]
*  And they have all of these options and it's hard to find like a flaw with them. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3281.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean, I guess we saw one Friday night. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3285.1000000000004s)]
*  The double big lineup, they had some issues. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3287.26s)]
*  They kinda got pounded on the boards in a way [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3290.1000000000004s)]
*  that I was like, oh, okay. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3292.0200000000004s)]
*  A little slight fly in the ointment, all right. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3294.7000000000003s)]
*  The credit to EMA too for the double big patience. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3298.26s)]
*  Because they're alone with Adams. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3302.0600000000004s)]
*  Adams was good in that game. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3303.26s)]
*  You watch that game? [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3304.1000000000004s)]
*  Adams was like, they were like impactful in that game. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3304.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3307.5400000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know, that wasn't nothing. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3308.7400000000002s)]
*  But no, I came back in after a tough day on the seas [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3310.9s)]
*  and then watched it late. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3314.3s)]
*  And sometimes you're better watching it [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3316.3399999999997s)]
*  when you know what happened. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3318.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3319.46s)]
*  Because now you're not watching it with anticipation. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3320.2999999999997s)]
*  You're just watching, trying to figure out [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3321.46s)]
*  what was going on. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3322.74s)]
*  And I think there'll be, sometimes, [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3324.02s)]
*  this is being really, really critical [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3327.74s)]
*  of an awesome team historically here. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3329.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3331.58s)]
*  But there'll be some like, Kacen Wallace minutes [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3332.42s)]
*  where you go, well, is that? [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3334.74s)]
*  And then I'm like, what are you mad about all eight guys [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3336.2599999999998s)]
*  not being off the charts, impossible to deal with [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3339.02s)]
*  on both ends of the floor? [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3341.38s)]
*  Because I think last year, as we were ramping up [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3343.06s)]
*  for the playoffs, like right around this time last year, [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3345.3799999999997s)]
*  we were talking Celtics and you just laid it all out. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3348.02s)]
*  Like whatever your issues are, and I think we both had them [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3350.8599999999997s)]
*  with some of the late offensive stuff, [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3353.2999999999997s)]
*  there's still games with the Celtics offense. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3354.9399999999996s)]
*  I'm like, is this still really good? [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3356.8199999999997s)]
*  And then it's like last 15, second offense. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3358.14s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, it is, it is that good. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3360.8199999999997s)]
*  At some point, math becomes math. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3362.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3364.4599999999996s)]
*  OKC's math is outrageous. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3365.2999999999997s)]
*  I'd like Drew Holliday to have the ball in his hands [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3368.02s)]
*  more often on some of these threes, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3369.98s)]
*  but that's just what they're gonna do. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3372.3399999999997s)]
*  Even if there's a night where I don't really love it, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3375.54s)]
*  and then you go check the numbers again, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3377.7000000000003s)]
*  and you're like, hey, you just, you have to love it. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3378.86s)]
*  Move on, accept it. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3380.82s)]
*  You laid out the stat profile historically, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3381.94s)]
*  point differential, all this stuff. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3383.9s)]
*  What OKC is doing right now puts them, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3385.1s)]
*  at least on a regular season list [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3387.62s)]
*  of one of the all-time special teams. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3389.34s)]
*  Are you the same place with them now [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3391.1800000000003s)]
*  that you were with Boston last year, [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3392.94s)]
*  where it was a bit of a wake-up of like, [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3394.5s)]
*  hey, whatever you think of this team, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3396.7000000000003s)]
*  they're awesome and headed to the playoffs [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3398.7400000000002s)]
*  and should be the clear favorite, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3401.14s)]
*  and we should stop questioning it [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3402.6600000000003s)]
*  just because it feels new with them. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3404.26s)]
*  Even if they were the finals. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3406.0200000000004s)]
*  I think they're the clear favorite in the West. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3406.86s)]
*  The only difference with them in Boston [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3408.5800000000004s)]
*  is Boston at least had had a bunch of guys [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3410.78s)]
*  who had been in a bunch of big games and big situations, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3413.1800000000003s)]
*  and OKC has- [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3416.5800000000004s)]
*  I shouldn't even say it's new, you're right. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3417.42s)]
*  No, but that's the only thing you're gonna nitpick on [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3418.82s)]
*  if you're gonna nitpick OKC is, [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3422.42s)]
*  it's like, well, we just have to kinda see it. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3423.9s)]
*  They gotta win four straight rounds, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3426.26s)]
*  they're gonna be playing some of the best players [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3427.5s)]
*  in the league and some of the best players of all time, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3429.1400000000003s)]
*  and let's see. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3431.26s)]
*  But the math is saying it would be a complete aberration [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3432.34s)]
*  if they didn't make the finals. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3435.78s)]
*  Like something really, really truly fluke-y [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3437.38s)]
*  would have happened. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3439.38s)]
*  And then when they play Boston, [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3440.58s)]
*  we've seen those games and they had really [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3442.9s)]
*  the two fourth quarters where they really stuck it [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3446.38s)]
*  to Boston, so yeah, if you're betting your life, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3449.5s)]
*  OKC's the pick, I don't think there's any question. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3451.94s)]
*  But who knows? [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3454.7000000000003s)]
*  I did that Houston game gave me a little hope, [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3456.26s)]
*  we're like, oh, I wonder if we'll see this in the playoffs. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3459.2200000000003s)]
*  I wonder if teams are gonna try to bang them around. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3461.34s)]
*  Let's do the Team Moran Award [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3466.7000000000003s)]
*  for best most polarizing NBA family member, [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3469.78s)]
*  which I think was obviously Brawny this year [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3474.1800000000003s)]
*  just because of all the content he generated. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3476.02s)]
*  We don't need to cover all the other family members. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3480.1800000000003s)]
*  This one I'm really excited about [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3482.54s)]
*  because this is really where you shine. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3484.1800000000003s)]
*  And I'm interested to see how many guys [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3486.86s)]
*  we have in the same list. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3488.1400000000003s)]
*  Reggie Lewis, I don't know, I just like this guy award [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3489.1s)]
*  for young guy who doesn't play much. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3492.14s)]
*  But you just kind of like, last year, [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3494.7s)]
*  Kamara was on our list for this. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3496.2999999999997s)]
*  I have the following nominees, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3499.14s)]
*  and feel free to throw in anybody else. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3500.9s)]
*  The two Nets guys, Keon Johnson, Jalen Wilson. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3502.74s)]
*  Those guys just fucking play hard every game. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3505.58s)]
*  Every time I watch the Nets, I'm like, Jesus Christ. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3507.58s)]
*  These guys really give a shit. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3510.14s)]
*  Bryce Sensible on Utah. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3512.38s)]
*  I don't know how much Utah you've watched, [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3515.22s)]
*  but the catch and shoot numbers are crazy. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3516.46s)]
*  He's clearly gonna be a nine man rotation guy [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3519.78s)]
*  for a good team at some point in his career. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3523.06s)]
*  We've talked about Ron Holland before. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3525.26s)]
*  I still like Walker on the Pacers. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3527.46s)]
*  I don't know why, and I can't explain it. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3529.18s)]
*  Guy Santos on the Warriors. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3532.26s)]
*  The plus minus is crazy for him, [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3536.38s)]
*  and he also seems very comfortable playing [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3537.9s)]
*  with Hall of Fame players. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3539.78s)]
*  And then I'll throw in AJ Johnson, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3541.94s)]
*  just because Zach mentioned him on the pod last week [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3544.18s)]
*  about how he's looked a little frisky on the Wizards. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3546.7s)]
*  Who do you have? [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3549.4199999999996s)]
*  Anybody else I didn't mention? [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3550.2599999999998s)]
*  There's a few frisky Wizards, by the way. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3551.46s)]
*  Including Bub Carrington, who was my first choice for this. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3555.3799999999997s)]
*  Had 32 the other night. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3559.2599999999998s)]
*  He is 20 in July, and he's getting shots up now, man. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3561.3799999999997s)]
*  He's getting those shots up. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3567.8599999999997s)]
*  He's 20 in July? [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3569.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3571.2599999999998s)]
*  Oh my Lord. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3572.1s)]
*  He's 6'4". [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3573.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3574.18s)]
*  I sent a text to somebody with the Wizards. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3575.46s)]
*  Remember when they had that fun Knicks game months ago? [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3578.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3581.82s)]
*  I sent a text and said, [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3582.66s)]
*  hey, I know you're not on everybody's radar, [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3584.1s)]
*  but I happened to catch three games [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3587.14s)]
*  in a 10-day span or whatever. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3588.78s)]
*  I was like, you guys are playing really hard. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3590.78s)]
*  And it was just a, thanks for watching. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3592.22s)]
*  I don't know if I shared that with you. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3596.5s)]
*  Sometimes I'm repeating myself here a bit. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3597.82s)]
*  I don't think you shared that one with me. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3599.78s)]
*  Maybe I shared it off the air, [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3601.22s)]
*  but I think- [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3603.86s)]
*  So you got Bubb? [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3604.7000000000003s)]
*  Bubb's your number one? [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3605.54s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm gonna give a little love. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3606.38s)]
*  His rotational stuff could be out of the mix here now. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3608.02s)]
*  As Minnesota probably feels better about what they're doing. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3610.6600000000003s)]
*  But Jaylen Clark having a moment with this team [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3612.9s)]
*  where it's like, hey, Dillingham's gonna get [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3615.06s)]
*  the first minutes, and I think it's a little too chaotic [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3616.34s)]
*  for him that they're not gonna trust him [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3618.78s)]
*  in some tight spots here. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3620.34s)]
*  Terrence Shannon not getting minutes [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3621.98s)]
*  when it felt like he was probably one [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3623.54s)]
*  of the more plug and play rotational guys [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3624.86s)]
*  that could come in and get you some buckets [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3626.82s)]
*  because of what he had done in college, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3628.7000000000003s)]
*  and he's older, and all that kind of stuff. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3630.02s)]
*  But there have been some defensive things [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3631.74s)]
*  with Jaylen Clark with Minnesota [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3634.1s)]
*  where I'm like, all right, this dude is ready. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3636.14s)]
*  He's not remotely intimidated by any of this stuff. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3642.8999999999996s)]
*  So I don't know what he projects to be. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3645.14s)]
*  The three point shooting numbers, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3647.14s)]
*  it's not like it's a high volume, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3648.8999999999996s)]
*  but they're pretty good, and he just competes like crazy. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3649.8599999999997s)]
*  And he kinda almost jumped the other guys [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3653.3399999999997s)]
*  that he would have more expectations for [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3655.3399999999997s)]
*  at certain times this season. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3657.9799999999996s)]
*  I almost threw Shireman on this. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3660.42s)]
*  Not enough of a sample size, [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3663.7400000000002s)]
*  but there's been a couple moments where you're like, [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3665.42s)]
*  oh, it's not nothing here. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3668.26s)]
*  Carol Dawson award for most underbash and tank job. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3673.02s)]
*  Philly's three and 22 in their last 25, [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3675.54s)]
*  and actively trying not to win games. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3677.98s)]
*  So I think they're the winner. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3680.02s)]
*  Shout out to Utah. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3681.7000000000003s)]
*  But they did it. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3683.62s)]
*  Look, we can't even make fun of Philly [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3684.7000000000003s)]
*  because you're sitting there and you're looking [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3686.38s)]
*  at the OKC pick, and when this conversation [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3687.9399999999996s)]
*  started ramping up, it's like they have the seventh [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3690.4199999999996s)]
*  or eighth worst record in the NBA. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3691.8999999999996s)]
*  And this is the part where I, again, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3694.02s)]
*  there's certain things with Darrell that I totally respect. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3696.18s)]
*  It's like, well, if we're doing it, we're doing it. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3698.06s)]
*  We're not screwing around, we're shutting down. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3699.4599999999996s)]
*  Nobody's here. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3700.9799999999996s)]
*  And they were 19 and 27 at that point, [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3702.2599999999998s)]
*  and have now on this four and 28 stretch. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3704.7s)]
*  I mean, Quentin Grimes cost them a couple games in there. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3707.1s)]
*  This could have been like a two and 30 stretch. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3709.8599999999997s)]
*  This could have been a layup, yeah. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3712.14s)]
*  Dwight Howard, sorry dude, I can't help it. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3713.7799999999997s)]
*  I just don't like watching him play basketball award. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3715.46s)]
*  Julio Serrano seems like a nice guy. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3720.66s)]
*  I just don't really enjoy watching him play basketball. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3722.18s)]
*  He's my pick. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3724.34s)]
*  And he's been playing better lately [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3726.5s)]
*  than he's played on Minnesota all year, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3727.82s)]
*  but I just don't really enjoy it. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3730.7400000000002s)]
*  And I'll be honest, 15, 16, 17 years of DeMar DeRozan [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3733.82s)]
*  at this point, I think I'm good. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3739.42s)]
*  Oh, you don't, see, I actually find myself coming back. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3741.94s)]
*  I think I'm good. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3743.9s)]
*  I just feel like I'm okay with it. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3744.74s)]
*  I'm okay with the experience. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3746.3799999999997s)]
*  And Kyle Kuzma is another one that I think I'm good. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3748.02s)]
*  Just think I'm fine. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3755.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm fine there. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3756.3399999999997s)]
*  Who do you have for this award? [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3758.66s)]
*  Just wonder what it was like when Sacramento's like, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3762.58s)]
*  hey DeRozan, I can't believe you even offered up DeRozan, [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3764.4599999999996s)]
*  because I think his closing fourth quarter, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3767.4199999999996s)]
*  like getting to his stuff, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3769.06s)]
*  when he got Mowgli twice in that game, [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3770.18s)]
*  when they beat him, [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3772.1s)]
*  when the Cavs had that weird road trip. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3772.9399999999996s)]
*  I'm just, great. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3775.42s)]
*  The team's gonna go 40-42 again. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3776.66s)]
*  Yeah, but there was like, [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3779.2599999999998s)]
*  the Dwight Howard stuff is so funny because. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3780.1s)]
*  Dwight Howard was really good. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3782.58s)]
*  Yeah, he was really good, [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3784.2999999999997s)]
*  but then it was like, hey, [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3785.14s)]
*  I need to be taking all the shots at the end of the games. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3785.98s)]
*  It's like, well, what did you work on this summer? [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3787.98s)]
*  Yeah, if I get fouled, I'm gonna make one or two. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3790.06s)]
*  You have Randall? [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3793.7799999999997s)]
*  Zach Levine. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3794.62s)]
*  I just wanna know what it was like for DeRozan [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3795.46s)]
*  when they were like, hey, guess what? [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3797.02s)]
*  We got Zach Levine again. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3799.02s)]
*  You played with him, right? [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3801.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you guys have chemistry. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3802.5s)]
*  I played with him. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3804.94s)]
*  The Real. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3807.18s)]
*  Thanks for the 30 points, dude. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3808.02s)]
*  It's tough. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3811.2999999999997s)]
*  Levine had the roller coaster ride. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3812.14s)]
*  It was like a stock this year [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3815.2999999999997s)]
*  because I thought he was good on the Bulls [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3816.74s)]
*  and then he left and the Bulls were way more fun [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3818.34s)]
*  to watch right away, [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3820.2999999999997s)]
*  which probably wasn't good for him either. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3821.14s)]
*  Look, I'm telling you, [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3824.18s)]
*  I could do 30 minutes on this, [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3825.54s)]
*  but there are guys that aren't my favorite [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3826.8199999999997s)]
*  and I come to that conclusion after a lot of watching [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3830.7s)]
*  and noticing things. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3833.98s)]
*  And I don't think that it's a coincidence [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3835.26s)]
*  to some of the dudes that I haven't been a huge fan of. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3839.1s)]
*  The guys that I'm talking about that are talented [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3841.22s)]
*  that usually can score and put up some big, big numbers. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3843.1s)]
*  But you look at all the Lakers stuff this year [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3846.66s)]
*  and you go, what's different? [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3850.62s)]
*  Like, hey, Deezer Russell isn't out there [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3853.5s)]
*  for 30 plus minutes a night. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3855.66s)]
*  And the second Levine's out of there, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3857.58s)]
*  even with his ability and the scoring numbers [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3859.3s)]
*  and all this stuff, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3862.1s)]
*  you're like, what's different about Chicago? [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3863.86s)]
*  You're like, well, you know, even with his numbers, [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3867.06s)]
*  like you're removing all the other little things [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3869.66s)]
*  that are just, he never seemed to click for him. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3871.62s)]
*  And so those are the players that I just won't argue about. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3874.38s)]
*  Sometimes you're one trade away, [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3880.2599999999998s)]
*  sometimes you're one injury away. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3881.7799999999997s)]
*  Ray Allen 2010 Playoffs trick or treat award [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3883.8199999999997s)]
*  goes to a team or a player. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3886.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm going to Houston Rockets for this [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3889.74s)]
*  because I've changed my mind on them 17 times [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3891.42s)]
*  during the season. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3893.66s)]
*  And I'll probably change it a couple more times as we go. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3895.1s)]
*  But I went from thinking, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3897.98s)]
*  this is the team you want to play in the playoffs to, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3899.02s)]
*  I don't know, they kind of freaked me out [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3902.86s)]
*  in that OKC game. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3903.94s)]
*  And in general, like they've held this two spot [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3905.9s)]
*  and I kept waiting for them to follow the pack [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3908.26s)]
*  and they had that little losing streak. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3910.06s)]
*  It's never perfect. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3912.42s)]
*  I don't love their offense in the last six, seven, [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3913.54s)]
*  eight minutes, but they play hard and they're really tough. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3915.7000000000003s)]
*  And there's certain matchups where they just overpower. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3920.6200000000003s)]
*  I mean, they out rebounded OKC by 15 rebounds the other night. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3922.6600000000003s)]
*  Granted the game meant nothing to OKC, [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3925.6600000000003s)]
*  but I don't know what to make of them in the playoffs. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3927.78s)]
*  This might be it. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3932.7000000000003s)]
*  There might be no gear at all. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3933.6200000000003s)]
*  It might just be bad shots down the stretch [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3934.98s)]
*  and they lose the series four one [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3936.98s)]
*  where they led into all five. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3938.34s)]
*  Or maybe there's something more there. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3941.02s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3942.38s)]
*  I don't know what to make of them. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3943.2200000000003s)]
*  Clippers for me, because- [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3945.6600000000003s)]
*  Good one. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3947.78s)]
*  Wy looked great again last night, [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3948.66s)]
*  getting his stuff, going left, pull up, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3950.2599999999998s)]
*  can't do anything with it. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3952.38s)]
*  Off the break, kind of transition three, [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3954.2999999999997s)]
*  where you just can see that he's totally locked in [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3957.66s)]
*  to what he wants to be. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3961.3399999999997s)]
*  Zou has been a beast. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3962.38s)]
*  If you get Zou against the wrong team, [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3963.94s)]
*  meaning the wrong team for the other side, [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3966.02s)]
*  because there's just a few teams here [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3967.62s)]
*  that want to play small. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3968.98s)]
*  Like I don't know if, [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3970.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't think the Lakers want to play [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3972.22s)]
*  Jackson Hayes a ton of minutes. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3973.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't think that's breaking news. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3974.38s)]
*  So they'd rather go small, [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3976.02s)]
*  but when they're playing against Golden State [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3977.14s)]
*  and I don't know that I'm right about this, [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3979.38s)]
*  but you're like, are you playing [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3980.22s)]
*  into their hands a little bit by playing small [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3981.06s)]
*  and then them being like, we're fine. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3985.42s)]
*  The answer is yes. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3987.26s)]
*  They're like, please, we can play Dreymon at the five. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3988.42s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3991.42s)]
*  Yeah, so now we get to play small. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3992.34s)]
*  So then when I think about Houston having [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3994.5s)]
*  the double big thing, which changes a lot [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3997.18s)]
*  of how you think about their closing group, [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=3999.22s)]
*  depending on the big guys they're going up against. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4001.06s)]
*  Like the Clippers with the way Zou is playing, [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4003.5s)]
*  and I know that it's a coin toss for Harden [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4007.1s)]
*  and all the playoff stuff. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4010.06s)]
*  Although I think I kind of joked with you, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4011.22s)]
*  like you think he'd be due just to kind of have [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4013.42s)]
*  like a nice little like run, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4015.2599999999998s)]
*  but I feel like his pace does not adjust [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4017.54s)]
*  to the pace that you need it to be. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4019.46s)]
*  And that's why he has the problems that he's had. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4020.2999999999997s)]
*  But there's a scenario where like, [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4023.22s)]
*  there's a first round matchup for them. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4025.86s)]
*  And I'm going, oh my God, like, is there a path here? [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4027.2599999999998s)]
*  Is there a path to- [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4029.46s)]
*  What if they played OKC in round one? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4030.42s)]
*  Imagine. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4034.1s)]
*  I've seen them play twice in person. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4035.8199999999997s)]
*  I was like, shit, this would be an awesome playoff series. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4037.5s)]
*  And they have a couple things they bring to the table [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4039.94s)]
*  that aren't great for OKC. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4042.7799999999997s)]
*  Now there's some things OKC brings to the table [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4045.2599999999998s)]
*  that are horrible for the Clippers, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4047.2599999999998s)]
*  but my point is that's not a typical one eight matchup. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4048.62s)]
*  That's not the Cleveland Cavaliers playing Orlando [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4051.66s)]
*  with no Jalen Suggs in round one. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4055.06s)]
*  Like that's a hard series you're gonna have to win. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4056.58s)]
*  Do you think there's something? [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4059.66s)]
*  Like it wouldn't be a national media thing [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4061.2599999999998s)]
*  because nobody would really care, [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4063.06s)]
*  but considering how all in they went on the Kawhi stuff [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4064.14s)]
*  and how he hasn't been healthy at the end of the playoffs, [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4067.18s)]
*  certainly the end of the year [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4069.58s)]
*  for a bunch of seasons in a row, [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4070.58s)]
*  the Paul George part of it, and then what you've given up, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4072.5s)]
*  and then watching SGA become- [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4074.8199999999997s)]
*  I mean, there's just a lot of shit here where you go, man. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4076.2599999999998s)]
*  Imagine. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4079.3799999999997s)]
*  Imagine if they had some moment of like a 2-2 series [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4080.62s)]
*  in the Western Conference Finals where you go, [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4086.14s)]
*  you know, those guys, Lawrence Frank and the crew, [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4088.06s)]
*  like the strategy was the right strategy [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4090.14s)]
*  and it couldn't have gone, [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4093.2599999999998s)]
*  but yet is there this redemptive arc [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4094.58s)]
*  where they repaired it on the fly [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4096.58s)]
*  and let Paul George just walk [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4098.58s)]
*  because they knew better than anybody else, [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4101.34s)]
*  although they still did offer the three years. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4102.7s)]
*  Is there some part of this where [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4104.5s)]
*  we're being brought into game five [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4107.38s)]
*  and somebody's written a Wright-Thompson essay? [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4109.82s)]
*  Oh, on the Torture Clippers? [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4112.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4115.58s)]
*  Well, if you go to the last 25 games, [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4116.42s)]
*  which is a huge sample size, [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4119.139999999999s)]
*  they're fifth in net rating. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4121.7s)]
*  And when Kawhi plays and looks like the way he's looked, [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4124.38s)]
*  really for a few weeks now, [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4127.66s)]
*  I just wouldn't want to see that team. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4131.0599999999995s)]
*  And honestly, I wouldn't want to see Minnesota either [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4133.18s)]
*  if I'm okay to see. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4135.0599999999995s)]
*  We both think they're gonna make the finals, [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4136.98s)]
*  but it just sucks that those are two possible [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4139.18s)]
*  one-eight matchups. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4142.0599999999995s)]
*  Like you play, you're gonna win 68, 69 games, [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4143.099999999999s)]
*  and that's your prize. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4145.7s)]
*  We only have a couple of words left [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4149.18s)]
*  we can rip through this. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4150.74s)]
*  The White Chocolate was a problem award [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4153.78s)]
*  for 2025 guy whose season was much better [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4156.42s)]
*  in 40 second Twitter highlights. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4159.0599999999995s)]
*  I'll give you Ja, Zion, LaMelo, Jordan Poole, [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4161.34s)]
*  or Russell Westbrook. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4163.86s)]
*  Who do you have? [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4165.42s)]
*  The turn by Nuggets fans on Westbrook here is amazing. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4168.62s)]
*  It feel like that game, [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4173.62s)]
*  I mean, that's another team that might fall to seven, eight. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4176.3s)]
*  That game was a catastrophic loss. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4179.02s)]
*  Like to waste that level of where Jokic got to that game, [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4182.18s)]
*  and to have it 19 times and then blow it, [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4187.1s)]
*  and they haven't won since. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4189.3s)]
*  Look, he's fine as your ninth guy, [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4192.14s)]
*  and as your guy, we're resting all the starters. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4195.18s)]
*  Russ, can you just go out there and do everything [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4197.3s)]
*  and put up a 32, 10, 10, and let us hang around? [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4199.14s)]
*  But I just don't know how you play him in crunch time [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4201.540000000001s)]
*  in some of these games. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4204.46s)]
*  It's too much of a wild card. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4206.740000000001s)]
*  It's too risky, right? [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4209.02s)]
*  The risk exceeds the reward. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4212.14s)]
*  Can't do it. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4214.38s)]
*  You've Jokic, and Murray, and Gordon, and Porter, [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4215.22s)]
*  and Braun, like that's it. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4217.82s)]
*  Russ should never play in crunch time [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4219.34s)]
*  for them in a playoff game. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4221.74s)]
*  This is what I've thought the entire time, [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4224.66s)]
*  because Westbrook has been more accepting of this role [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4226.42s)]
*  with them than at any other point. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4230.42s)]
*  But there may have been, even for somebody as stubborn [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4232.02s)]
*  as he is with his approach to basketball, [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4235.26s)]
*  maybe even he had a realization of going, [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4237.7s)]
*  I need to change this a little bit. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4240.7s)]
*  And when you're playing in the same minutes, [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4242.9s)]
*  the same lineup as Jokic, you can see him almost [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4244.54s)]
*  in a hurry to get him the ball back [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4247.9s)]
*  that could lead to some of those other problems. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4249.66s)]
*  But on the year, considering how bad they needed somebody [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4251.14s)]
*  to play these kind of minutes, [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4254.1s)]
*  a guy that was never really gonna question his own value, [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4255.58s)]
*  the ego of a player that you kind of need [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4260.06s)]
*  as a foundation to even play in this league, [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4262.66s)]
*  it's been a win because of how limited their options were. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4266.26s)]
*  It's like, okay, well, we're gonna get this guy cheap [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4269.62s)]
*  because he's been on six teams here [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4271.1s)]
*  in a very short amount of time, [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4272.62s)]
*  because he hasn't fitted, [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4274.34s)]
*  and maybe he hasn't accepted what he needed to be. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4275.26s)]
*  So I think there was an acceptance part [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4277.34s)]
*  from Westbrook here that was admirable. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4278.74s)]
*  But I think anybody that knew where his limitations were, [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4280.86s)]
*  he were like, is he actually going to close? [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4286.22s)]
*  And I'm with you. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4289.66s)]
*  And it's not just the mistakes in that Minnesota game. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4290.62s)]
*  There's just a lot of times where you're like, [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4292.98s)]
*  what's the spacing going to look like? [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4296.379999999999s)]
*  Is that gonna screw up some of the other stuff [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4298.299999999999s)]
*  they're gonna do? [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4299.86s)]
*  I also think there's something with Westbrook too, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4301.379999999999s)]
*  depending on the matchup, [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4302.9s)]
*  like it's gonna be, if I get to play the Lakers, [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4304.419999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna prove to them that they're morons. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4307.0599999999995s)]
*  If I get to play against the Clippers, [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4309.099999999999s)]
*  there's a revenge factor with like four of these teams. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4311.259999999999s)]
*  How many minutes do you think he's played this year? [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4315.179999999999s)]
*  Are you asking me total minutes? [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4320.0599999999995s)]
*  Total minutes. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4321.26s)]
*  Total minutes, how many do you think he played? [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4322.34s)]
*  I don't know off the top of my head. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4325.38s)]
*  I mean, he's played- [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4327.1s)]
*  Who would your guess be? [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4328.22s)]
*  I'll just tell you. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4331.3s)]
*  2002 minutes heading into tonight's game. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4332.860000000001s)]
*  He's played 2000 minutes. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4336.22s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4338.38s)]
*  They paid nothing for him. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4339.22s)]
*  So for that, it's a win. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4340.7s)]
*  The losses when he's actually involved in the plot, [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4342.5s)]
*  when they're desperately trying to not fall [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4345.780000000001s)]
*  into that six, seven, eight range, [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4347.780000000001s)]
*  and they had a pretty good foothold for the three spot, [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4350.14s)]
*  and now it's looking pretty grim. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4352.38s)]
*  No, he's been really important throughout this season [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4354.22s)]
*  because of their lack of options. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4357.1s)]
*  And so it has worked out, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4358.820000000001s)]
*  but the hesitation I always had with it was, [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4360.900000000001s)]
*  let's see what happens here in the playoffs. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4366.26s)]
*  Because I think this could be the kind of thing [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4368.14s)]
*  where the game log, now who knows, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4369.740000000001s)]
*  maybe it could be game and score and foul of trouble, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4371.14s)]
*  all that kind of stuff. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4373.26s)]
*  But like if we're talking real close games [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4374.1s)]
*  in the first round for Denver- [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4376.06s)]
*  Yeah, he's not out there in the last eight minutes. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4377.3s)]
*  You look at some of those game logs and it's like, [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4379.34s)]
*  okay, 19 minutes, 15 minutes, [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4380.860000000001s)]
*  and then you're like, uh-oh. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4382.62s)]
*  Like now. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4384.06s)]
*  So who's your white chocolate was a problem guy? [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4384.900000000001s)]
*  I would say if you took Isaiah Stewart clips from today [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4387.78s)]
*  and then ran him and said that this was the 90s were like, [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4391.900000000001s)]
*  then everybody would just say, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4395.22s)]
*  oh, Steph would have just had 12 years. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4396.42s)]
*  Oh, he would have been killed. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4398.22s)]
*  That's good, I like that. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4399.42s)]
*  My least favorite con. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4400.58s)]
*  The Stewart pulling down Giannis from behind play [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4401.820000000001s)]
*  is indefensible. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4404.9800000000005s)]
*  That's fucking nasty, man. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4406.58s)]
*  Especially the top five guy in the league. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4408.78s)]
*  All right, three words left. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4410.7s)]
*  The Travolta in Pulp Fiction come back of the year. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4411.66s)]
*  Jimmy Butler, the Lakers as a franchise [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4415.139999999999s)]
*  or Scoot Henderson, who do you have? [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4418.219999999999s)]
*  Scoot. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4420.94s)]
*  Okay, me too. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4421.9s)]
*  Well, this is it. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4423.58s)]
*  The second most prestigious award we have, [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4424.78s)]
*  it's the 2025 Shamit Face Award. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4427.82s)]
*  This is your award. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4431.46s)]
*  I know you put a lot of time and thought and effort [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4432.7s)]
*  into this, so who do you have? [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4435.7s)]
*  Conca Nipple. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4438.1s)]
*  On Duke? [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4441.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4442.38s)]
*  Oh, so you're going prospects. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4443.22s)]
*  Yeah, I've already graded it out. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4444.900000000001s)]
*  What do you like about it? [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4448.26s)]
*  I don't know what age that the red cheeks thing goes away. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4451.5s)]
*  He's awesome, by the way. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4455.34s)]
*  I think he's even better than maybe we realize. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4456.46s)]
*  Maybe get him the ball a few more times last night. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4459.780000000001s)]
*  But you get older, everybody looks younger. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4462.38s)]
*  There's a weird thing that happens. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4466.22s)]
*  I don't know what it is with the science of it, [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4467.34s)]
*  but if you look at fraternity composites, [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4468.860000000001s)]
*  when you're in college, all of the guys [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4471.900000000001s)]
*  from the old pictures look like, [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4473.9400000000005s)]
*  how come that guy was 40 and he was in college? [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4476.9800000000005s)]
*  That's just dudes looked older. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4480.14s)]
*  And then when you're older [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4482.580000000001s)]
*  and then you're watching college shoots, [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4484.26s)]
*  every year guys just look younger and younger and younger. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4485.660000000001s)]
*  So I don't think he's on the Mount Rushmore of Duke face. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4488.3s)]
*  I think that's early Cherokee Parks, [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4491.3s)]
*  maybe a little Quinn Snyder in there, [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4493.02s)]
*  maybe Grayson Allen, maybe Danny Ferry. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4495.06s)]
*  So I don't know if Kniepl can make that, [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4496.9800000000005s)]
*  but there's just a face. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4498.900000000001s)]
*  And it's not the same thing as Shamit Face, [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4500.9400000000005s)]
*  but I'm just projecting him maybe to be there one day. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4503.820000000001s)]
*  And it doesn't even mean that you can be good looking [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4506.700000000001s)]
*  and have Shamit Face. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4509.5s)]
*  It's a note when you see it. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4511.540000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4513.3s)]
*  Last award, the 2024 League Pass MVP award, [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4515.540000000001s)]
*  most reliably entertaining guy, [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4520.9s)]
*  day after day for six months. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4524.34s)]
*  My winner is Nikola Jokic. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4527.42s)]
*  It's really the only winner, [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4530.94s)]
*  but I would offer up Ant if I had to offer up somebody else. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4532.54s)]
*  As like an alternative, [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4536.9s)]
*  like independent spirit awards kind of winner? [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4538.0199999999995s)]
*  If you can't have Jokic, they go with Ant. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4541.82s)]
*  Even the Sixers closed the other night. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4544.7s)]
*  It was awesome. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4547.5s)]
*  The shots that he was hitting [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4548.94s)]
*  in the double overtime win against Denver. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4550.179999999999s)]
*  I don't know what it is about the threes [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4552.58s)]
*  when they matter the most. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4554.46s)]
*  It's almost like a pitcher who cranks, [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4555.54s)]
*  and it's not what he's doing, [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4557.94s)]
*  but it's like the shot goes in with more velocity [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4559.299999999999s)]
*  than it's supposed to on the ones that really matter. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4561.54s)]
*  There's a crispness to his shot and his athleticism [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4564.379999999999s)]
*  and the way that it goes in that's visually appealing. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4568.339999999999s)]
*  It's funny you mentioned this [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4573.0199999999995s)]
*  because it's not a rational confidence [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4574.099999999999s)]
*  because he's rational and confident. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4577.42s)]
*  But I do think if it's 1-8 and it's OKC Minnesota, [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4579.86s)]
*  I think out of anybody in the league, [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4584.54s)]
*  he's the one who would go into that series going, [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4586.86s)]
*  I don't care what the record is, [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4588.78s)]
*  I'm better than everybody in that team, [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4589.86s)]
*  and really genuinely, truly believe it, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4591.3s)]
*  which has been really fun to watch. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4594.62s)]
*  And he's had some great last three minutes of the game [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4595.9400000000005s)]
*  kind of turning it up a notch stuff. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4600.54s)]
*  How old is he now, 23? [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4604.14s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4606.66s)]
*  I think he's 23. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4607.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good one. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4608.34s)]
*  But this Jokic season, [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4611.58s)]
*  and it doesn't look like he's going to win the MVP, [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4614.62s)]
*  but holy shit, man. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4616.66s)]
*  There's been 10 games from him this year [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4619.26s)]
*  that you're just like, [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4621.22s)]
*  I just can't believe somebody's doing this. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4622.0599999999995s)]
*  Like when you go look at the Wiltshits stats [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4624.94s)]
*  on basketball reference, like, oh my God. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4627.5s)]
*  It wasn't just a 50-point a game here. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4630.74s)]
*  There was this other season he had 44 a game. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4632.46s)]
*  Like, what was that like to watch that? [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4635.219999999999s)]
*  Not that Jokic is putting up points like that, [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4637.099999999999s)]
*  but just the day-to-day, [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4638.9s)]
*  like it honestly feels like any box score is conceivable. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4640.5s)]
*  He's had box scores where like, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4644.58s)]
*  there's no way anyone in basketball could ever have this. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4645.9s)]
*  And he's had five of those this year. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4648.58s)]
*  But then when you watch how he's, [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4651.0599999999995s)]
*  just how he does everything for them, [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4653.139999999999s)]
*  like he's their only real rebounder. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4654.74s)]
*  He runs the offense. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4656.9s)]
*  He scores all their stuff in crunch time. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4658.62s)]
*  He sets up everybody else, like everything he does. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4660.78s)]
*  It's just, I've never seen anything like it day-to-day. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4663.46s)]
*  We didn't have league pass in the 80s [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4666.9800000000005s)]
*  for the great players of that era. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4668.7s)]
*  And we only got to watch Jordan when he was on TNT. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4670.78s)]
*  We didn't get to watch this night after night. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4674.46s)]
*  This is fucking crazy. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4676.06s)]
*  I'm seeing, I look, [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4679.18s)]
*  sounds like somebody's leaning Jokic. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4681.22s)]
*  I'm not leaning anywhere yet. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4686.22s)]
*  I'm keeping an open mind to the last week of the season. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4687.74s)]
*  It's really tough for me not to vote [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4690.74s)]
*  for somebody who's going to win 68 games [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4692.34s)]
*  and have one of the great guard seasons [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4695.3s)]
*  in the history of the position offensively. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4696.82s)]
*  Especially when I, you know, I try to value the winning piece. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4700.42s)]
*  If he's going to win 20 more games to Denver. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4703.9800000000005s)]
*  But I, the more I stare at this, [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4705.9400000000005s)]
*  that 60-10 game like broke my brain. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4708.06s)]
*  That was unbelievable. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4712.7s)]
*  I've never, have you ever seen somebody just get the ball [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4714.14s)]
*  25 feet from the basket [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4716.78s)]
*  and the other team knew what he was going to do [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4718.38s)]
*  and he would still back around [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4720.42s)]
*  and just get like a three-foot sky hook? [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4721.74s)]
*  Like what the fuck? [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4723.46s)]
*  I know there are missing some guys in Minnesota, [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4725.3s)]
*  but I just thought that game was just nuts. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4727.139999999999s)]
*  Wasn't just the points. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4729.74s)]
*  It was how he was getting the points [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4730.94s)]
*  and how easily he was doing everything. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4732.42s)]
*  It was nuts to watch. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4734.099999999999s)]
*  That's where whenever I hear anybody just knocking him, [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4735.74s)]
*  I lose my mind because you go, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4738.5s)]
*  he's in control of everything that's happening. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4740.46s)]
*  Like everything that's happening. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4743.179999999999s)]
*  And then the understanding, [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4744.86s)]
*  I forget what the number was. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4747.179999999999s)]
*  I don't know if it was hardened to Zubot for number one, [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4748.74s)]
*  but it was like who has the most field goals [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4751.74s)]
*  that are assisted or something. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4755.74s)]
*  And like Christian Brown is number two in the NBA. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4757.0599999999995s)]
*  Christian Brown, clearly because Denver hasn't done a good job [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4759.94s)]
*  with his roster, maximizing it, [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4763.5s)]
*  maybe the way others should. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4765.94s)]
*  I also wonder like if Jokic were different, [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4767.219999999999s)]
*  would there have already been some other star player [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4769.219999999999s)]
*  that went through AAU with Jokic and goes, [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4771.3s)]
*  hey, I'm going to come up there and play with Denver. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4774.26s)]
*  It's getting alarming because of the rings rule for Jokic [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4777.3s)]
*  where it's like, are we going to be allowed to appreciate him? [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4780.1s)]
*  I know we've already touched on some of this other stuff, [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4783.02s)]
*  but he's just orchestrating all of it that's happening [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4785.34s)]
*  and he doesn't want to shoot 30 times. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4789.34s)]
*  He doesn't want to pull up from three as much as he can. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4791.7s)]
*  It almost feels like Nash, [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4793.82s)]
*  where Nash would have these games. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4794.9400000000005s)]
*  You're like, how come you're not shooting more? [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4796.3s)]
*  Like what's going on? [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4797.7s)]
*  And it's just the way he's wired to play basketball [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4798.54s)]
*  is still somebody that wants all of it [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4800.9400000000005s)]
*  to kind of connect and work together. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4802.78s)]
*  And that's why I can't fathom why guys who played [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4804.1s)]
*  can watch these games and then find a way to shit on it. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4807.9800000000005s)]
*  But whatever, I mean, this kind of normal now [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4811.54s)]
*  with the former player stuff. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4814.9400000000005s)]
*  But yeah, look, really good, not top 20. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4816.1s)]
*  22 to 20. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4820.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4821.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean that Bob Pettit range. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4822.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, probably, you know, DeBusher. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4824.780000000001s)]
*  All right, those are our made up NBA words for 2025. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4827.26s)]
*  Congrats to all the winners and the nominees. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwXQvER3MyU&t=4831.26s)]
