# Bill Simmons Fixes the NBA Cup  With Wosny Lambre and Joe House  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [December 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA)
*  Big Waz is here, he was just in Las Vegas [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=0.0s)]
*  for the NBA Cup, which is it still going [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=3.08s)]
*  or is it finally over? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=6.24s)]
*  It's... [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=8.0s)]
*  I mean, I was only there for the semifinals, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=8.84s)]
*  I got back on Sunday, but it's done. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  The Bucs, I heard the Bucs won and Giannis played well. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=13.8s)]
*  Oh, is that what happened? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=17.48s)]
*  That's what I've been told, yeah. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=18.32s)]
*  So walk us through the Vegas piece of this [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=19.16s)]
*  and whether it's a good idea, because I really want us, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=21.76s)]
*  the three of us, to help the NBA. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  I think the NBA needs help in a bunch of different ways [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=28.2s)]
*  with their scheduling and some of their idea generation, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=30.68s)]
*  but what worked for you in Vegas [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=33.44s)]
*  and what didn't work for you? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=36.32s)]
*  I think I like the idea of having two games in one location, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=38.36s)]
*  sort of an all-day kind of basketball extravaganza. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=43.28s)]
*  Like, I personally enjoyed that aspect of it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=47.64s)]
*  The arena is pretty much up to snuff [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=52.0s)]
*  in terms of any normal NBA arena, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=55.0s)]
*  so just the kind of logistics of how it works [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=58.4s)]
*  as a basketball venue is completely fine. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=62.0s)]
*  So you felt like it was like March Madnessy a little bit. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=66.44s)]
*  Like, you go, there's two games in a row, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=69.24s)]
*  the house is nodding happily. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=71.2s)]
*  100%. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=73.12s)]
*  I thought that was great. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=74.8s)]
*  I think what it reminded me of, honestly, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  especially early on in these games [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=80.28s)]
*  as they're sort of getting going, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=82.36s)]
*  was being at the dunk contest [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=84.4s)]
*  and the three-point contest in Indianapolis last year. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=86.64s)]
*  It's like, you know, I'm here to watch, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=90.8s)]
*  but like nobody, it feels like nobody there [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=93.64s)]
*  is very impassioned. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=97.0s)]
*  It's like, you know, neutral observers, basically. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=98.2s)]
*  But as the games get going [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=102.24s)]
*  and the result gets closer to being finalized, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=104.52s)]
*  people got into it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=107.84s)]
*  It's just because there's not a lot of partisans there, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  that's what the atmosphere felt like. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=113.12s)]
*  It felt like, you know, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=116.44s)]
*  when I was watching the three-point contest last year, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=117.8s)]
*  until Steph and Ionescu got to the finals, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=120.72s)]
*  there wasn't that much juice watching it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=124.16s)]
*  But like, once it's like, whoa, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=127.08s)]
*  Steph might lose to a WNBA player, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=129.08s)]
*  the energy sort of got ratcheted up. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=131.96s)]
*  And I think that's kind of what it felt like being in Vegas [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=134.28s)]
*  is like early on in the game, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=137.96s)]
*  the crowd is like, everybody's sort of getting settled in. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=139.24s)]
*  And then when you notice that like, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=142.16s)]
*  all right, the game's in the balance, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=143.68s)]
*  people were really into it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=145.4s)]
*  How's the finals watching on TV? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  It reminded me, not a little of the bubble. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=150.12s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=154.72s)]
*  Where the crowd was like blacked out. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=155.8s)]
*  I couldn't really tell if the audio was bad [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  or if people were just in a coma. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=160.56s)]
*  I couldn't tell how many people were there. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=162.24s)]
*  And Ionescu was just killing it, obviously. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=164.60000000000002s)]
*  He killed it the whole time he was there. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=167.04s)]
*  But it just, something about it doesn't work. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=168.6s)]
*  I'm sure it works if you're there, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=172.2s)]
*  if you work for the league, if you're in the teams. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=173.68s)]
*  It's like, this is great, we're all here. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=175.48s)]
*  But I feel like there's a better idea. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=176.8s)]
*  So where'd you stand just on the semis and the finals? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=179.24s)]
*  Well, there's two things at work. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=182.2s)]
*  In the first place, the games were rock fights. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=184.88s)]
*  I mean, the shooting across the board [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=187.2s)]
*  in the semis and the finals was bad. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=189.48s)]
*  And you know, Oklahoma City going five for 32 from three, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=191.8s)]
*  that's not pleasing to the eye. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=195.48s)]
*  They were all unders. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=197.60000000000002s)]
*  If you were gambling on this and playing on the unders, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=198.44s)]
*  you're quite happy with outcomes. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=201.36s)]
*  But Woz really hit the key point, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=203.48000000000002s)]
*  which is how can you get the partisans there? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=206.96s)]
*  How can you get the fans that will show up with the passion? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  And this is the difference between this year's iteration [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=213.24s)]
*  and last year with the Lakers, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=217.68s)]
*  the Lakers had an easy, easy, easy way to import, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=219.16000000000003s)]
*  you know, a bunch of enthusiasm. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=223.12s)]
*  And it was very cool because it was the first one. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=225.08s)]
*  How can you get, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=228.0s)]
*  this is why I was shaking my head enthusiastically [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=228.84s)]
*  around the idea of this being kind of like an NCAA deal. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=231.44000000000003s)]
*  The difference is there's big chunks of fan bases [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=236.04000000000002s)]
*  that have traveled to that place to root for their team. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=239.08s)]
*  So it's live from the tip. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=242.16000000000003s)]
*  How can we get that? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=245.32000000000002s)]
*  That's the part, yes, that I want to say. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=246.72000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and part of it for me is like, you know, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=248.56s)]
*  I've read and I've heard all of the hand-wringing, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=251.12s)]
*  like the bottom line is if the Knicks and Warriors [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=253.36s)]
*  were in this final, there would have been an atmosphere. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=256.6s)]
*  It would have been, you know, a huge deal. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=259.24s)]
*  But we didn't get that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=261.76s)]
*  We got the Bucs and OKC. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=262.8s)]
*  These are not two national brands. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=265.36s)]
*  These are not two, you know, fan bases [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=267.92s)]
*  that have massive like fan bases all over the country. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=270.92s)]
*  The way the Knicks and the Lakers do like, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=274.64s)]
*  you know, if you've ever been to a Hawks game [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=277.0s)]
*  when the Knicks are playing them, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=278.88s)]
*  it's half Knick fans in there. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=280.68s)]
*  Same when you go to when the Lakers play in places [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=283.0s)]
*  like Phoenix and Denver. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=287.16s)]
*  It's like a bunch of Laker fans there. Right. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=289.08000000000004s)]
*  And so, you know, the two teams in there, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=291.8s)]
*  I think was problematic for me personally. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=294.20000000000005s)]
*  And I'm not somebody who's ever like, you know, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=296.56s)]
*  given Adam Silver his props. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=299.08000000000004s)]
*  I think the teams played hard. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=301.0s)]
*  The teams played like as if there were stakes. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  All the ancillary stuff, I think, needs to be figured out. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=306.72s)]
*  But the most important thing that the players cared [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=309.44s)]
*  and tried their best, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=313.48s)]
*  I think that's the biggest sort of takeaway for me. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=315.56s)]
*  Well, that's why I care about this as a topic, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=318.24s)]
*  because fundamentally, the premise behind the tournament [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=320.2s)]
*  works because the games are more fun to watch. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=323.28s)]
*  So you start there. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=325.16s)]
*  You said something that I think is a bad sign for the league [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=327.08s)]
*  and maybe ties into the stuff I did on Tuesday on my pod. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=330.6s)]
*  Oklahoma City is the best team in the West, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=334.84s)]
*  and they have Shea, who's the fourth best player [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=337.32s)]
*  in the world or the fifth best player in the world, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=340.28000000000003s)]
*  depending on what your rankings are. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=341.04s)]
*  Giannis is the second best player in the world, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=343.40000000000003s)]
*  maybe the first best player, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=346.76s)]
*  if you want to have the Yoko Giannis conversation. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=348.12s)]
*  I don't want to do that here. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=350.24s)]
*  And is playing out of his mind [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=351.44s)]
*  and is the most fun version of him [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=352.8s)]
*  that he's been in a game. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=354.52000000000004s)]
*  So on paper, it's a great matchup, Oklahoma City, Milwaukee. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=356.08000000000004s)]
*  And yet you laid out like, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=360.72s)]
*  oh, it's too bad the Knicks weren't in there. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=361.76s)]
*  It's too bad the Warriors aren't in there. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=363.2s)]
*  Maybe that's just what the league is. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=364.92s)]
*  Like, and even when I was going back [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=366.56s)]
*  and trying to figure out all the unicorn situations [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=368.84s)]
*  that have happened over the years, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=371.28s)]
*  almost every time it's somebody in a big market, right? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=374.28s)]
*  It's Magic and Bird, Boston, LA. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=377.35999999999996s)]
*  It's Michael Jordan in Chicago. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=380.76s)]
*  It's Kobe and Shaq in LA. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=382.88s)]
*  It's Curry and the Warriors happening [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=385.64s)]
*  in San Francisco in the Bay Area. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=388.91999999999996s)]
*  The only real time where we had a marquee kind of thing [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=391.35999999999996s)]
*  was LeBron in Miami and Cleveland. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=394.71999999999997s)]
*  And LeBron almost became like his own franchise [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=397.56s)]
*  to some degree because he became so big. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=399.91999999999996s)]
*  But House, just structurally, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=402.88s)]
*  if we put the semifinals in New York [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=407.35999999999996s)]
*  and either you had both games at MSG [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=411.88s)]
*  or you had one game at Barclays [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=413.91999999999996s)]
*  and the other game at MSG and it had to be, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=415.59999999999997s)]
*  you could hustle back and forth and potentially get both. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=417.35999999999996s)]
*  And then you had the finals two days later at MSG. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=421.0s)]
*  And now we have celebrities. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=424.96s)]
*  Now it's way easier for people to come in and out. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=426.96000000000004s)]
*  Now there's vibe and energy and we're playing it [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=429.52000000000004s)]
*  in the most famous basketball arena we have. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=432.44s)]
*  Isn't that just better? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=435.6s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=438.68s)]
*  Because we were very, very close to having this be [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=440.96000000000004s)]
*  the Hawks against the Rockets. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  Like Saturday, that was a viable possibility. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=445.72s)]
*  New York fans would have showed up for that. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=448.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=450.52000000000004s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=451.36s)]
*  Like I don't think that Vegas is a bad choice as a venue [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=456.64s)]
*  because it delivers the promise of other entertainment. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=461.16s)]
*  New York is hard, especially in- [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=468.28000000000003s)]
*  Is that what we're calling it now, entertainment? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=469.64s)]
*  You mean like adult entertainment? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=472.64s)]
*  We're old enough now to talk about these things [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=474.28000000000003s)]
*  in ways that keep it light. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=477.84000000000003s)]
*  But I don't know, New York in December, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=480.48s)]
*  that's a whole thing, right? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=483.36s)]
*  Like everybody's up in New York right now. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=485.16s)]
*  That's fair. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=486.88s)]
*  Because the time is marvelous. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=487.72s)]
*  But that leads to the second part of the question is, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=489.76s)]
*  is December the right time to have the NBA Cup? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=492.08000000000004s)]
*  I think that's a great question, honestly. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=496.44s)]
*  I think part of the thinking is like we want to really [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=499.44s)]
*  juice and goose attention on very early NBA games, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=502.28000000000003s)]
*  which traditionally people just didn't gravitate towards [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=507.12s)]
*  because obviously, and like people need to understand [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=511.68s)]
*  that no matter what the NBA Cup does or is, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=514.64s)]
*  it's not gonna be as popular as football. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=517.12s)]
*  Like we need to let go of that as even a concept or an idea. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=519.6800000000001s)]
*  Like Americans love football more than they do basketball. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=525.0s)]
*  And that's okay. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=529.24s)]
*  A lot more. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=530.28s)]
*  A lot more. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=531.36s)]
*  And that's okay. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=532.76s)]
*  I just think it's about one, the Yanis and Shay thing. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=533.92s)]
*  And I've talked about this on group chat. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=540.24s)]
*  I think David Stern's dream of these hyper-corporatized, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=543.5999999999999s)]
*  focused group to death athletes, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=549.0s)]
*  they don't get busted for weed. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=551.4399999999999s)]
*  They don't scare corporate America. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=553.4s)]
*  They are the perfect corporate automatons. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=555.68s)]
*  But guess what? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=559.04s)]
*  People are not attracted to that. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=560.04s)]
*  They're not compelling figures. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=562.04s)]
*  Even Nike and Yanis, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=564.52s)]
*  like selling Yanis as this cute, cuddly teddy bear, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=565.84s)]
*  that's just a mistake. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=569.44s)]
*  Nobody knows a single thing about Shay Gilder's Alexander [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=570.6s)]
*  except that he wears funny clothes. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=574.24s)]
*  That's it. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=576.0400000000001s)]
*  And he does interviews with 11 of his teammates. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=576.88s)]
*  That's it. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=579.36s)]
*  Nobody knows anything about these guys. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=580.2s)]
*  Yeah, Yanis had that clip when he, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=582.64s)]
*  that from 2015 when he, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=585.28s)]
*  the Bucks and the Bulls had that series [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=587.76s)]
*  and he got mad at Mike Dunleavy [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=589.8000000000001s)]
*  for a 50 foot charge and just knocked him into the first row. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=591.6s)]
*  Like Yanis is not just a cuddly dude. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=595.16s)]
*  That dude has an edge that they try to pretend he doesn't. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=597.8s)]
*  I don't know why they would pretend he doesn't. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=601.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, that's the angle to play up. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=603.72s)]
*  I mean, part of the thing that you guys are talking about [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=605.32s)]
*  is the league's affirmative choice [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=607.8s)]
*  about how it's gonna market this season, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=609.96s)]
*  which is a transition season. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=612.76s)]
*  And you captured it, BS, on your pod earlier this week. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=615.16s)]
*  They have chosen as a, from a marketing standpoint [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=618.56s)]
*  to give glory to this exiting, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=622.1999999999999s)]
*  exiting quickly class of superstars [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=625.8399999999999s)]
*  that have defined the league over the past 10 to 15 years [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=628.5999999999999s)]
*  at the expense of a player like SGA. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=631.76s)]
*  Like, you know. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=634.4799999999999s)]
*  Or Tatum or Tyrese Halliburton [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=635.8399999999999s)]
*  or all these dudes in their 20s [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=637.92s)]
*  that they should be trying to elevate. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=639.52s)]
*  Yeah. Yes. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=641.5999999999999s)]
*  Right. Exactly. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=642.4399999999999s)]
*  You know, what's SGA's defining moment? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=644.4399999999999s)]
*  Ask, and we're NBA heads, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=646.8399999999999s)]
*  but ask anybody in an NBA kind of community. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=649.52s)]
*  Tell me SGA's, you know, the clutch thing that's happened. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=651.3199999999999s)]
*  Giannis, I love, there's a moment here [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=654.92s)]
*  to really go ahead and lean into where he's at, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=657.04s)]
*  which is averaging 21 and a half points per game [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=660.64s)]
*  in the paint, which hasn't been seen since Shaq in 99-2000. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=664.8s)]
*  We talked about Giannis and his potential [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=669.84s)]
*  of replacing Shaq at that point. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=672.0799999999999s)]
*  Let's do that. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=673.76s)]
*  Let's make that be Giannis. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=674.6s)]
*  Giannis, we know. That's a great point. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=676.3199999999999s)]
*  Giannis has a ring. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=677.52s)]
*  Let's go with Giannis. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=678.52s)]
*  It just feels like there's two things that they did was [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=680.04s)]
*  that I just, the more I look at it, I just don't like. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=683.16s)]
*  One is they could have used the Olympics [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=686.0799999999999s)]
*  and even like the Netflix Starting Five show. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=687.92s)]
*  Like, just push new people. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=690.0799999999999s)]
*  Push, like, put the fucking Wagner's on Starting Five. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=691.96s)]
*  Let's hang out with those goofy Germans [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=694.56s)]
*  and see what their life is like. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=697.0s)]
*  Like, let's try to develop new people. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=698.1999999999999s)]
*  And then the Olympics, same thing. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=701.0s)]
*  Should anyone over 30 even be on the Olympic team? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=702.24s)]
*  Maybe we should have, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=705.36s)]
*  it should be all like, you know, younger players [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=707.16s)]
*  or in their prime players or guys trying to have a moment. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=709.8399999999999s)]
*  Because we were in this situation [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=712.7199999999999s)]
*  in the beginning of the 2010s with Durant and Russ. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=714.9599999999999s)]
*  And remember, it was the same conversations about, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=718.8399999999999s)]
*  well, who wants to watch OKC? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=720.68s)]
*  It's a whole bunch of young team. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=722.24s)]
*  They should be putting LeBron on and Kobe [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=723.8399999999999s)]
*  and the Celtics and Carmelo. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=726.1999999999999s)]
*  And meanwhile, all the real basketball people were like, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=728.28s)]
*  I fucking love watching that OKC team, right? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=730.28s)]
*  And then it took a while, took a while. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=732.4s)]
*  Finally, 2014, when they played the Spurs, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=733.88s)]
*  it felt like we had enough history with OKC [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=736.92s)]
*  and they became a thing. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=738.92s)]
*  But I don't know why they don't push the younger guys more, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=740.8s)]
*  why they're so beholden to the guys who have already done it. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=744.88s)]
*  And to me, it's just about ratings, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=748.4799999999999s)]
*  but the ratings are going down, so it's not working. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=750.76s)]
*  Yeah, look, I agree with you on the Netflix front. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=753.88s)]
*  Look, sorry, Bill, but Jason Tatum went on that damn show [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=758.3199999999999s)]
*  and said he loves his mom, he loves his son, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=761.52s)]
*  and he loves the whole... [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=764.5999999999999s)]
*  I could have told you he was going to be born on that. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=765.4399999999999s)]
*  That was just misery in terms of selling this product [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=766.96s)]
*  and being like, these are compelling guys, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=771.5600000000001s)]
*  interesting people, great athletes. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=773.64s)]
*  This man went up there and said he loves his mom, his son, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=775.9200000000001s)]
*  and he hoops really hard. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=778.84s)]
*  Like, it's just not going to work. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=780.16s)]
*  And, you know, again, and I'll say this again, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=782.0s)]
*  their most popular young guy was who? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=784.64s)]
*  John Moran. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=787.96s)]
*  Right, yeah, we talked about all this. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=789.0s)]
*  And bottom line is Nike and them did not get their hooks [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=790.72s)]
*  into him and turn him into a corporate product [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=794.4s)]
*  since he was 12 years old, like they have [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=797.28s)]
*  the rest of these guys. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=799.96s)]
*  These dudes are so anodyne. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=801.32s)]
*  They don't say or do or look. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=803.6800000000001s)]
*  Nothing is interesting about these guys. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=806.8000000000001s)]
*  I enjoy watching them hoop. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=809.32s)]
*  As people, I'm completely uninspired. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=811.44s)]
*  There's just nothing there. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=816.04s)]
*  And, you know, again, the guys who are willing [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=817.4s)]
*  to be a little bit out there and different [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=819.96s)]
*  don't comport with how the league sees itself. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=822.48s)]
*  Like, how's this guy, Kyle Kuzma? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=825.68s)]
*  Hey, Kyle Kuzma's willing to say stuff in public. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=829.16s)]
*  That's what I mean. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=832.76s)]
*  I like that about Kuzma. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=833.6s)]
*  He's willing to say shit. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=834.4399999999999s)]
*  These other guys, like, I don't know, man. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=835.8s)]
*  They're just so afraid. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=838.0s)]
*  There's too much money at stake, Waston. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=839.16s)]
*  Of any backlash of any game. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=840.68s)]
*  Yeah, they don't want to jeopardize it. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=842.0s)]
*  It's just not fun. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=843.4399999999999s)]
*  So I'm thinking, like, with the cup, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=845.0s)]
*  what this ties into another thing that makes me mad [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=847.36s)]
*  is they're so afraid of football [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=850.8000000000001s)]
*  to the point they take inside the NBA, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=854.1600000000001s)]
*  which is just the Thursday show. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=856.72s)]
*  On Thursday nights, I watch the NBA, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=858.72s)]
*  and they're like, we have to move it away from football. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=860.8000000000001s)]
*  Football's eating our lunch. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=862.6800000000001s)]
*  They move it to Tuesdays. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=863.8000000000001s)]
*  Doesn't feel the same. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=865.2800000000001s)]
*  They have this NBA Cup. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=866.76s)]
*  They decide the semifinals are gonna be Saturday, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=868.52s)]
*  because it's the one day we can kind of get away [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=871.2s)]
*  with not going against football. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=873.24s)]
*  And then they keep everybody there for three fucking days, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=874.84s)]
*  because they don't want to go against [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=877.2800000000001s)]
*  a Monday night doubleheader, which, by the way, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=878.6800000000001s)]
*  was Minnesota against Chicago and Kurt Cousins' corpse [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=881.24s)]
*  against the shitty Raiders team. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=885.6800000000001s)]
*  It's like, why are you afraid of that for? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=887.2800000000001s)]
*  Maybe go try to beat them head to head, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=888.6800000000001s)]
*  but they're doing all this stuff where they're just retreating [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=890.5200000000001s)]
*  and they're so scared of the NFL. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=893.4000000000001s)]
*  And meanwhile, it's like, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=896.1600000000001s)]
*  maybe you should try to throw some counter punches. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=897.72s)]
*  The NFL's gonna beat you either way. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=901.5200000000001s)]
*  Even the WNBA, which we thought it was all crazy, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=903.08s)]
*  the WNBA playoffs are going head to head against the NFL. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=905.44s)]
*  Guess what? They did okay. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=908.0799999999999s)]
*  They had fans. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=909.76s)]
*  People had their own fan base and people watched that shit. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=910.76s)]
*  So, House, why are they so scared? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=914.7199999999999s)]
*  I just feel like when you operate from fear, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=917.24s)]
*  you're gonna lose every single time. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=919.9599999999999s)]
*  See, I don't know that I subscribe to the idea [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=921.9599999999999s)]
*  that they're operating from fear, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=924.12s)]
*  because they did stick this cup into the portion [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=925.5999999999999s)]
*  of the NFL season that is like really, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=929.68s)]
*  we're deciding playoff outcomes now. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=932.68s)]
*  And they are on nights of the week [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=935.4399999999999s)]
*  when there isn't necessarily NFL. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=937.48s)]
*  Now, I don't like the fact that inside the NBA is on Tuesday. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=939.84s)]
*  And the Amazon games are fine, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=943.72s)]
*  but none of that Thursday night football is musty TV for me. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=946.48s)]
*  Hold your spot. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=950.48s)]
*  But here's the real problem, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=951.48s)]
*  and they're never gonna do this. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=953.4s)]
*  The stupid season shouldn't start until Christmas. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=955.6s)]
*  And the NBA Cup in February would be effing magnificent [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=958.08s)]
*  because football is diminishing starting on Christmas day, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=961.6800000000001s)]
*  basically. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=966.48s)]
*  We're getting less and less games, the playoff start, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=967.2800000000001s)]
*  and during the week, you have full run [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=969.96s)]
*  to go do whatever you want. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=972.8800000000001s)]
*  So taking the whole thing and starting in Christmas time, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=974.32s)]
*  New Year's, and then let's take over the season [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=977.5600000000001s)]
*  as football goes away. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=982.08s)]
*  That's what makes the most sense. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=983.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you're talking 70 game schedule [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=985.12s)]
*  instead of starting near the end of October. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=987.5200000000001s)]
*  You're starting maybe like third week in November, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=990.32s)]
*  you're easing into it, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=993.5600000000001s)]
*  and then you really kick into year on Christmas. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=994.72s)]
*  Because one of the things I was thinking with the Cup was, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=996.64s)]
*  you made the point earlier, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=998.9200000000001s)]
*  the games are all really fun, the courts are fun, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=999.76s)]
*  but we only had four games [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1003.0400000000001s)]
*  in this super complicated scoring system [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1005.12s)]
*  trying to lead to, oh, and then these four teams made it, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1008.0400000000001s)]
*  and this team didn't make it [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1010.9200000000001s)]
*  because their point differential was plus 36. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1012.0400000000001s)]
*  How about this, have more fucking games. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1014.52s)]
*  Like instead of four NBA Cups, let's have six, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1016.9200000000001s)]
*  let's have seven, let's get it so that it goes [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1020.48s)]
*  all the way through, and then we get to January, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1023.7199999999999s)]
*  and then the week to do it, in my opinion, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1025.48s)]
*  there's that week between the conference title game [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1028.04s)]
*  and the Super Bowl. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1031.72s)]
*  It's a dead week. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1032.8799999999999s)]
*  Nothing's happening. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1034.12s)]
*  Football has finally calmed down, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1035.1599999999999s)]
*  basically starting Sunday night, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1036.8s)]
*  and just try to own that week. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1038.8s)]
*  You basically have a clean slate. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1042.56s)]
*  You're going against nothing. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1044.24s)]
*  You're not going against college football, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1045.8s)]
*  you're not going against anything, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1046.9199999999998s)]
*  and make that the signature week. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1048.56s)]
*  They're going the opposite way. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1049.9199999999998s)]
*  Not only do they wrap up all this stuff, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1051.48s)]
*  but the trade deadline is on the Thursday [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1053.16s)]
*  of Super Bowl week. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1055.0s)]
*  That's another one I don't get. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1055.92s)]
*  The trade deadline's one of the most fun days of the season. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1057.72s)]
*  You're just burying it in the Super Bowl [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1060.52s)]
*  when all your media members, all your corporate, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1063.1200000000001s)]
*  everybody is just talking football, football, football. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1065.2s)]
*  So, Waz, to me, this is just easy structural stuff [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1068.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't get. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1072.2s)]
*  Yeah, the thing about more cup games, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1073.16s)]
*  it will make it so that it makes it easier [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1075.48s)]
*  for the best teams to actually play [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1077.8000000000002s)]
*  in the further rounds to actually advance, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1080.3200000000002s)]
*  and so you probably wouldn't get an Atlanta in there, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1083.44s)]
*  although I love watching Atlanta. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1086.76s)]
*  Or would you, because maybe Atlanta's one of the best teams [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1089.72s)]
*  in the East, Waz, maybe you would get Atlanta. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1092.36s)]
*  Hey, that's fair. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1095.6399999999999s)]
*  And yeah, again, I do think fixing the window [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1098.04s)]
*  that they put it in, but to me, it's a promotion issue. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1103.12s)]
*  Like, Adam Silver needs to get his Don King hat on. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1107.1599999999999s)]
*  Waz is just not a promoter. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1111.24s)]
*  He does not know, they just don't know, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1113.4s)]
*  and maybe it's the networks, I don't know. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1115.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1118.0s)]
*  They don't know how to eventize these products, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1118.84s)]
*  and that, to me, is the main issue. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1122.64s)]
*  People don't see these things as essential viewing. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1125.44s)]
*  They know the season is 82 games long. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1129.16s)]
*  They know that, effectively, a loss in January [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1133.36s)]
*  is just like, ho hum, who cares? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1136.52s)]
*  Every single game doesn't matter, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1139.16s)]
*  and the league just needs to be better, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1141.84s)]
*  more effective at promoting their product, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1144.2s)]
*  getting people to feel like this is essential. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1147.24s)]
*  Because the idea that people aren't interested in the NBA, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1150.04s)]
*  I think, is BS. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1152.68s)]
*  I think plenty of people are still interested. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1154.32s)]
*  Obviously, the highlights, the recaps, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1157.36s)]
*  they do numbers online. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1159.6s)]
*  People still wanna know about the results [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1161.6s)]
*  and all of that stuff. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1164.2s)]
*  It's just the NBA needs to impress upon people [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1165.1599999999999s)]
*  that these games are worthy of their time, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1169.12s)]
*  worthy of their commitment. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1172.2399999999998s)]
*  Well, House, I mean, we go so far back. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1173.8799999999999s)]
*  We remember when USA and ESPN started showing cable games, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1176.52s)]
*  right, and we were like, oh. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1181.04s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1184.28s)]
*  All the teams. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1185.32s)]
*  Oh my God, that's what a Clippers Arena looks like. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1187.4399999999998s)]
*  You just, you had no idea. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1190.6s)]
*  And then the Sports Center highlights [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1192.52s)]
*  are taking off at the same time, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1194.0s)]
*  and we were just so starved for any sort of NBA action. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1195.32s)]
*  Now it's flipped the other way, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1199.24s)]
*  where it's like having the most full fridge possible. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1200.3999999999999s)]
*  I was telling somebody the other day, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1204.12s)]
*  I feel like I watch as much basketball as I ever did, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1206.36s)]
*  but I watch it completely differently now. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1209.68s)]
*  I don't care if I see the ESPN game on Wednesday night [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1211.48s)]
*  as it's happening, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1214.0s)]
*  but what I do is I try to watch [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1215.16s)]
*  as many fourth quarters as I can. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1217.04s)]
*  Or if I'll look at the game recap and it'll be like, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1219.68s)]
*  oh, Houston did, had a 37 to 10 run [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1223.72s)]
*  in the second quarter on Wednesday. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1226.3200000000002s)]
*  I'm like, all right, I'm gonna watch that, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1227.8s)]
*  and I'll just queue it up. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1229.16s)]
*  And it's so much more on demand. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1231.0s)]
*  And House, I don't feel like that reflects in the ratings. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1232.76s)]
*  So when they say the ratings are down, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1235.72s)]
*  I'm not positive, I believe it. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1237.96s)]
*  I do think that they have a star issue, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1239.48s)]
*  which I talked about Tuesday. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1241.72s)]
*  They don't, like, House and I didn't miss Michael Jordan [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1243.0s)]
*  in the 90s when he played a playoff game. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1246.5600000000002s)]
*  It was just, it was non-negotiable. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1248.64s)]
*  You didn't miss Jordan in the playoffs, period, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1251.68s)]
*  unless you had a substantial event that superseded it. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1254.48s)]
*  Otherwise, you watched Jordan. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1259.48s)]
*  They don't have a guy like that now. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1260.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's LeBron. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1263.4s)]
*  It's supposed to be LeBron, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1266.04s)]
*  except for where we're on at 40. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1267.28s)]
*  Come on. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1269.1200000000001s)]
*  It's not LeBron at 40. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1269.96s)]
*  It's not at year 22, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1270.8s)]
*  and it's not really Curry either. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1271.64s)]
*  That's right, but those are the guys on television. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1273.88s)]
*  Look at the schedule. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1276.16s)]
*  Look at the ABC schedule. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1277.04s)]
*  I think the hard thing is nobody sits down [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1280.48s)]
*  and watches basketball games. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1285.8s)]
*  You don't sit down like, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1287.6s)]
*  oh, the game's about, let me go get in my chair, right? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1288.44s)]
*  It's not football. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1291.6399999999999s)]
*  And using linear TV ratings as a measuring stick [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1293.8s)]
*  for overall success is clearly outmoded, outdated, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1298.36s)]
*  makes no sense whatsoever. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1302.28s)]
*  The fact that the league signed an 11-year, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1303.92s)]
*  $76 billion deal means that those folks [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1306.88s)]
*  who are paying that money have ideas [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1311.44s)]
*  about how to capture eyeballs [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1313.44s)]
*  in the interest of those consumers [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1315.28s)]
*  to push their stuff that makes sense to them. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1317.52s)]
*  And they don't think that people are gonna come [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1320.44s)]
*  sit down in their chairs [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1322.8s)]
*  and watch a goddamn basketball game in February [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1324.2s)]
*  from the beginning of the game to the end of the game. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1327.4s)]
*  It's all the ways that we watch it. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1330.04s)]
*  It's what you and Derek Thompson talked about. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1331.96s)]
*  People consume the hell out of basketball, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1334.24s)]
*  but they don't consume it by sitting in a chair [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1337.68s)]
*  and watching it. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1340.28s)]
*  So it's a little bit of a false description, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1341.1200000000001s)]
*  false assessment to say, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1345.68s)]
*  well, yeah, the ratings are down. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1347.56s)]
*  Well, Wisewatches every Hawks game, so he's pretty bad. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1349.72s)]
*  I kinda do at this point. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1353.32s)]
*  He's kinda sick, actually. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1354.72s)]
*  He's got a Dyson Daniels bedspread. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1355.56s)]
*  Is it? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1357.24s)]
*  So I'm also a bit of a radical, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1358.08s)]
*  thinker on the schedule and stuff. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1364.88s)]
*  One, I don't even think 70 is enough of a cut. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1367.64s)]
*  I think it should be literally round robin. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1370.72s)]
*  You play each team one time at home, one time away, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1373.08s)]
*  two times a week. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1377.04s)]
*  So like 60. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1377.88s)]
*  So when we get expansion, it's like a 62 game schedule. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1379.1200000000001s)]
*  That's it. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1382.36s)]
*  One in one. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1383.2s)]
*  I sign up for that. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1384.2s)]
*  Everyone I've ever mentioned that [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1385.44s)]
*  who's in any sort of decision-making ownership, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1386.88s)]
*  they're all like, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1389.76s)]
*  don't even talk about that on a podcast. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1391.48s)]
*  It will never ever happen. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1393.16s)]
*  It's too much money. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1394.4s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1395.4s)]
*  And it's like, you guys already made all this money. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1396.24s)]
*  And that's the point. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1398.24s)]
*  All of these owners who were told [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1400.3200000000002s)]
*  that the most visionary business people ever, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1402.24s)]
*  because they ran some hedge fund, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1405.0800000000002s)]
*  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1407.24s)]
*  they can't figure out how this extra shortfall in money [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1408.92s)]
*  that they got from this big, big ass 11-year contract [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1413.0s)]
*  from all of these networks, as House mentioned, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1417.0400000000002s)]
*  how reducing inventory and making it more scarce, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1420.4s)]
*  they can't figure out a way to monetize that. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1424.0s)]
*  I find that to be just baffling. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1426.4s)]
*  Another thing I think- [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1429.92s)]
*  But it does the competitiveness of the games. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1431.24s)]
*  Just there's more urgency because whatever. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1434.48s)]
*  It also makes the end of the regular season more interesting [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1437.2s)]
*  because if you have like a situation Philly's in now, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1440.2800000000002s)]
*  you might not even make the playoffs. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1444.0800000000002s)]
*  So like every game matters starting game 20. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1445.64s)]
*  100%. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1448.5600000000002s)]
*  And also I'm a bit radical on league pass. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1449.4s)]
*  I think we should abolish it. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1452.0800000000002s)]
*  This is my favorite WoZ take. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1454.6000000000001s)]
*  Get rid of- [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1456.1200000000001s)]
*  I haven't heard this. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1457.44s)]
*  Yeah, this is great. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1458.52s)]
*  Look, if you have to watch the NBA for work, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1459.3600000000001s)]
*  if people say, oh, that's self-serving for you, Woz, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1461.0800000000002s)]
*  whatever, I'm just saying. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1463.2s)]
*  If people have to watch it for work, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1464.76s)]
*  all right, we'll give you league pass. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1466.0800000000002s)]
*  If you want access to it, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1467.64s)]
*  we're charging you a crazy premium, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1468.88s)]
*  which to me, that means like whenever people want to watch [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1472.6000000000001s)]
*  the NBA, they gotta watch it with the league's partners. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1475.8400000000001s)]
*  I don't see what's so bad about that as an idea. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1480.0s)]
*  Because again, I grew up in a context of no league pass [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1482.8s)]
*  and was completely fine with Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1486.24s)]
*  and NBA on NBC. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1489.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1491.28s)]
*  Like I said- [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1492.24s)]
*  So you're saying like national games, you get your own team. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1493.0800000000002s)]
*  Like if you live like house in Washington, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1496.32s)]
*  he gets to still watch the Wizards. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1498.2s)]
*  And then maybe league pass- [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1500.16s)]
*  Yeah, you get your own team in your market. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1501.0s)]
*  Yeah, just like how the Jets and Giants [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1502.44s)]
*  got forced down my throat when I was living in New York. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1504.28s)]
*  But maybe you get to pick like three other teams. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1507.6s)]
*  And then if you want the whole package, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1510.84s)]
*  it's like a thousand dollars. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1513.48s)]
*  And it's just like completely prohibitive. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1515.08s)]
*  There's some idea there they're making it scarce. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1517.9599999999998s)]
*  I'm not against that house. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1521.6s)]
*  Or maybe they're just, that's it. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1523.4399999999998s)]
*  You get your own team. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1525.1999999999998s)]
*  You can pick three other league pass teams. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1526.52s)]
*  Other than that, just enjoy that. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1528.84s)]
*  No, we're not giving them three other teams. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1529.6799999999998s)]
*  You watch your local team. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1532.0s)]
*  You watch your local team and you watch your national team. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1534.04s)]
*  There's two days a week that NBA games are on. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1537.96s)]
*  Sergeant Wise, he's laying down the law. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1540.96s)]
*  That's it. That's it. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1543.28s)]
*  And also they do need to do something about the bootlegs. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1544.72s)]
*  I was talking to somebody who works in this sort of area [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1548.88s)]
*  in terms of how young people consume sports, specifically the NBA. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1552.8400000000001s)]
*  Like how it was explained to me, it's like how people of my age viewed Napster. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1557.0800000000002s)]
*  We're just like, once we found Napster and LimeWire and all this other stuff, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1562.52s)]
*  we literally stopped believing in the concept that we would go to Sam Goodie [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1567.3999999999999s)]
*  and buy a CD. It's like, no, I get this for free. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1571.04s)]
*  I'm not paying for it. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1573.96s)]
*  I don't have a ESPN subscription. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1575.52s)]
*  I damn sure don't got one a discovery. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1577.9199999999998s)]
*  I am just pilfering an illegal stream. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1581.1599999999999s)]
*  They need to find something to do about that. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1583.6799999999998s)]
*  And I know I can hear people right now saying, how many people could possibly [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1585.24s)]
*  be streaming stuff this way? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1588.6799999999998s)]
*  I'm telling you, it's a sizable amount of folks. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1590.12s)]
*  I think he's right. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1594.72s)]
*  I remember we did the. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1595.68s)]
*  The Juice World doc for HBO and Max, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1597.6000000000001s)]
*  and it was just like it just got pirated out of control. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1601.28s)]
*  And that was the first time I was like, oh, wow, this still was happening [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1605.24s)]
*  on like a major level. But you're right. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1608.48s)]
*  Especially as we head to this next era where you're going to need Amazon, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1610.92s)]
*  you need Peacock, you need cable to get ESPN or whatever the ESPN package is. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1614.6000000000001s)]
*  And you'll have to pay for the league pass stuff, too. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1620.28s)]
*  I mean, it's our job. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1622.96s)]
*  So we get all this stuff. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1624.16s)]
*  But yeah, I've said it a thousand hundred times. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1625.44s)]
*  The schedule is the number one way to fix this. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1630.6000000000001s)]
*  And they won't. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1632.92s)]
*  What a bullet. They just won't. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1633.8400000000001s)]
*  It would make it more special. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1635.1200000000001s)]
*  The guys would be playing. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1636.4s)]
*  They'd be healthier. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1638.1200000000001s)]
*  They wouldn't even also recently with this this weird bye week [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1639.52s)]
*  where there were no games and stuff. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1643.16s)]
*  I'd actually maybe miss the NBA. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1644.72s)]
*  I was like last night, where the fuck is the NBA? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1646.24s)]
*  Dude, and Doc said this in the pregame availability, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1648.4s)]
*  he said one of the cooler things about this is we had time [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1652.28s)]
*  to prepare for our opponent, almost like a playoff game. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1655.52s)]
*  Again, everything gets better when we're not stuffing [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1659.72s)]
*  all of these freaking games together, playing three games in five nights [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1663.6s)]
*  in three cities. Yeah. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1667.84s)]
*  This is a no brainer schedule. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1671.04s)]
*  It's a no brainer. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1673.6399999999999s)]
*  Everything would be better with less games. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1675.72s)]
*  Everybody. So maybe they'll get house. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1678.92s)]
*  Maybe they'll give some of the money back. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1680.2s)]
*  76, maybe it's 60. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1682.72s)]
*  I mean, this is the issue, right? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1685.64s)]
*  And I don't have a good solution for it. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1688.32s)]
*  It's easy for us to talk about less games. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1690.4s)]
*  There's the 41 home games for places where people actually go to the games, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1692.4s)]
*  not here in Washington, but in Ben places, cities where the team is relevant. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1697.16s)]
*  That's real money. That's revenue in that. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1701.24s)]
*  Yeah. Walking into the door, buying food, buying merch, you know, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1703.68s)]
*  populating the surrounding restaurants and bars and stuff. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1709.0s)]
*  It's an ecosystem that matters. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1713.4s)]
*  And, you know, how do you walk away from that? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1716.48s)]
*  How do you? Where's the right? It's beyond the franchise. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1720.0s)]
*  There's Sportico did this thing in the franchise values, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1722.76s)]
*  which I always think are corny because there's no real way to know. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1725.52s)]
*  It only takes one dumb person to be like, here's 11 billion. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1728.2s)]
*  But they had the pie chart of how the Celtics, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1732.48s)]
*  I think it was Sportico, maybe it was somebody else. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1735.04s)]
*  They had a pie chart of all the Celtics revenue [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1737.8000000000002s)]
*  because they don't know they're in an arena. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1740.68s)]
*  And they had it earmarked for the Celtics [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1742.8000000000002s)]
*  making one hundred and two million dollars from the playoffs. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1745.1200000000001s)]
*  Wow. Assuming they made, you know, got to like four rounds. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1748.5200000000002s)]
*  And you could see it was like, Jesus Christ, that's a crazy amount of money. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1751.8000000000002s)]
*  But, you know, that's part of why some of these bigger market teams, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1756.0400000000002s)]
*  they go all in on luxury tax because they feel like it's almost like a bet. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1759.24s)]
*  You know, can we make that money back the longer the rounds go? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1763.3200000000002s)]
*  If if they put me in charge, I would at least go to 70 games. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1766.6799999999998s)]
*  I mean, you could talk me into the 60 would be even better. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1771.32s)]
*  Sixty two, but they won't. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1774.1599999999999s)]
*  This is something Steve Kerr has been Steve Kerr at one point. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1775.6s)]
*  I think he like hand wrote a long letter to Adam Silver, like in the last year. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1779.0s)]
*  Like it was like the 1840s. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1784.1999999999998s)]
*  Like he's dear Adam. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1786.32s)]
*  It is Steve Kerr. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1788.48s)]
*  I'm here on the on the outskirts of Wyoming writing a letter with a feather and a pen. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1789.6399999999999s)]
*  But he wrote a letter like just like basically begging him to cut the schedule down. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1795.48s)]
*  And I remember talking to Doc about this last year when he got back in [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1799.8799999999999s)]
*  and he was trying to take over the Bucks and and he was just like, we just don't practice. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1802.7199999999998s)]
*  Like, like I just got here with our staffs change. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1807.9199999999998s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1811.8799999999999s)]
*  His Doc's teams just don't. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1812.28s)]
*  I was like, he's like, we still get to practice and I don't get to play as much golf. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1814.76s)]
*  No, he. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1819.36s)]
*  He. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1821.16s)]
*  But he was saying, and this is something any coach I've ever talked to, they always talk about this. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1821.48s)]
*  There's these schedule bumps where you just can't work on anything and you end up like in a hotel [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1826.64s)]
*  conference room in some banquet room running through like like how you're going to do, how you're [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1831.76s)]
*  going to charge the guy with the ball and shit like that. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1838.76s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1842.28s)]
*  All right. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1843.8000000000002s)]
*  So short term Vegas next year for this or no was? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1844.2s)]
*  I'm fine with Vegas, but they need to figure out a mechanism by which they can get the [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1849.0s)]
*  fans of the actual teams in those buildings. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1853.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1857.12s)]
*  I'm like, I haven't really put too much thought as to how they would go about doing this. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1858.12s)]
*  I'm again, I'm biased like you guys. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1862.52s)]
*  I love Vegas. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1865.52s)]
*  So I think it's a great place to host something like this past weekend. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1866.52s)]
*  It was also the freaking rodeo championships. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1871.52s)]
*  Shania Twain had a concert. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1874.28s)]
*  There were cowboy hats and entertainment. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1876.76s)]
*  It's just a great place to entertainment and event. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1879.76s)]
*  So maybe the answer if they, if they strung it out to six games instead of four, they moved it to [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1882.76s)]
*  January and they really, this is going to be a direct contradiction of what I said about not being [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1890.32s)]
*  being wusses about going against football, but you target that week between the conference [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1897.4s)]
*  championship and the Super Bowl, which we know is open every week. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1901.88s)]
*  We know what it is. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1904.72s)]
*  So this year would be February 2nd. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1905.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1908.72s)]
*  And we can make the tweak. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1909.72s)]
*  We can make the tweak be if we're going to spread it out, we can make the tweak be the semis end [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1910.72s)]
*  up being home, home arenas. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1916.72s)]
*  And then the final, you know, you make it a debt. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1918.72s)]
*  Not only do you make it, you know, the destination or whatever it is, there's enough space because [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1921.72s)]
*  I don't know why the semis and the finals have to be so freaking close to each other. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1928.72s)]
*  Like they don't do that in the Chechens league. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1933.76s)]
*  How about Tuesday's the quarterfinals? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1936.76s)]
*  Then we go to Vegas Friday, Sunday, the week before the Super Bowl. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1939.76s)]
*  And it's just Friday night doubleheader. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1944.76s)]
*  Sunday is the final. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1947.76s)]
*  Everyone just goes to Vegas one weekend. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1948.76s)]
*  You're in Thursday or Friday morning. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1950.76s)]
*  You're out Monday. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1952.76s)]
*  You're not going against football at all. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1953.76s)]
*  You have six games instead of four to determine exactly, you know, you're going to get the right [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1956.76s)]
*  order probably of the teams in some form. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1961.8s)]
*  You might have one outlier. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1963.8s)]
*  And the only thing we would know for sure is that the Washington Wizards won't be there. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1965.8s)]
*  Well, the reason that's great is because the buildup to it is occurring in the month of [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1969.8s)]
*  diminishing football. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1974.64s)]
*  We're not having 16 games on Sunday. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1976.12s)]
*  Two more in January after Christmas that lead up to the quarterfinals. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1978.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1983.12s)]
*  And in terms of fans, like how much would it cost to just, here's 5,000 tickets. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1984.12s)]
*  If your team makes it, we're going to give up. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1989.56s)]
*  You know, we have a 5,000 free tickets. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1991.56s)]
*  Please take the ticket and go. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1994.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, you're not going to pay for people to go, but where you're at least have access [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1995.3999999999999s)]
*  to the arena, it can't be it can't like really be, you know, cost. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=1999.1599999999999s)]
*  Emirates Airlines could fucking get private jets for everybody. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2003.6799999999998s)]
*  They got the big planes. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2007.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2010.6799999999998s)]
*  The PJs for the party. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2011.6799999999998s)]
*  The party plane. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2013.6799999999998s)]
*  OK. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2014.6799999999998s)]
*  The party plane. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2015.6799999999998s)]
*  Did we lay it down this for a fix? [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2016.8s)]
*  Six instead of four target that weekend before the Super Bowl weekend and maybe have the [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2018.92s)]
*  trade deadline right after on like the Tuesday. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2024.92s)]
*  I mean, here's the thing. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2027.68s)]
*  The trade deadline sucks now. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2028.92s)]
*  They ruined it. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2030.3600000000001s)]
*  The collective agreement. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2031.3600000000001s)]
*  They did. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2032.3600000000001s)]
*  They aproned it. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2033.3600000000001s)]
*  There is no trade deadline that's relevant anymore. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2034.3600000000001s)]
*  By the way, again, I feel like I'm always bashing Adam Silver. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2035.3600000000001s)]
*  Like the guy did a good job. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2039.88s)]
*  He went and got to enrich the players and the owners with this new TV deal. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2041.28s)]
*  He did. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2044.92s)]
*  He's an absolute magnet for corporate money. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2046.16s)]
*  Like they invented the NBA Cup the next year. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2048.56s)]
*  They like up. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2051.12s)]
*  We got the Emirates. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2052.12s)]
*  The Emiratis are paying for it. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2053.12s)]
*  Like he is a master at that. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2055.12s)]
*  But this whole thing about we want to be like football and have parity. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2057.8s)]
*  And so let's make it impossible for good teams to stack talent and trades just an impossibility. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2064.7200000000003s)]
*  Now, this was a mistake, guys. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2072.16s)]
*  It was a mistake. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2075.6s)]
*  The Nuggets can't even trade for Jimmy Butler, who would probably be dying to go there. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2076.88s)]
*  And they can't do it with the fucking apron. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2082.36s)]
*  It's like, well, Zeke Nodgy has to be in it. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2084.56s)]
*  And please don't look at Michael Porter's back x-rays. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2086.72s)]
*  And we have no picks. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2090.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's really sad. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2091.64s)]
*  All right, Was. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2093.4s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2094.92s)]
*  Who's winning the title, by the way? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2095.92s)]
*  I picked the Dallas Mavericks before the season. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2100.04s)]
*  I don't know if I've unleashed this take on you. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2103.2s)]
*  I saw the Celtics as the 2016 Warriors coming off a championship, smoking everybody all [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2106.3599999999997s)]
*  regular season, faced the Cavs in the finals the year before, just like the Mavericks. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2114.2s)]
*  I think the Mavericks and the Celtics are going to rematch in the finals. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2119.64s)]
*  And Luka Doncic, like LeBron before him, is going to find a way to win his first NBA championship, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2125.52s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2133.96s)]
*  I love it. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2134.96s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2135.96s)]
*  I think it's a good way to give. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2136.96s)]
*  No, I mean, as a guy who was an early embracer of that Dallas Mavericks, they really changed [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2139.96s)]
*  the entire trajectory of their franchise at the trade deadline last year. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2146.68s)]
*  Speaking of trades not mattering anymore. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2150.52s)]
*  It's Daniel Caffer to PJ Washington. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2152.44s)]
*  And that's a fun and then they did an incredible job in the offseason building up around those [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2155.52s)]
*  guys and getting rid of some pieces that didn't 12 and 2 in the last four. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2159.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2163.92s)]
*  I think, unfortunately for them, I think OKC might be their kryptonite team. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2164.92s)]
*  That's the one team that just too much speed athleticism. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2169.8s)]
*  I guess what they have going for them is just Jalen Williams in any game that means anything. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2172.12s)]
*  Oh, I need to feed the first NBA moment. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2177.12s)]
*  They're going to be in your mentions, Bill. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2179.64s)]
*  Oh, Lord have mercy. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2181.6s)]
*  Just have one awesome game when there's a real spotlight on. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2182.6s)]

*  He's stuck in the second NBA. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2195.28s)]
*  I just I have a lot of Jalen Williams stock. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2196.6s)]
*  I'd like for him to come through. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2199.36s)]
*  I mean, the other reason they lost, they just couldn't get a three, which is now happening [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2201.28s)]
*  in the third league. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2204.4s)]
*  He needs to be all right. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2205.4s)]
*  Yeah, I have OKC Dallas. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2207.4s)]
*  I still feel like I want to see what happens with the Butler trade because he butlers clearly [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2209.6800000000003s)]
*  this is happening soon. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2214.6s)]
*  And if Houston got him without changing too much, what I like about them, I'm intrigued [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2217.04s)]
*  by them, too. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2223.04s)]
*  Can you house? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2224.04s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2225.04s)]
*  E-May and Jimmy Butler, how fucking alpha that team's going to be if they keep doing Brooks? [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2226.04s)]
*  Like that's like they're like a biker gang. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2233.44s)]
*  It's exciting. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2238.68s)]

*  Yes, E-May looked at LeBron and called him a bitch and asked him what he was going to [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2248.3199999999997s)]
*  do. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2252.44s)]
*  That happened last year. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2253.44s)]
*  Put him and Jimmy Butler. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2254.44s)]
*  I just think that's that's happening imminently. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2258.3599999999997s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTWmEGN2kvA&t=2260.9199999999996s)]
