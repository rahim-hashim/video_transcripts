# ESPN Should Bring in LeBron James #shorts #billsimmons #lebronjames #nba #espn
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [January 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7qmyimnkrw)
*  Bill in the car here. I was thinking about what ESPN would do with their number one NBA team now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7qmyimnkrw&t=0.0s)]
*  that Doc Rivers is gone because they have Mike Breen and Doris Burke, neither of whom played or [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7qmyimnkrw&t=5.68s)]
*  coached in the NBA. To my knowledge, that would be the first time anyone has ever tried it out in a [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7qmyimnkrw&t=9.36s)]
*  team in any pro sport in national games for a finals that didn't play or coach. They can't do [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7qmyimnkrw&t=13.76s)]
*  that. They have to get a player or coach. I think they should wait until round three, see who gets [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7qmyimnkrw&t=19.44s)]
*  bounced and then use a current player and put that current player with Doris and with Mike. So who [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7qmyimnkrw&t=23.6s)]
*  should that player be? Well, guess who's not going to make round three? LeBron James. Bring LeBron in. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7qmyimnkrw&t=29.2s)]
*  We'll be trying to decipher all the stuff he says. Oh wait, was that a veiled shot at somebody? He's [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7qmyimnkrw&t=34.48s)]
*  the smartest basketball player we have. Let him teach us about what's happening in these games, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7qmyimnkrw&t=39.44s)]
*  how to attack people. Every day after the games, there would be a story about, oh, LeBron said [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7qmyimnkrw&t=44.0s)]
*  these four things. Oh my God, I can't believe he said that about so-and-so. And if you're LeBron, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7qmyimnkrw&t=48.8s)]
*  you're not going to make the finals this year. What a great way to stay in the limelight. ESPN, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7qmyimnkrw&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  call LeBron. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7qmyimnkrw&t=56.8s)]
