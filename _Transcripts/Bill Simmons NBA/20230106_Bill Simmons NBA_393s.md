# Does Kawhi Have the Strangest Career of All Great Players? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [January 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tDsPfvxLsY)
*  circling back to the Quippers for a second.
*  Should that team be in the mix?
*  And not just because of the continuity stuff of not being able to get these guys
*  playing all the time, but just like, is this working?
*  You know, like I think they have too many guys, my too many guys theory,
*  which Darrell Moore scolded me on when you're Houston.
*  I was just like, you have too many guys.
*  He's like, that's ridiculous.
*  It's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
*  How can you have too many guys?
*  It's like, well, there's 240 minutes in an NBA game and you can only play five
*  people at a time.
*  And if you have 11 guys who love to play, not awesome.
*  And I do feel that with the Quippers that they don't seem like a happy team
*  watching them lately.
*  And then on top of it with, you don't know where Kawhi or Paul are coming from.
*  Um, I also don't love their guards.
*  And I think guards are the most important they've ever been with the way, the
*  style of the game and the way the leagues have gone.
*  And I would say they're below average on the guard standpoint.
*  What else do you like or what else do you not like about this Quipper team?
*  I mean, they're confounding.
*  And some of it is what you're talking about.
*  Like on paper, they do have too many guys and you could see that from the preseason
*  perspective, you know, I wrote about this for the ringer, about like having the
*  ability to feel through the season and figure out which guys fit and which ones
*  don't, you can make trades, you can consolidate, there should be lots of
*  options available to you.
*  And yet I don't feel like we've really had like a very clear answer of like who
*  their preferred players are.
*  You know, there's, there's been stints when like, you know, Robert Covington,
*  who could be an important part of this team is just like totally out of the
*  rotation entirely.
*  Obviously they've had to do like all kinds of things just to accommodate not
*  having Kawhi or not having Paul George and getting given point in time.
*  We're not having John Wall at any given point in time.
*  He's been managed a lot this season too, in terms of his, his health situation.
*  So it's really hard to get a feel for that.
*  I think what makes me pause about the too many guys thing being a problem
*  necessarily is that by and large, their defense has been good.
*  And that's where I would expect if there were a too many guys problem, it would be
*  guys like, yes, they might hunt shots.
*  Yes, there may be offensive problems, but like defensively, if the attitudes are
*  bad, that's going to show in the bottom line.
*  Like they're not going to guard if they're not bought in on the idea.
*  And the fact that they're still pretty solvent offensively gives me some hope
*  that there's at least a level of buy in there and a level of like, okay, we have
*  the pieces we need, we just need to figure it out.
*  That said, there's a lot to figure out.
*  There's just so much more that the Clippers have to sort out between now and
*  the start of the playoffs than any other team in the league.
*  And they're not giving us much reason beyond just like the talent on paper to
*  be confident in that theory at all.
*  Did you see this Kawhi?
*  They ran this Kawhi stat today that he has a 743 winning percentage.
*  Overall in the regular season.
*  And then the playoffs, that's like 80.
*  What, but I was, I had a, I, I locked this away a while ago because I was always
*  fascinated by the winning percentage stat and I never understood why it wasn't a
*  bigger deal regular season and playoffs combined.
*  There's only four guys ever.
*  And I don't know if Kawhi qualifies for this because I haven't seen the combo
*  stats, there's only four guys ever who are 700 and higher magic Johnson, Bill
*  Russell, Tim Duncan, and Larry Bird.
*  Wow.
*  And magic was the highest at seven 28.
*  That's regular season and playoffs combined.
*  So I think Kawhi is close, but it did make me think like, I think it's the
*  strangest career of all the great players, right?
*  He was the best guy in 2019 for our title team.
*  He was also a finals MVP in a series that had LeBron and the other team.
*  Every year his teams have been good, but yet he's missed like crazy amounts of
*  time too.
*  It's almost like the, it's like the parallel would be Bill Walton if Bill
*  Walton played more 45 years ago, but there's really nobody like him.
*  I think he's going to retire and we're going to have a lot of trouble putting
*  their career into perspective.
*  It's like, was he, he kind of was as good as like he was on that LeBron level for
*  a couple of years, but he couldn't sustain really any of it.
*  But yet I still feel like maybe he's on that level.
*  I don't know.
*  I he's the most confounding guy in the league to me right now.
*  He's going to be the ultimate, like, do you value peak or longevity guy?
*  Right?
*  Like if you purely value who was this guy at his absolute best, he could probably
*  go toe to toe with a lot of the greatest players in history.
*  Right.
*  Ceiling wise.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Ceiling wise.
*  It's just, and we may need a third categorization for him because it's not
*  even like peak and longevity.
*  There's just like an availability question where you almost can't compare his win
*  percentage stats to those guys just by the sheer number of the games played, the
*  sheer consistency of those games played.
*  And more importantly, what those games mean, you know, if you are a, an every
*  night superstar presence and your team is winning 70 plus percent of its games,
*  that is a franchise altering development and quite Leonard can still be a
*  franchise altering player.
*  He wasn't that for the first four years in San Antonio that it didn't really
*  happen until 2016.
*  No.
*  And I mean, that's, that's a whole, a whole nother way in which Kawhi is a
*  phenomenally weird player to consider is you still hear a lot of noise about his
*  exit out of San Antonio and what happened.
*  And he's one of the only players, at least in that superstar position to be a
*  finals MVP and then just walk away from a championship winning team in the
*  fashion needed in Toronto.
*  Just an incredibly strange case in almost every historical respect.
*  And then you have some pretty crazy what ifs with him too.
*  Right.
*  It's like, what if he doesn't get hurt in 2017?
*  Could they really gotten toe to toe with them?
*  What if, um, San Antonio doesn't trade him to Toronto and he goes in the other
*  direction, what if the, what if the Celtics said, fuck it, we'll trade Jaylin
*  Brown for a year of Kawhi.
*  We'll see what happens.
*  What if he was a career, what if he was a career Indiana Pacer and never made it
*  to San Antonio in the first place?
*  The George Hill trade.
*  That was a good one.
*  Then the, then the Lakers one is the other one where it looked like it was going to
*  be him and LeBron together and maybe they go get Davis in a year and instead, um,
*  that's not how it plays out.
*  Wait, what, what was the chronology of that?
*  Yeah.
*  Kawhi didn't work out.
*  So then they traded for Davis.
*  That sounds right.
*  Yeah.
*  But maybe they could have traded for Davis anyway.
*  So you have that.
*  And then with this Cooper's thing, you have that one year where it really seemed
*  like they were probably going to win the finals.
*  They would seem like the safest bet in 21.
*  That was when he goes down and we ended up with Buck sons.
*  And then we ended up with that fourth.
