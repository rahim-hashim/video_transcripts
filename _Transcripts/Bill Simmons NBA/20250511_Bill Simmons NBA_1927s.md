# Making Sense of a Shocking Cavaliers/Pacers Series | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=0.0s)]
*  Taping this top part of the podcast here, it is seven 30 Pacific time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=0.5s)]
*  We're doing that during the Cavs Pacers game because that game ended about an hour ago, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=4.5s)]
*  even though they're still playing it right now. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=8.4s)]
*  And James Johnson just came in, uh, the Pacers 25 assists in the first half, which is a number [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=9.76s)]
*  I did not know was attainable. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=14.76s)]
*  And they absolutely ran Cleveland off the floor. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=16.64s)]
*  And just when you thought it couldn't get worse, the third quarter started and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=18.88s)]
*  Donovan Mitchell was nowhere to be seen because he apparently hurt his ankle. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  And the Cavs are now down three to one heading back to Cleveland for game five. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=26.16s)]
*  And the Pacers have completely thoroughly, totally, and unequivocally, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=30.64s)]
*  I'll play them and have momentum. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=34.56s)]
*  And this is now looking really dangerous, not just for this season, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=37.08s)]
*  Rossello for the Cavaliers, but big picture. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  If you get wiped out like this by the Pacers, I'm not sure what you do [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=45.6s)]
*  heading into the summer. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  And I'm not even sure what the fixes are. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=50.68s)]
*  And maybe you look at it and you take a breath. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=55.6s)]
*  And you go, all right, just wasn't our round. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=60.0s)]
*  I guess let's run it back. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=62.56s)]
*  We, we won 64 games. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=64.08s)]
*  I find it hard to believe that's how it would play out because this is really [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=67.4s)]
*  bad how this is played out. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=70.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  The assist number at one point, it was, um, 20 to two in team assists. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=73.16s)]
*  And, you know, they're just flying around. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=78.88s)]
*  I mean, this game is like overwhelming. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=81.0s)]
*  Um, I'm, I'm still a little in shock. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=83.08s)]
*  Now look, uh, two things here. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=85.88s)]
*  If Cleveland goes 82 and O and they lose this series, they go 82 and O next year. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=87.72s)]
*  No one's going to care. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=91.48s)]
*  Um, because people are going to say there's this fundamental flaw with this team. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=92.96s)]
*  If you're Cleveland, you're going to probably run it back and you'll start to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=96.0s)]
*  make excuses, which I think are worth bringing up your game to we're missing [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=99.92s)]
*  Garland, we're missing Mobley, we're missing Hunter, and you still, if you [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=104.52s)]
*  inbound the basketball, you could win that game. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=109.12s)]
*  Mitchell leaves. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  They were, they weren't coming back in this game, even with Mitchell being out. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=113.2s)]
*  And you know, like, Hey, Garland was never really right. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=117.36s)]
*  Now I know, like I'm not sitting here suggesting that's the only reason you're [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=119.16000000000001s)]
*  here, but that's probably what they would do. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=123.44000000000001s)]
*  Wouldn't they? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=126.52000000000001s)]
*  I think you're right. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=128.32s)]
*  But I'm also stunned that it was this much of an ass kicking today because [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=130.16s)]
*  usually game four is the, like what we watched and we're going to talk about [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=134.24s)]
*  later in the podcast, that OKC Denver game, where both teams kind of realize [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  the stakes in the moment and what needs to happen. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=142.24s)]
*  There's a level of intensity and there's a caring that usually exists in a game [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=146.64s)]
*  like this and from Cleveland, from the get-go, you didn't see it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=152.12s)]
*  They weren't rotating on defense. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=154.4s)]
*  They were just getting sliced and diced on that three, two zone. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=156.64s)]
*  Um, I think the thing that really stands out to me beyond just the talent and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=160.48s)]
*  whether this might not be a great matchup for Cleveland, Indies feisty. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=164.56s)]
*  They play with a real chip on their shoulder. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=169.96s)]
*  They've done that all year. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=171.8s)]
*  They love playing really good teams or teams with great players like they, with [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=172.72s)]
*  the Lakers, the Celtics, like whoever it is, they really come out with their [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=176.92s)]
*  chest puffed out, they try to start shit, they're agitators, they have a real [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=180.96s)]
*  personality to them and, um, they kind of know who they are. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=185.04s)]
*  They have a real identity. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=189.32s)]
*  And for whatever reason, Cleveland feels like it's losing its identity [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=191.76s)]
*  as these playoffs go along. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=195.16s)]
*  It's like, what is this team? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=196.56s)]
*  Alan had a 19 and 12 in game three and in game four, he got buried in the first [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  half as that one sideways. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=202.36s)]
*  Um, but they, they have the, uh, the Garland piece, which I know he's been hurt. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=204.4s)]
*  And he, you know, I know his stats are okay today, but he looks. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=210.76000000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  Not great, but you would think like they're equipped to, to fill in if he's [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  hurt or playing 80% because of how deep their bench is and then the bench didn't [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=220.88000000000002s)]
*  show up and then Mitchell basically was superhuman in game two and three. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=225.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=229.32000000000002s)]
*  He did so much like his body ended up breaking down from it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=229.72s)]
*  It just feels like if these teams played 20 times, I'm not sure how it would go [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=234.16s)]
*  for, for Cleveland, so I can't decide if this is a bad matchup, could this have [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=237.92s)]
*  happened if they played Milwaukee? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=242.64s)]
*  Like what big picture, what does this mean? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=244.04s)]
*  Was this like a, like a mid 2010s Atlanta Hawks type team? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=246.27999999999997s)]
*  Is there a road back for them? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=250.16s)]
*  I'm just, I'm swimming with questions and I have no answers. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=251.67999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, there's a tweet. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  I think it's right. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=257.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=258.0s)]
*  Then double check it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  But if you look at where Cleveland was this season, right? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=260.28s)]
*  So 14 teams in NBA history that won at least 64 games and posted a barge of [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=265.2s)]
*  victory of nine or points, nine points or better 13 reached the NBA finals. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=269.8s)]
*  Um, the only team that didn't was the 15, 16 San Antonio Spurs, right? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=275.44s)]
*  Zaza, Kawai. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=280.8s)]
*  So that year, the, wasn't that the year after 17? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=283.24s)]
*  That was the Rance first warriors year, right? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=286.56s)]
*  That 16 team, that was that weird NBA season where there weren't a [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=288.84s)]
*  lot of good teams that year. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=292.44s)]
*  Remember? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=294.52s)]
*  And they did, they did well, but it was, you know, we, we weren't ever really, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=295.11999999999995s)]
*  so it was always the warriors year. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=299.79999999999995s)]
*  It always seems like it was going to be the warriors and the Cavs. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=301.11999999999995s)]
*  It was 17. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=303.47999999999996s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=304.28s)]
*  Um, look, I mean, this is, this is pretty ridiculous that you would be this good. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=305.44s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, like, is it, is it just a bad matchup part of it? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=310.91999999999996s)]
*  You know, the crazy thing about Cleveland, like going into the year, it was, how are [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=314.32s)]
*  you going to figure out a way to win in the playoffs with the Alan Mobley piece [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=317.76s)]
*  of it? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=321.28s)]
*  Well, Mobley got better. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=321.52s)]
*  Atkinson staggered them. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  You know, I always think about that Cleveland comeback against Boston and [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=325.48s)]
*  Boston, where they closed with Hunter and Mobley and took Alan off the floor. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=328.03999999999996s)]
*  Cause they didn't like the way Tatum was getting out of it switches. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=331.28s)]
*  So I was like, Oh, cause this is something that we'll see in the play. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=333.4s)]
*  Like all of these basketball things that you would think that are part of the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=335.76s)]
*  conversation, you know, it doesn't really apply to, you're sitting there looking [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=338.88s)]
*  at, Hey, are they ignoring, ignoring any of these guys in the space? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=342.76s)]
*  It's like, no, Indiana is actually getting anything they want. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=346.0s)]
*  I think the most impressive thing from this game, which is also part of what I [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=348.04s)]
*  think is absolutely correct is that the Pacers have this real edge to them is [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=353.04s)]
*  whatever they did from game three to game four in preparation of this three, two [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=356.84000000000003s)]
*  zone that Cleveland runs, they figured it out and the coaching staff prepped [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  these guys great. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=364.24s)]
*  The execution of it was terrific. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=364.96000000000004s)]
*  And you could see that Cleveland was scrambling because, you know, really [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=366.32s)]
*  the zone stuff that we're seeing constantly throughout these playoff [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=369.48s)]
*  games, everybody knows this. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=371.88s)]
*  You just got to figure out a way to get it to collapse. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=373.96000000000004s)]
*  You got to get away to attack the middle and then you can attack off of that [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=376.2s)]
*  because you're trying to keep the ball out of the middle. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=380.52000000000004s)]
*  They ran a roller, go down the middle and then either he goes to the rim or he [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=382.36s)]
*  kicks it back out and they were doing it perfectly today. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=386.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=389.0s)]
*  They had a pick and roll with Toppin at the free throw line. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=389.20000000000005s)]
*  He rolls and then guess who he's finishing against. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=391.96000000000004s)]
*  Cause Mowgli was at the top. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=393.92s)]
*  Like when this thing was working in game three, you're going, my God, Mowgli is [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=395.24s)]
*  chasing everybody around and contesting and trapping and screwing up the first [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=399.04s)]
*  thing that you want to do. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=403.0s)]
*  You have the luxury of having Evan Mowgli at the top of a two, three zone, or [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=403.92s)]
*  excuse me, a three, two zone because Allen can play underneath them. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=407.72s)]
*  Well, in these minutes where Toppin was destroying them in the first half, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=410.76s)]
*  Allen was out. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=414.36s)]
*  So then they switched it to Mowgli underneath. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=415.56s)]
*  Then the Pacers got another good look and then they brought him back. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=417.68s)]
*  And then they went to man and then Turner hit a three. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=420.76s)]
*  And then there was another play where they were like, okay, I think we have this. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=423.12s)]
*  Again, they're, they're down so big. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=426.8s)]
*  You can't say, Hey, now we're settled on defense. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=428.4s)]
*  We know what we're going to do. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=430.4s)]
*  And then Nie Smith hits an end of a shot clock. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=431.08s)]
*  So like everything that possibly could have worked out, I think started with them [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=432.8s)]
*  having a much better plan and being way more comfortable with a three, two that [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=437.64s)]
*  even TJ McConnell admitted, and I screwed us up a little bit there in game three. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=441.28000000000003s)]
*  So Cleveland thinks they have this answer. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=445.6s)]
*  They have this defensive thing that they can do, especially when it's those two [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=447.48s)]
*  guys, and yet they got destroyed in a bunch of different versions of it tonight. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=450.84000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=455.12s)]
*  And the Pacers, I say this as the highest compliment I can give, because I [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=455.96000000000004s)]
*  really love this team, but they were, they look a little 2014 Spurs ish at times [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=460.20000000000005s)]
*  with the way they play with each other and the ball moves around with the added bonus [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=465.08000000000004s)]
*  that I think they're a really good transition team and how Burton, you know, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=469.20000000000005s)]
*  especially in a game like today, when there was one pass he threw, he's at mid [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=473.88000000000005s)]
*  court and he just threw this lob pass in the corner, almost like watching a [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=477.76000000000005s)]
*  quarterback throw a lead pass to receiver down the sidelines, just casually threw it. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=482.40000000000003s)]
*  And he had a guy running down and caught it like in stride stopped and had a look. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=489.20000000000005s)]
*  And I was like, this team sees angles that I don't normally see when I'm watching [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=493.16s)]
*  basketball, they really have fun playing with each other. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=497.72s)]
*  They have all these guards, they pressure full court. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=500.84000000000003s)]
*  I think they're a huge pain in the ass to play. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=503.76000000000005s)]
*  I think you want to punch them in the face after like game two, which we saw today. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=505.68s)]
*  Mather and you know, go to Hunter into a thing and then thinks he's the smart guy. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=509.84000000000003s)]
*  And then they review it and they're like, no, actually you're getting tossed. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=514.28s)]
*  But, uh, they just want to get under your skin. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=517.72s)]
*  And I think they're annoying to play. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=521.4s)]
*  I, I, it's no surprise to Celtics fans because this is a team that has come. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=522.92s)]
*  Every time they played the Celtics, they brought it. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=528.4s)]
*  Um, they start shit. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=531.04s)]
*  They're really hard to play. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=532.84s)]
*  They have a deep bench. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=534.08s)]
*  They're really good at home. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=535.2s)]
*  They get a good crowd. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=536.76s)]
*  And, uh, I think they're for real. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=538.24s)]
*  I've thought they were for real all year. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=539.84s)]
*  With that said, I'm shocked that Cleveland could look this bad in an important game. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=541.36s)]
*  And I don't know whether Mitchell, it took so much for him those first couple [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=546.6s)]
*  days with, you know, such a burden. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=550.2s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=552.6800000000001s)]
*  I just think basketball is really hard now in 2025. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=553.9200000000001s)]
*  You know, it's, it's when you have those games like that game that he had when [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=558.16s)]
*  he was literally dead at the end of the game and you're doing everything, all [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=562.6800000000001s)]
*  the running and all the contact and the amount of times he was bouncing against [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=567.32s)]
*  people and finishing and I don't know. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=570.8000000000001s)]
*  I hate to shit on the old generations because, you know, I love all that [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=574.16s)]
*  basketball, but I just think it's harder. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=578.4399999999999s)]
*  I think these games are harder. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=580.5999999999999s)]
*  I think they're more physical. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=581.8399999999999s)]
*  They're more taxing and it's a lot to ask from these dudes to put an [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=582.8399999999999s)]
*  offense on your back like that. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=587.16s)]
*  You know? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=588.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=589.5999999999999s)]
*  I mean, that might be, I mean, I'm open for anything, but to come out that flat [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=589.8399999999999s)]
*  and to let it get away from you that much. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=593.12s)]
*  And you know, you still felt like the frontline depth Cleveland versus Indiana. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=595.36s)]
*  Like at what point would you have gone? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=600.0s)]
*  You know, I think miles Turner is going to be able to hold up here. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=603.1600000000001s)]
*  I mean, every backup center minute for the Pacers this year, cause they [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=605.24s)]
*  lost so many guys injuries. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=607.88s)]
*  You're thinking like, how are they going to ride this out with Turner? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=609.6400000000001s)]
*  Cause it still felt like Turner was somebody that you could attack. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=612.12s)]
*  Um, granted the shooting that he gives you in the spacing opens up a lot of [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=615.2800000000001s)]
*  the stuff that you're talking about and how they're able to attack, but it's [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=618.36s)]
*  just crazy to see 48 hours later, this look like a completely different series, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=620.8000000000001s)]
*  especially when, you know, the Cavs should be able to win a game on the road, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=625.6400000000001s)]
*  which we saw, um, they've got to be kicking their ass. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=628.6800000000001s)]
*  Still from game two for allowing that to happen. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=632.0799999999999s)]
*  So there's part of me that still thinks like, man, if they just inbounded, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=634.5999999999999s)]
*  okay, then today happens and then it's two, two. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=637.16s)]
*  So, so where are we going with all this stuff? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=639.7199999999999s)]
*  But I mean, Cleveland, if they don't win this series, which it doesn't look [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=642.0799999999999s)]
*  like it's going to happen down three, one now they are going to be like [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=644.3599999999999s)]
*  completely written off. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=648.04s)]
*  And if they run the same group back, which is usually the default of what a GM [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=649.4399999999999s)]
*  would do, be like, Hey, we're really good. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=652.4s)]
*  This is what we did to the regular season. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=653.4399999999999s)]
*  We had our hiccups that we mentioned at the top, which I'm sure they would say [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=654.8399999999999s)]
*  internally with each other, but this was just alarming to start a game that [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=657.76s)]
*  matters this mo matters this much. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=662.52s)]
*  And just note like, Hey, it's 20. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=665.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=667.92s)]
*  Well now it's 30 and then it's 40. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=668.24s)]
*  It just was an ass kicking. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=670.52s)]
*  Um, and I'm, I'm still kind of shocked. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=673.72s)]
*  Me too. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=677.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, then if you're the Celtics, you win this game and Saturday, you have this [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=678.12s)]
*  Knicks game on Monday. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=683.4399999999999s)]
*  That's I think one of the biggest Knicks games of the century, but now you're [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=684.52s)]
*  looking at, Hey, if we can just, we've outplayed the Knicks for 93% of this [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=689.1999999999999s)]
*  series, let's take care of business. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=695.48s)]
*  When three more, we're going to have home court for round three, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=697.24s)]
*  potentially with Indiana. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=699.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=701.6s)]
*  So it goes from, let's say, let's even say it goes to seven and they're able [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=702.16s)]
*  to hold on and beat the Knicks in seven and game one of the next series. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=705.64s)]
*  He's in Boston on a Wednesday. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=710.72s)]
*  You know, and you get the game seven potentially at home too. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=713.28s)]
*  It's an amazing turn of events when you consider a team won 64 games in the [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=715.48s)]
*  conference and you know, I, I really believed in Cleveland. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=721.24s)]
*  I thought this was going to be really hard series because I'm also, as we [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=725.84s)]
*  talked about many times, I just really thought Indiana was good, but I really [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=729.2s)]
*  was sold on Cleveland as a team. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=732.84s)]
*  I thought they had a bench. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=734.8000000000001s)]
*  I believed in Mitchell as a, as a guy who'd be the number one guy in a [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=736.36s)]
*  potential finals team thought they were there defensively, but the signs that [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=740.04s)]
*  were there, if you're really looking back, we talked about it some with the net [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=744.76s)]
*  rating for the last 25 games, last 30 games, and they just were better the [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=747.8s)]
*  first 30, 35 games than they were the rest of the year. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=752.76s)]
*  And the defensive stuff was the stuff that I think there was some subtle red [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=755.52s)]
*  flags, they just weren't a top five or six defense anymore, really from the [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=759.8s)]
*  all-star break on. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=764.44s)]
*  And the question was why, what was happening? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=766.08s)]
*  And then you see like today, you know, there he's, when did he put a court? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=769.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=773.8s)]
*  Cora was in there a bunch, but he's, I almost felt like Atkinson was grasping [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=774.0s)]
*  for straws a little bit in this game. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=778.6s)]
*  Like he's just trying lineups and players. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=780.16s)]
*  I'm saying the first half, like, uh, I hope a coral has something. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=782.8s)]
*  It's like, wow, you guys are at that stage. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=786.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=789.52s)]
*  I hope I can give us an offensive boost stage of the season. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=789.76s)]
*  When a coral got in there, it felt like it was, it was kind of already over, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=794.4s)]
*  but yeah, they were down 30. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=797.6800000000001s)]
*  Ty Jerome comes in and you're hoping like he can kind of be tired. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=799.28s)]
*  He's been, he's been awesome. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=804.5600000000001s)]
*  And even in the game where he had a lot of, a lot of points and he took 20 shots, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=807.28s)]
*  you're like, man, a playoff game with Ty Jerome taking 20 shots. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=811.24s)]
*  Like we like them, but I don't know if I like them that much. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=813.5600000000001s)]
*  And you would have thought like, can he at least, you know, not to be TJ McConnell, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=816.04s)]
*  but can he be somebody who gets you into some really good stuff as you're trying [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=821.12s)]
*  to figure out the Garland situation with him being out? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=825.32s)]
*  And then that turns into a disaster. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=828.4s)]
*  Hunter today, five points, five fouls. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=830.0s)]
*  So that acquisition hasn't paid the dividends that you'd expect it to have. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=832.6s)]
*  The rebounding numbers, like granted Indiana didn't miss. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=836.36s)]
*  So there weren't a ton of potential rebounds, but 47 combined minutes when I [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=839.64s)]
*  wrote it down, when it was like 98, 64, those guys combined had seven rebounds. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=843.24s)]
*  Again, it's also speaks to how well the Pacers were shooting the ball. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=847.52s)]
*  But I'm going to ask you this because as much as we're talking about the Pacers, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=851.0799999999999s)]
*  hey, they're a feisty team. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=857.04s)]
*  They're going to be a tough out defensively. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=858.0s)]
*  You're right. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=860.32s)]
*  Like you start looking at the defensive rating as teams are closing the season [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=860.8s)]
*  after the All-Star break, the Pacers were eighth, you know, it's a team that went 20 [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=863.88s)]
*  and nine, some of the Cleveland slip off. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=867.48s)]
*  I think at the time we were like, all right, is that real? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=869.88s)]
*  Or is this a team that's just been cruising to the one seed the entire time? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=872.36s)]
*  The one seed locked. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=875.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=876.44s)]
*  So, I mean, there's, there's ways you can look at that saying, Hey, the Pacers [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=876.72s)]
*  number feels more real because they're closing and they're kind of fighting for [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=879.88s)]
*  everything and the, and the Cavs and the other side of it, like whatever. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=882.48s)]
*  But let's just say the Pacers get through the East. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=886.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=891.0s)]
*  I mean, have you ever thought of Halliburton as a top 10 player in the NBA? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=892.28s)]
*  I don't know if I still would, even if they got to the finals. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=896.9200000000001s)]
*  So it's kind of, Hey, whenever I looked at the Pacers, I'm like, man, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=900.64s)]
*  there's a lot of stuff to like. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=904.64s)]
*  I don't know if they're really going to go with this rotation. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=905.9200000000001s)]
*  Are they really going to play this many guys? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=907.72s)]
*  And the answer is yes. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=909.1600000000001s)]
*  Um, the defensive part of it has been real in the way that they've closed [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=910.84s)]
*  because last year I just thought they were complete, like, all right, whatever. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=914.6s)]
*  Like cool that you're in the Easter conference finals, but I mean, I've [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=917.28s)]
*  done really take you seriously defensively. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=919.72s)]
*  They got some luck. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=921.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=922.6s)]
*  Um, this would be unlike the blueprint that we have all the things that you [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=923.0400000000001s)]
*  think are real in the NBA. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=930.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=932.64s)]
*  He go, all right, well, who's your best guy? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=933.52s)]
*  And like, who's your second best guy? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=935.24s)]
*  The Pacers, even the biggest Halliburton fan, like don't check that box. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=937.5600000000001s)]
*  And I think that's. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=943.1600000000001s)]
*  But that's why the comparison is back to, but that's why the 2014 spurs. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=944.44s)]
*  That's what made me think of. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=949.36s)]
*  That's what this feels like a little bit. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=951.4000000000001s)]
*  If that's how it played out, because remember Duncan's at slightly different [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=953.0400000000001s)]
*  stage of his, his, uh, he's at the tail tail end of a really great career as [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=957.72s)]
*  like a guy who could be a 35 minute a game guy for somebody, Kauai wasn't Kauai [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=962.5600000000001s)]
*  yet, then Parker was probably the most talented guy in the team in terms of [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=967.08s)]
*  where he was in his career. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=971.44s)]
*  Diao's there. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=973.48s)]
*  Janobie's older, you know, but the team made sense when you saw everybody together. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=974.8000000000001s)]
*  And I think Indiana has a little of that. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=979.8000000000001s)]
*  The team kind of makes sense when you watch them. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=981.6800000000001s)]
*  And I do think they have, even though they're not a traditional, awesome [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=983.96s)]
*  defense, they do like these bits are really good defender. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=987.5600000000001s)]
*  Like if, if you're just throwing him on whoever the best perimeter guy is on [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=990.72s)]
*  another team, you can feel pretty good about that, you know, um, they hit threes [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=994.6s)]
*  and they're deep and they really like to play with each other and they really, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1000.1999999999999s)]
*  I feel like have an identity, which is all I'm looking for when we get to mid [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1006.76s)]
*  bay, do you have an identity? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1010.16s)]
*  And that's what's weird about Cleveland is what's your identity now? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1011.48s)]
*  Cause you're not great on defense. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1015.16s)]
*  You're very Mitchell heavy. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1017.68s)]
*  I'm not positive who your best five guys are. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1021.0s)]
*  Yeah, but we know who their best four guys are. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1025.4s)]
*  That was the whole point of this team is we know who they're [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1027.2s)]
*  Who's the fifth guy though. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1029.28s)]
*  It's a kind of a big thing. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1031.36s)]
*  Cause you have two bigs and two smalls and then it's like a danger hunter. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1032.2s)]
*  I don't know that I'm ready to audit the calves and that those four guys [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1036.8s)]
*  just aren't that good now. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1039.68s)]
*  I mean, who cares who their fifth is when those are your four. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1040.96s)]
*  What does it say? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1043.84s)]
*  And they weren't good. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1044.36s)]
*  I just don't care who their, I just don't care who their fifth guy is when [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1047.8799999999999s)]
*  it's, when it's that good of a four, or at least it's supposed to be that good [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1051.6s)]
*  of a four, I think you're right about the Mitchell part of it where [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1055.44s)]
*  Do you love the Allen part? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1058.52s)]
*  I mean, he sucks now. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1063.04s)]
*  How long is the list? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1064.52s)]
*  Do you love him though? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1067.72s)]
*  I think every team would like Jared Allen. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1069.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1071.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1073.72s)]
*  I watched them toe to toe against Indiana and I just, it's not like I'm like, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1074.24s)]
*  Whoa, there's so much talent. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1077.72s)]
*  It's not like the Celtics Knicks series where you're like, what's going on? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1078.8s)]
*  The Celtics have a better team than the Knicks. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1082.28s)]
*  How is this happening? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1084.04s)]
*  I don't know if I feel that way when I'm watching Cavs Pacers. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1085.68s)]
*  I don't know how you could feel any other way after what we just sat over two [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1088.64s)]
*  hours, so, you know, I didn't expect you to start sitting here and be like, you [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1091.92s)]
*  know, who's awesome is Jared Allen. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1094.96s)]
*  I just think that there was like 82 regular season games where this team [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1096.44s)]
*  was historically really good now. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1100.44s)]
*  And maybe that's another part of this conversation. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1101.8000000000002s)]
*  Home road. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1103.8400000000001s)]
*  Do we care? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1104.6000000000001s)]
*  Doesn't matter anymore. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1105.5600000000002s)]
*  20 point leads. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1106.6000000000001s)]
*  Do we care about regular season at all? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1107.0800000000002s)]
*  Don't matter anymore. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1108.76s)]
*  Um, your net rating doesn't matter anymore. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1110.1200000000001s)]
*  Like all of these things now, like, are we just going to decide that the [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1112.96s)]
*  things we've always believed in? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1118.0s)]
*  None of it matters. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1120.8s)]
*  Cause I mean, Cleveland is checking a lot of boxes being down three one here. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1121.8s)]
*  It's the part that doesn't make sense to me. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1128.32s)]
*  It was why I liked them as a possible finals team because I felt like they had [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1130.28s)]
*  all the things I was looking for except for I wasn't positive who the fifth guy [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1133.96s)]
*  is, but I like strews. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1137.72s)]
*  It's like, all right, if he's your fifth guy, but at least you had a [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1139.32s)]
*  to make some big shots in the corner. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1142.0s)]
*  I feel like he could maybe do that. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1143.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1145.1200000000001s)]
*  There was three guys though. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1146.3200000000002s)]
*  You could throw into that conversation of like, who would be now granted, you [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1147.5600000000002s)]
*  probably wouldn't play Jerome with Garland and Mitchell, but, um, you know, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1150.16s)]
*  Merrill's played a lot. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1154.2s)]
*  Hunter is supposed to be better than this. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1156.2s)]
*  You know, even Dean Wade who gets attacked offensively all the time. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1158.64s)]
*  Cause it's like, Oh, I got him. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1161.3200000000002s)]
*  And then he holds up really well. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1162.68s)]
*  Um, there's, there's a lot of little pieces there that even if you're saying [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1164.88s)]
*  like, Hey, I don't know who the fifth guy is. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1168.44s)]
*  A lot of teams would take all of those options, but this is. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1171.56s)]
*  Look, go ahead. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1174.68s)]
*  It's Prichard and then who are my other four? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1177.3600000000001s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1183.48s)]
*  Oh, just trying to figure out my five. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1184.8s)]
*  I start with Prichard. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1187.3200000000002s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1189.1200000000001s)]
*  Probably Tatum second. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1189.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1191.0800000000002s)]
*  Are you sure? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1192.0800000000002s)]
*  Are you ready for Prichard versus TJ McConnell in the SPN commercial? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1192.64s)]
*  Is 30 shots for Prichard in a playoff game. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1196.8400000000001s)]
*  Look, man, that's like one, two every three minutes. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1201.88s)]
*  I just can't believe they would come out that bad. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1205.4s)]
*  Like normally, even if you're going to lose this game, like get it to 12, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1209.0s)]
*  get it to 12 a little later. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1213.96s)]
*  You know, that's usually how these games work. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1215.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1218.48s)]
*  Well, I think that's the thing. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1219.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1221.3600000000001s)]
*  Well, all right. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1222.28s)]
*  So like you mentioned, I think later in the pod, you mentioned the [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1224.1200000000001s)]
*  64 win sons team that just got waxed. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1227.32s)]
*  We had those Hawks teams in the mid 2010s. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1231.76s)]
*  Like we've seen successful teams crater at the wrong time in the playoffs. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1234.44s)]
*  And every time it's confusing. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1240.52s)]
*  The bigger question to me is after it happens, is there a road back? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1241.96s)]
*  Because the only time I could think of a road back where the road actually came [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1245.88s)]
*  back was that spurs, the Ray Allen shot, and then they came back and they. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1251.0s)]
*  Even think like, oh man, that's it. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1256.0s)]
*  They're never coming back from that. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1257.64s)]
*  Then they came back the next year, the Celtics in 20, uh, three Miami losing [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1258.92s)]
*  the first three where it's like, that's it, blow this thing up. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1267.2s)]
*  This is a wrap. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1269.8s)]
*  Then they came back and they won the next three. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1270.64s)]
*  It's like, all right, what is up? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1272.48s)]
*  Tatum got her in game. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1273.6000000000001s)]
*  Seven. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1274.6s)]
*  Maybe we just need to trademark a smart and grant Williams and, you [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1275.08s)]
*  know, fix around the edges. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1278.28s)]
*  Um, but normally when it goes bad like this and you really take a shit in a [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1280.84s)]
*  series, it usually doesn't come back. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1285.04s)]
*  Like that's usually we look back and be like, ah, when they start making [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1290.04s)]
*  like a big trade two years later, we're like, ah, we should have known. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1294.48s)]
*  Cause that series in 25, when that Pacers game, like we should have known [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1297.12s)]
*  that was when we knew that that nuclear bomb was coming. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1301.4399999999998s)]
*  That was when we knew that that nucleus wasn't going to work. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1304.0s)]
*  Do you see how it goes? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1307.96s)]
*  Uh, a couple of things. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1309.4s)]
*  One that Hawks team that won 60 games in 14 and 15 artificially inflated 60. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1310.72s)]
*  I just don't think they were that good. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1320.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1322.44s)]
*  Well, they were compared to when you look at the net rating points per [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1322.8s)]
*  possession, all that shit, they were not at the level of what this calf's team was. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1327.28s)]
*  But, you know, they didn't even like 64 games. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1331.32s)]
*  Years that was 62. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1333.96s)]
*  Uh, I think it's just 60 that one year where they made it to the Easter [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1335.92s)]
*  conference finals and they got swept. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1339.1200000000001s)]
*  But dude, I said, I've been part documentary about them. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1341.92s)]
*  I got to figure it out. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1344.08s)]
*  No, that's going to be exciting. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1345.2s)]
*  Let me know when you want to do the Kevin Willis. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1347.3600000000001s)]
*  We got a lot. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1350.16s)]
*  We got a lock down on Joe Johnson. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1350.8400000000001s)]
*  Still trying to get an interview with him. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1352.8400000000001s)]
*  So, you know, when that Hawks team comes up short, you're [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1354.4s)]
*  also going up against LeBron. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1356.92s)]
*  Yep. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1358.8s)]
*  So. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1360.8400000000001s)]
*  Did you ever go on the radio and say, I think they could upset LeBron or were [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1362.0s)]
*  you always like, I've never taken this seriously ever at any point? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1365.72s)]
*  No, I remember that team annoyed me, uh, because they wanted like five [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1369.4s)]
*  guys in the all star team because they were in first place. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1373.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1376.44s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, that's probably not a great way of doing the all star [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1376.72s)]
*  roster five, maybe an exaggeration. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1379.48s)]
*  Maybe it was four, but then if you look at the Celtics part of it, I mean, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1382.04s)]
*  that's why we're sitting here. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1389.6s)]
*  Like this is going to be ugly for Cleveland. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1390.56s)]
*  Like I said, like it's going to be really clean going. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1392.9599999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1395.24s)]
*  This it goes from, okay, there's new coach. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1395.52s)]
*  She figured some things out. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1398.12s)]
*  They're even better now coach of the year type of stuff. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1399.28s)]
*  And then no one's going to care. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1402.36s)]
*  No one's going to care about any of it. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1404.04s)]
*  Cause now they're going to say that this group just is incredibly flawed. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1405.36s)]
*  Um, well, and then you have this squandered opportunity of whether the [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1409.6399999999999s)]
*  Celtics come out of this round two series or not either way, it's going to [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1413.08s)]
*  be a six or seven gamer with some attrition. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1416.8s)]
*  And then Cleveland would have the home court in that one in Boston's a team. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1419.6799999999998s)]
*  They've always played well against and Mitchell's always done well against the [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1422.6799999999998s)]
*  Celtics. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1425.8s)]
*  Um, now you're like, well, we blew, like, what if the Knicks ended up beating the [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1427.48s)]
*  Celtics and like, we could fucking play the Knicks in round three. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1431.8s)]
*  But you know, the thing is, is after this series and the way this is looked, they [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1436.48s)]
*  shouldn't be saying that about anybody. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1439.84s)]
*  True. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1442.08s)]
*  How healthy do you think Garland is? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1443.8799999999999s)]
*  Give me a percent. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1445.3999999999999s)]
*  Healthy enough to be out there. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1446.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, he's made some plays. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1448.08s)]
*  Falling down twice, not being touched probably isn't a great time. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1449.6s)]
*  He fell down and got a foul call in today's game where I'm like, he just [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1454.24s)]
*  fell down, um, and then he had a play in game three where he like lost the ball. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1457.36s)]
*  He just tried to cut forward and then, then fell down again. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1462.56s)]
*  So, you know, I don't know if that's in the flow of the game or whatever, but I [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1465.1599999999999s)]
*  thought at least game three, it's like, okay, you know, he's out there. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1469.4399999999998s)]
*  I, you know, I don't think maybe he's marginalized a little bit, but I don't, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1471.9599999999998s)]
*  you know, what I don't see multiple moments where I'm like, Oh my God, this [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1478.56s)]
*  guy shot, I can't believe he's out on the floor. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1482.08s)]
*  You didn't look this, didn't was, I wouldn't say he was skipping around. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1483.6799999999998s)]
*  100%. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1489.76s)]
*  But he wasn't bad. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1490.84s)]
*  He wasn't compromised. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1492.08s)]
*  Certainly what it didn't really affect either way. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1493.32s)]
*  Um, I thought it was more of the Pacers were just extraordinary and also really [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1496.6399999999999s)]
*  seemed to think they can be equivalent. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1501.36s)]
*  That's a, that's a, that was another lesson in this game. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1503.8s)]
*  Like they were like, we're fucking beating these guys today. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1505.8799999999999s)]
*  This is happening. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1507.88s)]
*  We're beating these guys and, uh, I don't know. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1508.96s)]
*  This might be, you know, the times we've argued about it in the past, but even [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1513.44s)]
*  with, um, the health luck that they had against the opponents during the playoffs [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1517.92s)]
*  last year, just getting the Eastern conference finals and, you know, probably [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1522.72s)]
*  feeling like you were a lot closer with Boston and the series played out. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1527.5600000000002s)]
*  I mean, getting swept kind of separates the men from the boys in those closing [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1530.2800000000002s)]
*  moments, you're like, okay, you're not actually at this level, despite running [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1533.92s)]
*  around for two hours, but maybe that's all they needed and the strong clothes [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1536.76s)]
*  and the guy like Halliburton who does not care, which is why I think so many players [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1541.44s)]
*  despise him, but you need somebody like that. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1545.92s)]
*  You need somebody who thinks, especially when you have that many times with the [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1549.08s)]
*  ball and everything that you're controlling there, you have to think [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1553.2s)]
*  you're better than everybody else. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1556.36s)]
*  And he carries himself that way. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1557.32s)]
*  And look, I mean, depending on where he is, I think I voted them all NBA. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1559.28s)]
*  I know it kind of came down to like the last few names. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1563.56s)]
*  There's like three for one spot or maybe four names for two spots. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1565.92s)]
*  And I know some people probably split. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1569.76s)]
*  So I don't know if he's going to make 13 all NBA, but I voted for him. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1570.96s)]
*  I'm pretty sure I did kind of forget some of this stuff. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1573.68s)]
*  You did. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1575.64s)]
*  I didn't. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1576.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1577.28s)]
*  I didn't mean to do it to you that way. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1578.6000000000001s)]
*  That's not what I brought it up. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1580.04s)]
*  I stand by the, I was a regular season vote. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1581.88s)]
*  I voted for a big Jim Harden over him. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1583.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1587.8000000000002s)]
*  It's a regular season vote. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1587.88s)]
*  Do I feel great about it? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1589.04s)]
*  Not especially. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1590.2s)]
*  No, I don't feel awesome. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1592.3200000000002s)]
*  Not going to high five myself in there. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1595.1599999999999s)]
*  After they give us to the NBA, like hit us up a week or two into the playoffs [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1596.96s)]
*  and be like, anything you want to tweak. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1600.76s)]
*  I know this is a ball again. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1603.28s)]
*  I swear to God, every time like somebody becomes public and then it's like, oh, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1605.8799999999999s)]
*  this guy did this. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1609.84s)]
*  And sometimes I think it's because the person just does it. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1610.84s)]
*  And then there's just that moment where like, well, somebody left fronds off of [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1613.6799999999998s)]
*  all NBA first and second. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1617.24s)]
*  And then I'm like immediately going back to check my ballot. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1618.76s)]
*  Cause you're just horrified that you're going to make some mistake, but I don't [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1621.1599999999999s)]
*  think the NBA can go over our ballots and go, are you sure about that dude? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1624.04s)]
*  Although I'd love it. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1627.1599999999999s)]
*  What's the weirdest possible finals we can have that actually might happen now? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1629.04s)]
*  Is it Indiana and Minnesota? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1633.84s)]
*  Golden state in Minnesota or excuse me. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1635.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, what's the weirdest possible? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1639.1599999999999s)]
*  Well, weird as possible. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1640.6399999999999s)]
*  That could actually happen. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1642.1599999999999s)]
*  Like that could actually happen. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1643.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1644.92s)]
*  Indiana, Minnesota is a finals that could actually happen. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1645.2s)]
*  Wouldn't Denver Pacers be weirder? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1648.84s)]
*  I mean, the ABA part would be weirder, but Yoke Edge being in the finals. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1651.92s)]
*  I'm just trying to picture like a finals that people in our life who don't really [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1655.16s)]
*  follow basketball, like my mom, like who's in the finals this year. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1658.92s)]
*  And I'm like, it's Indiana against Minnesota. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1662.3200000000002s)]
*  Like what? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1665.2s)]
*  Or my wife. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1666.3600000000001s)]
*  That's one of those that you have Minnesota as this guy, Anthony Edwards, he was [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1668.0s)]
*  in an Adam Sandler movie and Indiana just has a bunch of guys you've never heard of, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1670.96s)]
*  but they're really fun to play or fun to watch. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1675.0400000000002s)]
*  And that's going to be our finals. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1678.3600000000001s)]
*  I would, I would be defending. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1679.84s)]
*  We would be defending ourselves against the ratings argument that would come out [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1683.84s)]
*  then that probably wouldn't be a great time for some of the current back and forth. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1688.9199999999998s)]
*  Pacers, T-Wolves. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1692.9199999999998s)]
*  Like, hey, they shouldn't have, shouldn't have. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1695.12s)]
*  Shake your butt. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1697.8s)]
*  Shake your butt a little early. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1698.8s)]
*  You see some of the players tweets. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1700.6s)]
*  It's all connected. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1701.8s)]
*  By the way, you know, it'd be a really good finals. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1703.32s)]
*  Indiana, Minnesota. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1705.28s)]
*  I would really enjoy those games. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1706.48s)]
*  Good battle. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1709.28s)]
*  I guess I don't look at like Minnesota as surprising, but they're another team. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1711.28s)]
*  You know, Western conference finals, same as the Pacers Eastern conference finals. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1716.64s)]
*  I felt like Minnesota had a much better chance in that series than the Pacers did [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1720.48s)]
*  last year, maybe, I don't know, this sounds stupid, but were we just do, I mean, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1724.3200000000002s)]
*  we're not even there yet. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1728.56s)]
*  We're not even through the second round. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1729.4s)]
*  So like do for just like a completely wild, like, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1730.72s)]
*  do for just like a completely wacko. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1734.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1737.24s)]
*  Are we just do for one of these instead of every year going, okay, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1737.52s)]
*  it's this team versus that team. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1741.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1742.96s)]
*  Well, they have the, one of the five best players in the world and they have two of [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1743.24s)]
*  the 10 best players in the world. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1747.1599999999999s)]
*  And that's the way the sport works. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1748.56s)]
*  I have the conference odds from right before round one in Indiana. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1751.28s)]
*  I thought it was a great bet. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1755.6399999999999s)]
*  And I actually had that in my picks. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1756.8s)]
*  Indiana was 28 to one to win the East, which I thought those are like just great [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1758.6s)]
*  odds. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1763.48s)]
*  I don't not saying it's going to happen. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1763.84s)]
*  It's just 28 to one playing Milwaukee in round one. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1765.24s)]
*  It's just good odds. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1769.08s)]
*  Minnesota was 20 to one to win the West. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1770.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1775.8s)]
*  And if you looked at that one, kind of the same thing where you go, all right, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1776.1599999999999s)]
*  well, if they get through round one, they're playing the winner Houston golden [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1780.52s)]
*  state in round two, they could potentially win that. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1783.56s)]
*  And then who knows they, they love playing. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1785.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1787.6799999999998s)]
*  See. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1787.9599999999998s)]
*  Um, but anyway, 28 to one versus 20 to one would be a very, very high parlay [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1789.0s)]
*  if you did that one on Fandl. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1795.36s)]
*  Denver was 15 one by the way. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1797.28s)]
*  Did they really? [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1800.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1801.08s)]
*  So maybe some momentum. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1801.76s)]
*  Cleveland was plus one 85 to win the conference and the Celtics were minus [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1804.0s)]
*  145 and the Knicks were 12 to one. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1809.04s)]
*  So yeah, all right. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1812.72s)]
*  Uh, and I'm way more nervous about the Celtic game now since we did the pod [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1815.3999999999999s)]
*  since, which hasn't even been on this, the people listening, we haven't even [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1819.52s)]
*  gotten to that yet it's about 40 minutes from now, but I started thinking about. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1822.6799999999998s)]
*  Um, this Indiana game made me now nervous that the salt though, just, you [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1826.6s)]
*  always think, you know, it's going to happen again. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1832.1599999999999s)]
*  It's like game four, it's going to suck fast. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1833.9199999999998s)]
*  Everyone's going to show them. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1836.0s)]
*  Then I watched this. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1836.6799999999998s)]
*  I'm like, all right, now I'm nervous again. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1837.36s)]
*  No, what to expect anymore. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1839.76s)]
*  I mean, it's just, is it the most impressive win of any game in the [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1845.08s)]
*  playoffs so far, right? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1849.36s)]
*  Mainly because it feels like they kind of broke the calves. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1851.36s)]
*  I think that was the more impressive part. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1854.1999999999998s)]
*  It broke me a little bit. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1855.8s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1856.6399999999999s)]
*  It's like one of those football games where you think the Cowboys lose 47 to 17 [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1857.32s)]
*  in round one, you're like, Oh my God, you didn't just lose. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1862.56s)]
*  Like, I don't even know what you should do this summer. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1865.76s)]
*  Now this episode is brought to you by degree original cool rush deodorant. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1867.8799999999999s)]
*  Remember last year? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1873.32s)]
*  People got really mad when degree changed their cool rush formula. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1874.84s)]
*  One dude even started a petition. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1878.9599999999998s)]
*  What was up with that guy? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1880.56s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1881.6399999999999s)]
*  Degree listened. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1883.12s)]
*  They admitted they messed up. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1884.48s)]
*  They are bringing back the original cool rush scent and thank God you've got [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1885.76s)]
*  a level of brand can own its mistakes and it's in Walmart, target and other [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1892.12s)]
*  stores right now for under $4. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1895.84s)]
*  Grab some, find out why it's been the number one men's antiperspirant. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1899.4399999999998s)]
*  For the last decade, by the way, you should put that on, especially [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1904.68s)]
*  we're about to hit the summer. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1907.9199999999998s)]
*  It's getting sweaty in the summers. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1909.12s)]
*  The original degree cool rushes back and it smells like victory for all of us. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crLeFmePPME&t=1910.8799999999999s)]
