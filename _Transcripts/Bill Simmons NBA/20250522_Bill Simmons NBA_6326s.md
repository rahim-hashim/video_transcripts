# Jon Stewart on Knicks Heartbreak, ‘Daily Show’ Lessons and NY Sports Fans | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=0.0s)]
*  This part of the podcast, a little after eight 30, right after game two, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=26.64s)]
*  okay. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=30.92s)]
*  See Minnesota. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=31.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=32.44s)]
*  See throttles, Minnesota. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=32.76s)]
*  And I gotta be honest, I'm a little concerned. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=34.88s)]
*  I'm a little concerned for the rest of the playoffs because it feels like, okay. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=37.96s)]
*  See who's already a great team. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=41.24s)]
*  Who was already 68 and 14 during this season. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=42.92s)]
*  They had a, they're plus 12.6 point differential in the playoffs. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  They're plus 14. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=51.84s)]
*  I mean, we had lots of reasons to already be concerned that they were going to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  rip through the playoffs and be a juggernaut. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=56.2s)]
*  The Denver series going seven, maybe open the window to, huh, maybe a minute. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=58.080000000000005s)]
*  No, their defense is just too good. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=63.64s)]
*  This is, this is turning into some 2000 Ravens kind of stuff. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=66.64s)]
*  Football analogy, um, 89 pistons, which was a totally different team. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=70.84s)]
*  Um, because they, uh, you know, they, they were really built around the nine man [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=75.88s)]
*  concept. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=81.4s)]
*  They didn't have the true superstar as great as Isaiah was. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=81.92s)]
*  Uh, this team is built around SGA who just scores between 30 and 40 points a [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=85.04s)]
*  game, no matter what the defense is doing. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=90.08s)]
*  Um, how many guys you they're throwing traps, 45, 45 feet from the basket. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=93.04s)]
*  Doesn't matter. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=97.4s)]
*  He's still getting in the basket. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  Uh, at the 38 or 40 tonight, he was just fantastic. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=99.44s)]
*  He's got this head-to-head battle against Anthony Edwards, who everybody wants to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  be the future of the league. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=106.2s)]
*  Cause he's young. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=107.16s)]
*  He's a little Jordanian. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  He's American. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  Uh, and SGA is just handing it to him in this series. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=110.92s)]
*  Opponents in the playoffs are 40% field goal, 30% from three against them. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  Heading into this game, they had 18.3 turnovers, a game that they were forcing. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=121.12s)]
*  And the defense is just so much better than anything. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=125.88s)]
*  Anyone else is doing. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=129.12s)]
*  We have four teams left and I just don't know if anybody can touch this team. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=130.16s)]
*  Vandal doesn't think so either because they're minus three 10 to win the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=134.84s)]
*  title at this point. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=137.56s)]
*  Indiana might be our only chance because they don't turn the ball over. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=139.04s)]
*  They're built around their guards. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=143.44s)]
*  They play this kind of funky pace that makes you come to what they want to do [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=144.84s)]
*  and the pace they want to play at. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=150.92s)]
*  Maybe they can mess. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=152.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=153.36s)]
*  See ya. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=153.68s)]
*  But honestly, I don't think it's going to matter. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=154.12s)]
*  Um, this, we got to this case, this point a little bit with the Celtics last [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=156.4s)]
*  year where the math just becomes the math. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=160.84s)]
*  If you have somebody that's winning 80% of their games, that's winning by [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=163.0s)]
*  between 10 and 15 points a game. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=166.68s)]
*  That is deep and young and has defense. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=169.4s)]
*  And home court advantage to flip it on them is going to be almost impossible, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=172.60000000000002s)]
*  which is why, you know, if there's a winner from these first two games, other [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  than okay, see another than Indiana for their comeback of the century yesterday. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=180.88s)]
*  Uh, Denver's gotta be feeling better about everything that happened. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=185.12s)]
*  Um, you know, they take this. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=188.72s)]
*  Frazee juggernaut of a team to seven and, uh, and then get killed in game seven, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=190.56s)]
*  but just even winning three games off this team, when you don't have a bench, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=195.68s)]
*  when you have four guys, it's kind of nuts and retrospect. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=198.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=201.72s)]
*  See, you might only lose three games of this entire playoffs, the way this is going. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=202.0s)]
*  So there's 78 and 17 for the season right now. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=206.0s)]
*  And if you go historically, um, I did this last year, cause it seemed like the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=209.32s)]
*  Celtics had a chance to go 80 and 20 in the season. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=214.0s)]
*  Um, the bulls were 87 and 13 in 1996. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=218.12s)]
*  That is, that's the mark. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=222.16s)]
*  I don't know if anyone's beating that in our lifetimes. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=224.24s)]
*  Lakers and 72 or 81 and 15, the 97 bulls were 84 and 17, 17 goal in state is 84 [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  and 16, and then the 67 76ers was 79 and 17. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=234.12s)]
*  And this okay. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  See team right now is 78 and 17, 84 and 17 is in play, which means they would [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=239.88s)]
*  basically force themselves into the all time conversation, even though we've [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=245.39999999999998s)]
*  been watching them going, I don't know. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=249.6s)]
*  They're a little young Jaylen Williams. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=251.12s)]
*  Is he good enough second? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=253.72s)]
*  I don't know about these three point shooters. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=255.28s)]
*  They're basically going to bolt those their way into the all time [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=257.64s)]
*  conversation that this keeps going. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=260.56s)]
*  And the thing that scares me, not just for the playoffs, but for the history [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=262.2s)]
*  stuff is that it feels like they're getting better. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=265.16s)]
*  It feels like defensively. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=267.52000000000004s)]
*  The whole flying around like pit bulls thing. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=269.76s)]
*  Now they're turning it on and off, you know, in the second quarter. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=272.24s)]
*  And by the way, I bet on Minnesota today, I thought Minnesota was going to show [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=275.68s)]
*  up big time, Scott Foster was there, the extender. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=279.12s)]
*  I was just like, all right, this is all the makings of, Whoa, I can't believe [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=281.52s)]
*  Minnesota tied the series. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=284.6s)]
*  And in the second quarter, they kept getting it to one point, two point. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=286.36s)]
*  And okay. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=290.28000000000003s)]
*  See, they, they do that thing. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=291.44s)]
*  They do. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=293.20000000000005s)]
*  They get a stop, they get a basket, get turnover, they get a basket. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=294.16s)]
*  They get another stop back. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=297.96000000000004s)]
*  And then it's a nine point game. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=299.0s)]
*  You're like, what just happened? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=300.32000000000005s)]
*  I was just talking myself into, into Minnesota being up at half time. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=301.96000000000004s)]
*  And now they're down 10. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=306.92s)]
*  What just happened? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=308.28000000000003s)]
*  And I think, okay. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=309.8s)]
*  See, he has more of those than any team. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=310.56s)]
*  I can remember, you know, we've, there's been some great defenses over the years. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  And I still feel like the 90, the 90, the early nineties bulls and the 96 [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=316.76000000000005s)]
*  bulls and the 89 pistons, there was some, the Oh four pistons were. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=322.04s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=326.20000000000005s)]
*  Um, this team has a really weird gear where all of a sudden they can go on an [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  eight, Oh 10, Oh run, and it feels like a fluke as it's happening. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=333.0s)]
*  It's like, Oh, that was a dumb pass. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=336.6s)]
*  Ah, I can't believe he dribbled it off his foot like that. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=338.6s)]
*  They, they forced these teams to have the dumbest turnovers. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=341.16s)]
*  Teams are throwing terrible entry pad. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=345.36s)]
*  There was a play, there was a sequence today where they tried to [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=347.72s)]
*  get the ball to Randall twice. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=350.8s)]
*  One time, deep in Chandra just, just misses him by five feet. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=352.8s)]
*  It was like an intercepted pass, like in football. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=355.84000000000003s)]
*  And then the other time he almost throws it away again, like teams can't even [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=358.56s)]
*  throw our entry passes against these dudes. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=361.68s)]
*  So the relentlessness of them is, is really something else. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=363.40000000000003s)]
*  And you know, if they ended up sweeping the timber wolves, that's usually a good [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=367.16s)]
*  sign for the finals too. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=370.88s)]
*  And the last 10 years, the only team there are five teams that had conference [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=372.08s)]
*  finals sweeps only the 2019 warriors didn't go on to win the finals and that. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=375.4s)]
*  Clay gets hurt. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  The rank gets hurt. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=380.84s)]
*  That was a stupid year. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=381.56s)]
*  Uh, for Minnesota, my only note other than, um, it feels like Randall got [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=383.04s)]
*  broken over the last three halves. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=388.64s)]
*  Not a good sign for them. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=390.44s)]
*  And the, and the fact that Naz read can't hit threes anymore for whatever reason, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=391.68s)]
*  they missed a bunch of corner threes. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=395.4s)]
*  I actually liked how patient Minnesota was today. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=396.88s)]
*  And they just kept missing like those get over the hump, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=399.84s)]
*  rally threes from the corners. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=402.08s)]
*  Um, my biggest note for them. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=404.28s)]
*  It's around three of the playoffs and you have an older team that's really physical. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=407.84s)]
*  Where's the physicality? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=412.56s)]
*  Why aren't you trying to bang this team around? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=414.48s)]
*  Why aren't you trying to turn this into like an eighties type of series? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=416.4s)]
*  There was one play where McDaniel shoved SGA from behind and they have, of course, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=419.8s)]
*  they had to review it because God forbid you touch anyone. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=425.0s)]
*  Um, but I was like, why, why doesn't that happen anymore? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=427.76s)]
*  Why aren't they talking shit? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=430.91999999999996s)]
*  Where's ant? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=431.96s)]
*  Why isn't ant talking shit? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=432.67999999999995s)]
*  It's almost like he knows. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=434.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=435.67999999999995s)]
*  C is better than him. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=436.32s)]
*  And so the one thing I want to see from them in game three is like, go back to. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=437.2s)]
*  The Minnesota team. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=441.47999999999996s)]
*  I remember that Minnesota team that even against like LeBron and the Lakers was [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=442.47999999999996s)]
*  talking, talking, talking the whole time. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=446.28s)]
*  There's a chance Minnesota is just not that good and that they lucked out playing [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=448.47999999999996s)]
*  that weird Laker team around one and then Curry gets hurt around too. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=451.59999999999997s)]
*  Um, can't be ruled out. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=455.03999999999996s)]
*  It did feel like they found something late with ant and Reed and McDaniels and [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=456.68s)]
*  Alexander Walker and, um, Conley, where they basically just put go bear and [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=461.08s)]
*  Randall took them out and tried to match athletes with them, but that's not going [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=465.64s)]
*  to work for four quarters. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=469.56s)]
*  They have to get go bear going. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=470.48s)]
*  They have to figure out how to get Randall into that 20 to 25 points again. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=471.64s)]
*  But, you know, again, this goes back to, okay, C is an answer for everything. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=475.84s)]
*  They'll just put Lou Dord on you and they'll just put Caruso on it. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=479.76s)]
*  It just doesn't seem to matter. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=481.96s)]
*  I still feel like the Quippers in the West were the team that matched up the [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=483.12s)]
*  best with okay. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=487.2s)]
*  See, and you know, I, this is the, going to be the playoffs that we look back and [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=487.96s)]
*  we're like, man, the playoffs were drunk that year. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=494.16s)]
*  There were so many weird, crazy games. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=496.16s)]
*  And one of them was that okay. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=498.76s)]
*  See, I'm sorry, the Quippers Denver game four that I went to that I keep mentioning [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=500.16s)]
*  that ended with the Gordon L. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=505.8s)]
*  You've dunked and I still feel like the Quippers win that game. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=506.88s)]
*  They're in the next round. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=510.28000000000003s)]
*  And I think the Quippers, okay. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=511.48s)]
*  See that would have been the best chance. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=512.64s)]
*  I think anyone in the West would have had a beating them. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=515.0s)]
*  And this is a conference that just had Denver take them to seven. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=517.28s)]
*  I think Indiana does have a chance. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=520.8s)]
*  I don't think the Knicks with, uh, you know, basically seven guys with the way [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=523.2s)]
*  that okay, see, we'd be able to just throw everybody at Brunson. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=528.64s)]
*  They'd be able to attack towns. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=531.28s)]
*  Um, I think it would be really hard for the Knicks on both ends in the seven [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=534.08s)]
*  game series against them, India. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=538.36s)]
*  Probably not easy either, but at least they could do the offense, uh, you [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=539.76s)]
*  know, the run and shoot, try to, uh, try to mess them up and, you know, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=544.88s)]
*  maybe it's Indiana's playoffs. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=550.4s)]
*  They've had three of the greatest comebacks in the history of the league. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=552.2s)]
*  They had the single best comeback when I've ever seen. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=555.12s)]
*  I tweeted it right afterwards, not knowing that, um, what was it? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=558.88s)]
*  One out of, it was the first out of 977 playoff games where somebody [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=562.84s)]
*  came back from that deficit of three minutes left. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=567.5999999999999s)]
*  It felt that way watching it. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=569.64s)]
*  I was like, I'm pretty sure I've never seen anything like this before. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=571.0s)]
*  Uh, it's the knees Smith game. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=574.16s)]
*  It's the Halliburton the bounce only the Kawhi against Philly. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=576.1199999999999s)]
*  I think a ball has ever bounced that high and gone in and a key moment. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=580.0s)]
*  Halliburton gives the choke sign, but then it's going to overtime and it [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=584.0s)]
*  seems like that is the biggest, oh my God, that's going to come back to [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=587.5999999999999s)]
*  Hanum didn't come back to Hanum. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=590.5999999999999s)]
*  And then, you know, the other legacy of that game is the Knicks. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=592.64s)]
*  You can't blame them. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=595.52s)]
*  They have won a title since 73, but you could feel the nerves coming [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=596.36s)]
*  through the TV on the OG free throws and the towns free throws. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=600.72s)]
*  So what's Friday night going to be like, you know, it'll be a drunk, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=603.88s)]
*  nervous New York crowd. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=608.04s)]
*  It'll be an Indiana crowd playing with house money. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=610.04s)]
*  And, uh, I'm not sure it's going to matter because it seems like, okay, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=612.28s)]
*  see is just clearly the best team. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=617.12s)]
*  Sometimes that's the way it goes. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=620.16s)]

*  What do you want? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=788.84s)]
*  Why are you bothering me? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=790.88s)]
*  You were so happy like a week ago. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=792.52s)]
*  That's this is, this is the power of the playoffs. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=795.8s)]
*  This is, this is how it goes. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=798.32s)]
*  This is, uh, the elation, the joy of each victory with the knowing [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=800.0s)]
*  knowledge of you're about to be emotionally thrown over a cliff and it's fuck man. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=805.0s)]
*  But you didn't go last night. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=812.88s)]
*  You sent your son who, who went, he went with his boys. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=813.92s)]
*  He's, is he a blank slate for playoff disappointment? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=817.68s)]
*  Because it's been so bad. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=820.64s)]
*  Like what is his history? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=821.7199999999999s)]
*  His history is so listen, I've thrown him down on. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=824.8399999999999s)]
*  Mets, uh, giants, Rangers and. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=829.28s)]
*  And the Knicks. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=836.56s)]
*  So he's actually not faced the like, like I was trying to explain him. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=837.68s)]
*  Like this is not even the most catastrophic loss that we've faced in [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=842.36s)]
*  the playoffs at the hands of the Pacers. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=847.6800000000001s)]
*  Like this isn't even, you know, you, you've got to understand like the [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=850.36s)]
*  nineties was just this, cause we were good in the nine, the Knicks were really [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=854.16s)]
*  good in the nineties, but just could never overcome either, you know, Jordan's [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=859.2s)]
*  greatness or LaJuan's greatness or just Reggie Miller's pain in the acidness. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=863.8000000000001s)]
*  Or, you know, but we faced the Pacers like six times in the nine, seven times [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=870.8000000000001s)]
*  in the end lost in like crazy ways. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=877.0400000000001s)]
*  Like, like Patrick Ewing, a seven foot one with a, I think a 28 foot [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=880.24s)]
*  wingspan missing a finger roll. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=887.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=889.72s)]
*  Like game seven, like you just literally, he could have just, just dunked it. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=890.0400000000001s)]
*  He decided, let me just see, let me see if it'll bounce off the back of the rim. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=894.6800000000001s)]
*  But it all, it all circled back with the four point shot and the worst call [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=897.76s)]
*  in the history of the playoffs. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=901.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=906.24s)]
*  Larry Johnson. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=906.76s)]
*  Let me tell you something about Larry Johnson. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=907.92s)]
*  That was as a matter of fact, and I'm glad that you brought this up because [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=909.4399999999999s)]
*  it's important for us to discuss this. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=913.08s)]
*  Larry Johnson suffered at the hands of that and one, and I'm glad that he got [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=915.24s)]
*  the call because he was a fragile flower. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=919.72s)]
*  You know that Larry Johnson had a very bad back. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=922.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=924.36s)]
*  And for any of those players to put his vertebrae in jeopardy like that, I [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=925.08s)]
*  thought was, I actually thought it should have been a flagrant too. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=930.5600000000001s)]
*  And an injection, like when Starks headbutted Reggie Miller, do you remember that? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=933.36s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=938.64s)]
*  Start, I think it was game, game three. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=939.08s)]
*  It might've been game three. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=942.0s)]
*  Nick's were up Starks, headbutts, Reggie Miller, and then Indiana goes on like a [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=944.12s)]
*  30 to 10 run runs away with it. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=950.0400000000001s)]
*  Reggie Miller goaded him into it. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=954.72s)]
*  Oh Jesus. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=956.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=957.32s)]
*  It's, it's nonstop. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=957.76s)]
*  I mean, but I, I have to tell you like, so he doesn't know it. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=959.28s)]
*  Your son was there. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=963.0400000000001s)]
*  Your son's what? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=964.44s)]
*  21, 22, 20. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=965.0400000000001s)]
*  He's 20, he's 20 years old. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=966.8000000000001s)]
*  And so, but he's in, he's as passionate about it as I am. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=968.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=974.88s)]
*  And loves it. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=975.1600000000001s)]
*  I've got pictures of him, you know, at the games with his SpongeBob backpack and [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=975.88s)]
*  is, you know, he's five years old, but like pointing at Eddie [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=981.0400000000001s)]
*  Curry and Zach Randolph wondering why they're starting to big. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=984.32s)]
*  He kept saying, he kept saying, so they've taken Rick Mahorn's ass and they've put [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=987.32s)]
*  it on these two players, but they don't have the rebounding ability of a Mahorn. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=993.36s)]
*  They just have the ass. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=998.96s)]
*  Uh, but yeah, so he, he just loves it. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1000.88s)]
*  And he's got a pretty good being raised as a Nick and Matt and, and giant and, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1005.0s)]
*  uh, and ranger fan. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1010.96s)]
*  He's got a pretty good tolerance for the beat down. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1012.36s)]
*  He's got a pretty good tolerance for the, uh, raised expectation [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1015.5600000000001s)]
*  followed by crushing disappointment. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1020.08s)]
*  Uh, I've raised, I've raised them. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1022.96s)]
*  Well, the giants piece of it, it was at least the one nice thing you did because [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1025.24s)]
*  like, I have a couple of friends who are, Nick's Jets. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1029.1200000000001s)]
*  I know, but the Nick's Mets Jets combo is almost like you're down the spiral of hell. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1033.0s)]
*  Can I tell you something? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1038.16s)]
*  And this, this is true. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1038.92s)]
*  There are States that will take away your children for that. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1039.92s)]
*  There are that they will bring out abuse. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1043.44s)]
*  They will bring in Diphys if you go down that route for, for, for too long. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1045.76s)]
*  But the nice part about it is he always has like his excitement around the [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1050.76s)]
*  draft or things like that. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1056.24s)]
*  Like there really is a, because there are so many sports teams here and it is [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1057.92s)]
*  really a nonstop, you know, and I'm always listening to, uh, the fan or, you know, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1063.16s)]
*  so whenever we're in the car, he just sits back and laugh at like Joey from, you [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1069.44s)]
*  know, uh, Queens or, you know, Frankie from Iceland, like, what are they doing? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1073.76s)]
*  Uh, so he, he loves that shit. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1079.72s)]
*  So I had some, uh, I talked to a bunch of Nick fans last night and today, some of [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1082.44s)]
*  whom were there. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1086.92s)]
*  Are you on a crisis hotline? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1087.88s)]
*  Is that what you're [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1089.28s)]
*  No, it's just a lot of people reach out to me. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1089.76s)]
*  I'm like a sports therapist. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1092.0s)]
*  Um, a friend of mine said, a friend of mine said the Charles Smith game is [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1094.04s)]
*  still the nadir and that nothing has, we'll ever compare to walking out. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1099.4s)]
*  First of all, the vibe at the end of the game, and then this complete [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1104.0400000000002s)]
*  silence leaving the arena. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1106.8000000000002s)]
*  He said was unparalleled that that was number one. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1109.0800000000002s)]
*  That's always going to be number one. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1111.76s)]
*  The Charles Smith game was the most excruciating, let's say 7.3 seconds of a [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1113.16s)]
*  Knicks, like, you know, because there were so many opportunities there for him to [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1121.92s)]
*  just, you know, I think he had three offensive rebounds in that sequence. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1127.8s)]
*  Something crazy might've gotten fouled at least twice, but that was back when [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1132.52s)]
*  they didn't call. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1136.76s)]
*  I mean, you, you look at the scores of these games and that, you know, like [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1138.0s)]
*  they beat them down 82 to 71. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1141.0s)]
*  It was a highest scoring game. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1143.6000000000001s)]
*  And, you know, I mean, these games were Reggie Miller. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1145.24s)]
*  That was the shocking part about some of the Reggie Miller performances is you'd [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1149.1200000000001s)]
*  see a game where it was like, uh, 82 76 and Reggie Miller would score 25 points [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1151.92s)]
*  in the last fucking quarter. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1156.84s)]
*  Like he would go off in a way that was just like now, you know, there are these [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1158.56s)]
*  guys that are pouring in 40 points, 30s, you know, last night Brunson cat, you [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1163.6399999999999s)]
*  know, Nesmith putting up, I don't know, threes out of nowhere. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1169.0s)]
*  He had eight threes. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1174.4399999999998s)]
*  Eight threes out of what? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1175.8s)]
*  Nine? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1177.36s)]
*  Something crazy. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1178.32s)]
*  Well, that's what's different now is these heat check guys don't have to be [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1179.36s)]
*  Reggie Miller anymore. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1182.48s)]
*  They're going to be Nesmith just going bonkers for a half hour. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1183.44s)]
*  Didn't you have Nesmith? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1187.76s)]
*  Wasn't he your guy? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1188.76s)]
*  We, we, we traded him in the, we trade him in the Brogdon trade. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1189.8400000000001s)]
*  When, uh, that paid off. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1194.0800000000002s)]
*  Oh, well that, there you go. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1196.16s)]
*  Well, he turned into drew holiday, which turned into a title. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1197.72s)]
*  So we, we still somehow considered a win, but you have a, I didn't even want to [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1200.0800000000002s)]
*  talk to you fucking like, here's the thing. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1203.92s)]
*  If you were a Nick fan, you wouldn't even be able to still talk to me right [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1207.0400000000002s)]

*  And so to just head up there, no plan, uh, no idea of where this thing was going to go. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1690.96s)]
*  I worked in catering kitchens, uh, bartended and, uh, all kinds of other odd stuff. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1696.92s)]
*  And just the ability to like walk home at three in the morning through [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1703.8000000000002s)]

*  So you go, you go to New York and you're basically like, I'm going to try to [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1719.56s)]
*  figure out how to be a comic and you're just put it together in a fly six week [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1723.32s)]
*  lease in an apartment. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1728.84s)]
*  I would see, I used to work in, uh, bars down in Jersey when I first got out of [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1731.08s)]
*  college and I was working at this one place called city gardens and it was a, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1736.1599999999999s)]
*  like a legendary punk club in Trenton, New Jersey. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1741.24s)]
*  And when I say like, like bad brains, black flag, suicidal tendencies, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1744.28s)]
*  misfits, like all the great punk bands of that era would roll through [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1749.72s)]
*  between New York and Philly. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1755.92s)]
*  So Trenton, it was this weird shit hole, like a warehouse, you know, uh, in the [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1757.16s)]
*  middle of like this very kind of dangerous place, it was a very dangerous place. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1764.16s)]
*  And, but all the bands that would come through, I'd get to interact with, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1770.6000000000001s)]
*  cause the bartender, you're up in the green room, you know, you're bringing [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1773.8000000000002s)]
*  them beers and booze. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1775.96s)]
*  And so you're, you might not remember this. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1777.3200000000002s)]
*  You might be too young, but do you remember Martha Quinn of MTV? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1780.3200000000002s)]
*  Of course. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1783.48s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1784.4s)]

*  Everybody's child. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1786.48s)]
*  I remember every, every moment of MTV. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1787.6000000000001s)]
*  So she was everybody's pixie and adorable thing. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1790.4s)]
*  Well, there was a band called Steve Bader's and the Lords of the New Church. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1793.3600000000001s)]
*  And Steve Bader's was the lead singer of Lords of the New Church. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1795.92s)]
*  He's on stage. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1798.84s)]
*  He's an addict, opiates, whatever. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1800.24s)]
*  He's on stage. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1804.08s)]
*  He's sick as a dog. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1806.32s)]
*  So he's, he's vomiting. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1808.28s)]
*  He looks like we need to get him that, you know, this is before they would do IV [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1810.6s)]
*  treatments, like for like hydrate people. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1816.28s)]
*  So he looks dehydrated near death. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1818.84s)]
*  I go upstairs to the green room after the show. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1822.52s)]
*  He's lying there kind of sort of comatose and I'm bringing booze in for everybody. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1824.8s)]
*  And Martha Quinn is in there on his lap. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1830.76s)]
*  And he kind of revives every now and then and, and, and is making out with her. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1834.9199999999998s)]
*  And I was like, boy, this industry is really, it's not what it appears to be on [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1839.44s)]
*  television. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1845.32s)]
*  It might be a little darker than what I had originally surmised. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1845.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1849.08s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1849.32s)]
*  It was a wild place, but it inspired me. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1850.52s)]
*  Cause I talked to these guys and they'd be like, what do you do? [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1854.2s)]
*  And I'd be like, uh, I get you drinks. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1856.4s)]
*  And they're like, is that it? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1859.48s)]
*  I'm like, kind of. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1860.24s)]
*  And it, it, I always had this idea in my head, like I wanted to try to be a comic [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1862.0s)]
*  or be a writer or some shit. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1865.52s)]
*  And they were like, so what do you do? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1866.48s)]
*  Why don't you do it? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1868.48s)]
*  And it, it kind of propelled me to one day I just sold all my shit and got a U [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1869.64s)]
*  hall drove up to the city and that was it. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1875.28s)]
*  Well, it probably made you realize how haphazard everything is in that you think [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1878.52s)]
*  in your head when you're growing up. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1882.4s)]
*  Oh, there's this whole process and you gotta do this and this, and then you get [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1884.5600000000002s)]
*  this and then you realize like, oh yeah, maybe just throw caution in the wind for [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1887.92s)]
*  six months that it might work out. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1893.16s)]
*  It might not. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1894.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1895.4s)]
*  You just make decisions. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1895.92s)]
*  And I remember telling people and they were just like, like, it's one of those [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1896.8000000000002s)]
*  things that were like, I don't think that, I don't think any part of that sentence [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1901.4s)]
*  that you just said makes sense. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1906.3600000000001s)]
*  Like I'm Lee, I'm leaving and you know, going to go to New York to be a comic. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1908.0400000000002s)]
*  And they'd be like, what? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1911.64s)]
*  Uh, but it was, it was, it was a ball in the late eighties. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1914.0s)]
*  The best case scenario for being a comic is maybe you get a 1230 show [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1917.96s)]
*  someday, maybe you get to tour the country. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1922.68s)]
*  Like what in your head, who's your role model? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1925.0800000000002s)]
*  Like Seinfeld country. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1927.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1928.72s)]
*  Well, no, those guys were so far above and beyond. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1929.0s)]
*  Look, if you're shooting for the stars, who are you looking at? [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1931.16s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1934.2800000000002s)]
*  I wasn't shooting for the stars. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1934.8400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1936.44s)]
*  That like, I wasn't thinking like that. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1937.0s)]
*  I think maybe that was partially how I was able to kind of endure whatever [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1938.9599999999998s)]
*  indignities get thrown your way. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1944.3999999999999s)]
*  Like how many times can you go to Carlos in the kitchen of panchitos and go, Hey [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1946.12s)]
*  man, uh, any chance you could make me like dinner and then maybe a breakfast too [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1949.24s)]
*  that I could put in a tin and just take with me. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1953.8799999999999s)]
*  Like it's a lot of indignity. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1956.04s)]
*  Uh, you know, you're, I'm a grown man at that time. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1958.1599999999999s)]
*  Like I'm not, I'm not, I'm sharing a room. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1961.52s)]
*  Like when was the last I shared a room when I was a kid, like when was the last [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1964.52s)]
*  time you shared a room, you know, I'm, I'm going to, I know how to drive. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1967.76s)]

*  Like it was, you know, you did, I didn't think, Oh man, I'm going to do my own. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1975.32s)]
*  They're going to discover me. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1984.2s)]
*  Like they discovered Seinfeld and Roseanne and it's going to be, and you're on. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1985.16s)]
*  It was, I hope I get good enough to pass the club. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1989.12s)]
*  Like there were milestones, but the milestones were much closer to your face [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=1993.2s)]
*  than what you would imagine. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2000.16s)]
*  You know, I imagine for you sort of a simply, like you think to yourself, I'm [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2002.8000000000002s)]
*  going to create a podcasting network and a, uh, and a conglomerate of writers [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2006.1200000000001s)]
*  and sports, you know, you don't, you think like, how am I going to get good at this? [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2011.76s)]
*  How am I going to get good enough at this that they'll let me work here for [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2016.0400000000002s)]
*  the $15 I might be able to get. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2020.68s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2023.64s)]
*  How do I get here? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2024.5600000000002s)]
*  So they'll let me work on the weekend. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2025.64s)]
*  Like that's where, like, put, they put cash money in your pocket. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2028.0s)]
*  Like if you could do five sets at different clubs on a Friday night, six [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2031.8000000000002s)]
*  sets, Attell was the king of that. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2036.3200000000002s)]
*  Attell was, he would do like nine or 10 sets in a night. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2039.1200000000001s)]
*  Like, Oh my God, the most industrious, like you would barely see him. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2045.3600000000001s)]
*  You'd wander in real quick with the cigarette dangling, go up on stage, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2051.04s)]
*  bang out 20 minutes of fucking hilarity. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2054.36s)]
*  Pop into the subway right uptown. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2057.16s)]
*  Cause you had to go, the circuit was the cellar downtown Boston comedy, but you [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2059.56s)]
*  also had comic strip, uh, catch a rising star uptown, uh, stand up New York. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2064.6s)]
*  Although they did like weekend bookings. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2069.24s)]
*  So you had a bunch of places, but you had, you had to travel. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2071.24s)]
*  Caroline's at the seaport then in midtown. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2074.7599999999998s)]
*  So it was like a little, little troubadours. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2078.6s)]
*  How long did it take you to get good at? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2081.16s)]
*  Uh, I'll let you know when I get good at it. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2083.96s)]
*  Well, when did you feel like, okay, I actually feel like I [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2086.68s)]
*  somewhat know what I'm doing here. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2089.96s)]
*  I think it was, and I wouldn't know, you know, the dates I can tell you. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2092.7999999999997s)]
*  The process of it was I worked at the cellar, which was just a few doors down [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2097.88s)]
*  from that bar I was working at. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2105.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2107.44s)]
*  And, uh, this guy built run fest and Rick chrome who sort of ran it, booked it, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2107.96s)]
*  let me hang out there every night. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2112.88s)]
*  Not obviously on the weekends where the real comics were. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2115.04s)]
*  And they would put me on every night as the last guy. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2117.92s)]
*  So Sunday to Thursday, I'd go on it one in the morning, two [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2120.84s)]
*  30 in the morning, depending on. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2124.48s)]
*  You know, comedy center, the comedy cellar back then wasn't what, what you [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2126.48s)]
*  know it as today, which is like Monday night, they're doing three sold out shows [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2130.4s)]
*  for, you know, and packing it in. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2135.16s)]
*  And it's all just like really great, really established comments, like best [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2137.08s)]
*  shows you would ever see in your life. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2141.68s)]
*  And then even in the middle of it, Chris Rock will show up and like bang out a set, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2144.4s)]
*  you know, crazy stuff. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2147.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2149.12s)]
*  So, you know, they would put me on every night and you learn how to be yourself. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2150.04s)]
*  You learn how to be yourself on stage, which is the only way you can create a [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2158.92s)]
*  kind of sustaining comedy career. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2162.44s)]
*  And, and I remember doing that and you just, you do reps, just do, you know what? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2166.8s)]
*  It felt like being like a gym rat, a comedy gym rat. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2173.08s)]
*  And, you know, it was you and the waitstaff and the occasional table of like [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2176.92s)]
*  drunk Norwegian sailors or whoever might wander down there because the place [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2183.44s)]
*  wasn't packed. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2187.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2188.7200000000003s)]
*  It's not like they started the show at eight and they ran it till the last person [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2189.7599999999998s)]
*  left and I was the guy getting your reps in. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2193.92s)]
*  And that's when I started to feel like I figured it out in a way that didn't feel [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2197.84s)]
*  embarrassing. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2204.08s)]
*  If that's [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2205.2s)]
*  well, plus you're allowed to make mistakes. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2206.88s)]
*  Like I look back when I had my calm before I got to ESPN, I was on my own for [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2209.6s)]
*  four years, just writing comms and some of them are good. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2213.64s)]
*  Some of them are bad. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2216.88s)]
*  I'm making a ton of, but I was able to make these mistakes with not a big [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2217.72s)]
*  audience, right? [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2221.3599999999997s)]
*  And then you learn from that. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2222.48s)]
*  And then by the time you get the audience, you have enough of a feel of what's [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2223.4399999999996s)]
*  going to work and not work. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2227.8399999999997s)]
*  So I was so frustrated those four years. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2229.48s)]
*  I'm like, is this ever going to happen? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2232.48s)]
*  Should I go into real estate? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2234.08s)]
*  What should I do? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2235.12s)]
*  But then you look back and you're like, Oh, that's actually really good. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2236.4399999999996s)]
*  It played out this way that I spent that much time trying to figure out how to [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2239.9599999999996s)]
*  get good at something, because then when it happened, I was ready for it. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2244.0s)]
*  You were, you were in column college. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2247.24s)]
*  Like that's, it's an essential learning experience, but that's also what you [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2249.3199999999997s)]
*  have to want. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2255.96s)]
*  Like it sounds like you wanted to be a writer, not a, not a star. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2257.2s)]
*  And the people that I always really loved were the people that wanted to be. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2263.56s)]
*  Comics, not stars. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2271.96s)]
*  They might get good enough to be like the way I sort of looked at it was if I get [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2274.88s)]
*  good enough, it'll be like bartending, like something you can make enough money [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2278.88s)]
*  with that you'll be okay. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2283.28s)]
*  And then occasionally people would show up. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2286.32s)]
*  Like, I remember when Chappelle showed up. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2287.8s)]
*  I mean, he was like every now and again, somebody would come in. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2290.92s)]
*  That's just built different. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2293.6400000000003s)]
*  Like a lot of us are, you know, you're, you're in there doing your work a day [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2295.7200000000003s)]
*  sets and trying to make your way and kind of build, and then a kid will come in [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2299.6800000000003s)]
*  and you just go, Oh, well, that's just touched by God. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2304.4s)]
*  That's just the diff. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2308.2400000000002s)]
*  That's just a weirdly different prodigy. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2309.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2312.56s)]
*  Um, and, and I always, I always felt good at not feeling mad about that. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2312.88s)]
*  Like, I remember seeing Dave and just going like, I love that. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2325.1200000000003s)]
*  I love that that kid can do that rather than feeling like, Oh, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2330.44s)]
*  why is that guy so good? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2334.16s)]
*  I'm just funny. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2335.24s)]
*  It's because I always get threatened by it. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2335.7599999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2338.24s)]
*  Cause I watched a lot of guys where bitterness stole whatever shot they had. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2338.96s)]
*  Like I always tried to maintain that feeling of no matter, like people say, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2346.92s)]
*  like, when did you think you made it? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2353.12s)]
*  And I'm like, here's when I made it. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2354.48s)]
*  When I left Trenton, that's when I made it. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2356.36s)]
*  Like everything else is gravy. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2359.64s)]
*  Like you, you tried the thing. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2362.4s)]
*  Like that's all you can give yourself as an opportunity and work your ass off at it. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2365.0s)]
*  But like, you always try to maintain that kind of feeling of proud of yourself, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2369.84s)]
*  no matter what happened, because you did the hard thing, which was to cleave [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2377.48s)]
*  yourself from your old life that was, could, would have been fine. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2383.84s)]
*  Well, the funny thing about your industry at the time is you have all these damaged [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2388.72s)]
*  people who are really good at what they do. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2393.3599999999997s)]
*  And a lot of them are just prenaturally bitter. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2395.12s)]
*  There's going to be bitter anyway. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2398.7599999999998s)]
*  And super mad at everybody who's more successful than them. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2400.04s)]
*  That's part of the comedy industry. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2403.6s)]
*  But I didn't find that to be the general, like that was the whole, the reputation of [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2404.9599999999996s)]
*  comics is like damaged people doing a damaged thing. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2409.8399999999997s)]
*  Like they were the funniest, smartest, nicest, like often warmest people you'd ever [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2413.4399999999996s)]
*  come across. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2423.2799999999997s)]
*  Like we all have our shit, but this idea of like, what's up, sad clown, masking your [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2424.24s)]
*  pain, like it didn't feel that way. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2431.64s)]
*  It felt like people excited to be in this very fertile, creative environment. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2434.48s)]
*  I mean, we all worked, we wrote for like Caroline's comedy hour and comedy central [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2441.44s)]
*  came on board in the middle of it. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2446.72s)]
*  And like, some of us got like little jobs there, like, but it felt, you know, I can [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2448.2s)]
*  only imagine like a creative scene that if not relevant, was it least like it was, it [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2454.96s)]
*  was, it was constructive. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2468.64s)]
*  It was like, you felt the excitement of it because we were getting to do what we [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2470.08s)]
*  wanted to do. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2475.12s)]
*  Like it was a crazy, wonderful, weird, dumb life. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2476.7599999999998s)]
*  I think the thing I was always jealous of from afar. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2482.84s)]
*  When I moved out, I had to work for Kimmel and he was dating Sarah and Sarah had this [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2486.04s)]
*  whole web of people and it was almost like a sports team. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2490.72s)]
*  She knew everybody and she was down there for each other. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2494.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2498.08s)]
*  And she was unbelievably good. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2498.24s)]
*  Another one that was just young, but really fucking good. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2501.3599999999997s)]
*  Kind of knew what their voice were. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2505.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2506.4399999999996s)]
*  But they, the way they all pulled for each other and how they knew everybody and they [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2506.6s)]
*  were all, it was, I was like, wow, this is not what I expected from the comedy [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2509.8399999999997s)]
*  industry, that it was a little more rowing the same way than on the boat. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2513.8399999999997s)]
*  Then I kind of thought you would get a dick or two, but it was the exception, not [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2518.56s)]
*  the rule. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2524.7599999999998s)]
*  And even the people that you thought like, wow, that, that person's dealing with a [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2526.1600000000003s)]
*  lot. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2530.1600000000003s)]
*  They generally didn't take it out on you. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2531.2000000000003s)]
*  You were part of their support, not a part of their attack. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2533.88s)]
*  Um, so I have nothing but ridiculously fond memories and I'm sure there's a [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2538.6000000000004s)]
*  little gloss of nostalgia, uh, you know, that carries over maybe some of the [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2545.1200000000003s)]
*  tougher times. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2549.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2550.6800000000003s)]
*  But, uh, but I think if you didn't, if it hadn't been somewhat painful and [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2550.84s)]
*  somewhat of a struggle, I don't think it would mean much in the aftermath. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2559.6800000000003s)]
*  If you didn't feel like you had to develop, you know, it's like when you talk [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2565.28s)]
*  to a guitar player and, you know, and they play unbelievable and then they show you [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2570.2000000000003s)]
*  pictures of like the blisters on their hands and you're like, yeah, that's no [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2573.2400000000002s)]
*  blister, no solo. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2577.1600000000003s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2579.48s)]
*  Like it's, it's part of the process from the MTV show. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2580.04s)]
*  Like you probably do this show. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2585.4s)]
*  What did it last? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2587.04s)]
*  Two years, three years to, I think. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2587.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2590.72s)]
*  Something like that. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2590.92s)]
*  Then, then it's done. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2592.04s)]
*  You move on to other things, but now we're in this YouTube video era and all of [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2593.12s)]
*  these clips come back from it. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2597.6s)]
*  And one of the things that's amazing about that show, Oh, yeah. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2599.4s)]
*  Well, one of the things that's amazing about it, you had, you had unbelievable [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2603.08s)]
*  music on that show. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2606.32s)]
*  That's part of it. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2607.68s)]
*  A lot of these artists, like that's kind of, it was kind of the prime apex of [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2608.24s)]
*  their careers during this amazing music time. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2612.9599999999996s)]
*  We had that was, we had a guy named Bruce Lee Gilmer, who was the music [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2616.04s)]
*  booker and Beth McCarthy was the director of the show. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2620.12s)]
*  And she had been a director at MTV, did all the live, like if you ever watch, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2622.64s)]
*  uh, Nirvana unplugged or those kinds of things, Alex Coletti had come up with, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2627.12s)]
*  uh, the, the, the concepts and was doing the unplugs, but Beth was directing them [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2633.3599999999997s)]
*  all. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2636.9199999999996s)]
*  Uh, you know, and you see even in that Nirvana unplugged that little moment where [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2638.3199999999997s)]
*  like Kirk turns and smiles, uh, to the camera that was Beth going like, are you [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2641.72s)]
*  having fun here? [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2646.7599999999998s)]
*  Kurt? [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2647.6s)]
*  Like, uh, but she's, uh, to, to my mind, like the greatest live music [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2648.56s)]
*  director of all time, like she's just phenomenal. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2654.24s)]
*  She went on, she did, you know, uh, Saturday night live, but she directed. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2656.64s)]
*  Our show, our dopey little show for the whole time it was on. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2662.4799999999996s)]
*  She was, it's the, it's the peak of alternative. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2666.3599999999997s)]
*  Hip-hop's coming super hard at that point. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2669.8799999999997s)]
*  Just everything is, everything is humming in 93 and 94. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2673.04s)]
*  When we were done at MTV, we went over to Paramount and I think the first week on [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2677.12s)]
*  the air, the musical guests were public enemy and Johnny Cash. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2681.52s)]
*  And like that was the breadth of it. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2687.64s)]
*  Biggie Smalls was on, uh, ODB Wu Tang. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2690.12s)]
*  Uh, Mike watt came on and growl played drums while Eddie Vedder and Pat [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2694.4s)]
*  smear played guitar for him. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2701.08s)]
*  Like it was insane. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2702.96s)]
*  Slayer, uh, Danzig, like it was the breath of it. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2706.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2713.68s)]
*  I enjoyed playing mother, baby. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2714.0s)]
*  Played mother. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2715.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2716.08s)]

*  No, I love those guys. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2720.64s)]
*  And they were all like, again, like I know the reputation, like, Oh, everybody [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2721.8s)]
*  comes on and there's attitude and all that shit, none of it, like they were all [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2729.32s)]
*  hanging out in the green room with, you know, Trent Rouser and Marilyn Manson. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2733.92s)]
*  Like it was crazy. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2739.0800000000004s)]
*  And it was so much fun, but the music was so good and such an important part of it. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2740.84s)]
*  And like we were able to sneak in, you know, guided by voices and, uh, uh, bad [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2746.2s)]
*  religion and bands that were like, not quite mainstream, but really great, you [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2752.96s)]
*  know, Buffalo Tom, uh, kind of closer in there. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2760.3999999999996s)]
*  I remember a bunch of them. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2764.12s)]
*  Just, it was an incredible, that was my favorite part of the, of the show. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2765.64s)]
*  Loved it. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2771.64s)]
*  I thought the show, I don't know. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2772.3999999999996s)]
*  I thought the show was good and it had a weirdly important place in pop culture [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2774.16s)]
*  because MTV, that was the height MTV, all that shit, you know, who didn't. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2778.24s)]
*  Well, we're the executives that were in charge of the program when they canceled. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2784.0s)]
*  No, the MTV one actually we did really well in the ratings. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2787.04s)]
*  It was when we went to Paramount, got syndicated is when that's when it went. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2789.96s)]
*  I blame that on baby doll completely. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2795.12s)]
*  I told him, I said, don't do this. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2797.7599999999998s)]
*  No, he's like, baby, it's a lot of money. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2799.6s)]
*  We got to do this. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2801.52s)]
*  No, it was what happened was Arsenio left and Paramount owned MTV. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2802.56s)]
*  And so they bought us to do that. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2808.24s)]
*  But we didn't realize like, you'll be on at three in the morning in Houston and [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2812.6s)]
*  11 o'clock at night in, you know, Atlanta. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2816.64s)]
*  Uh, but even that was a great experience. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2820.36s)]
*  And to go to our earlier point, when you get canceled and your name is on the [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2825.0s)]
*  show, like when they come into the office and go that show with your name on it. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2831.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2835.4s)]
*  I've had the experience. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2836.4s)]
*  It's not great. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2837.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2838.52s)]
*  It's not great, but what's better than waking up the next day and going, Oh, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2839.0s)]
*  I'm still alive and I can still write jokes and I can still do the shit that I [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2846.4s)]
*  love to do and I'll, it won't maybe in that venue, but I can go off and do it. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2850.88s)]
*  That's the crazy part about, I think the way that people view the kind of [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2856.76s)]
*  stereotypes of the businesses that we're in. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2863.4s)]
*  And I heard Jack Antonoff actually summed this up really well. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2865.88s)]
*  I can't remember the interview I was watching, but Jack Antonoff was talking [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2868.68s)]
*  about going into music and he would be like, I'm going, I'm thinking about going [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2871.6s)]
*  into music and everybody would say to him like, what are you crazy music? [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2875.6s)]
*  What do you think you're doing? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2880.64s)]
*  But if he had said, I want to be an astronaut, they'd all be like, yes, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2882.92s)]
*  fantastic. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2886.84s)]
*  But then he goes, but how many, there's like seven astronauts. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2887.68s)]
*  Music is everywhere. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2890.72s)]
*  Like why wouldn't they say, Oh, you love music. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2892.12s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2895.24s)]
*  It's everywhere. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2896.68s)]
*  And that's, they view these careers as like not safe as a lark, as an indulgence. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2897.96s)]
*  But comedy is everywhere. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2907.48s)]
*  Sports are everywhere. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2908.56s)]
*  Writing is everywhere. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2910.0s)]
*  Like, why wouldn't you say to somebody, Oh, if that's what you love, you'll [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2912.64s)]
*  probably work your ass off at it. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2917.88s)]
*  And you'll probably end up, you might not get to here, but you might be fine. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2921.0s)]
*  You might make enough to make a living and have a family. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2926.7599999999998s)]
*  Like, why wouldn't that be encouraged? [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2929.88s)]
*  I think so. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2933.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2934.0s)]
*  Oh, good. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2934.2s)]
*  No, I was just going to say so that when the cancellation came as hard as it was, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2934.7999999999997s)]
*  it was also freeing. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2938.6s)]
*  Cause I realized like, Oh, I still get to do the very thing that I came up here to [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2942.08s)]
*  do. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2948.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2949.2s)]
*  Well, I think the difference now, the potential of becoming either famous or [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2950.56s)]
*  successful seems easier because we have all of these different levers you can pull [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2955.72s)]
*  now. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2959.16s)]
*  Like somebody could just start a video podcast on YouTube and actually get an [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2959.7999999999997s)]
*  audience pretty fast. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2966.04s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2967.3199999999997s)]
*  I just feel like, Oh, they definitely do. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2968.24s)]
*  So first of all, you can have an audience too soon. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2971.52s)]
*  Second of all, you have the potential of this could happen to me soon, which I [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2973.8399999999997s)]
*  think skews the brain chemistry a little bit where you're like, right. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2977.6s)]
*  Why is this happening yet? [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2981.56s)]
*  It's been three months. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2982.56s)]
*  And I think what was different about our generation was, was you'd never, never [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2983.68s)]
*  really thought it was going to work out. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2990.68s)]
*  And if it worked out, that would be great. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2992.96s)]
*  But there was, there was no, it wasn't like there was like this prize in the [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2994.72s)]
*  bottom of the cracker jack box. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=2999.08s)]
*  You're like, man, I really hope this works out, but I have no idea if it is. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3000.6s)]
*  Now it feels like it can work out, which I think why people even get more and more [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3003.52s)]
*  frustrated when it doesn't, you know, maybe the key to our generation was a [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3007.56s)]
*  utter lack of confidence. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3012.0s)]
*  That was Gen X and right before Gen X of like, yeah, this actually might not happen. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3013.96s)]
*  There were viral sensations back when we were younger too. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3020.68s)]
*  It was just a different mentality. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3025.0s)]
*  You know, it, they didn't have the, you know, I'm sure there was a, you know, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3027.92s)]
*  an analog to Hawk to a, you know, back then, you know, but it, but it would be [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3033.92s)]
*  somebody like Donna Rice or one of those people. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3038.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's exactly. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3040.6800000000003s)]
*  That's the perfect analogy to although, yeah, somebody that came up through [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3041.76s)]
*  notoriety and maybe infamy, but didn't necessarily have something attached to [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3047.1600000000003s)]
*  that, but then took those opportunities beyond that to go on all kinds of. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3053.2000000000003s)]
*  You know, write a book or be on shows or that kind of shit. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3058.4s)]
*  You're listening and watching the Bill Simmons podcast presented by Fandel, our [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3062.6400000000003s)]

*  Visit rg-help.com. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3104.0s)]
*  One of the things as, as we get older and we watch our culture changes, like one [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3106.6800000000003s)]
*  of the things that's so interesting to me is the late night host piece. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3111.4s)]
*  Like it seems like CBS is just going to dump the 1235 spot that used to be. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3114.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3119.44s)]
*  Breeding ground for new comics, right. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3119.72s)]
*  It'd be like, or new hosts, or this would be either you put somebody who was [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3121.7599999999998s)]
*  established or you'd put somebody who has a chance to basically become you. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3125.64s)]
*  And now there's two problems with it. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3130.16s)]
*  One is the audience is just dwindled to the point that it's like Kimmel and [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3132.12s)]
*  Colbert and, and Fallon and Seth. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3136.48s)]
*  And maybe those are the last four we're going to have in a network. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3138.64s)]
*  But then the other piece is, right. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3141.84s)]
*  If you're going to try to get somebody young up and coming, is that even a good [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3143.72s)]
*  move for them in the same way? [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3148.32s)]
*  Are they just better off being on the road going around? [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3149.76s)]
*  Like, I would think those people would rather be Nate Barghazi who may, who's [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3152.48s)]
*  now doing basketball rain. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3156.64s)]
*  That's the issue, right? [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3158.2s)]
*  I think those people would rather be the biggest comic in the country. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3159.4s)]
*  Like that's not really how it, but 10 years ago, Nate Barghazi or five years [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3162.52s)]
*  ago, probably gets the 1230 thing over happening over having happened. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3167.76s)]
*  What happened to him? [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3172.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3173.0400000000004s)]
*  Cause the old model of how it happens. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3173.84s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3175.84s)]
*  Or a sitcom or something along those lines or other things. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3176.36s)]
*  But now you're just better off going to the people and going on tour. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3182.5600000000004s)]
*  And some of that is just ubiquity. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3185.2400000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3187.8s)]
*  So people don't, those sorts of talk shows do provide, I think, a kind of [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3188.2000000000003s)]
*  weird repetitive habit forming. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3194.8399999999997s)]
*  Like I go to bed watching the tonight show or Colbert or Kimmel, and I wake [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3198.96s)]
*  up watching GMA or the today's, you know, that's always been kind of the, [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3205.16s)]
*  the idea of it is to lock people into a brand. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3210.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm, I have a CBS lifestyle. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3215.56s)]
*  I have an NBC lifestyle, you know? [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3217.6s)]
*  And if you want, if you look on YouTube, there's still millions and millions [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3220.48s)]
*  of people, you know, the ratings traditionally are maybe not the same, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3224.04s)]
*  but I would argue the reach of it is maybe bigger. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3229.8s)]
*  It may not be monetized through advertising dollars in the way that they [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3233.6s)]
*  think makes it an efficient use of network capital, but in terms of its ability [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3237.2s)]
*  to permeate and people to see it, I think is still really, really large. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3243.12s)]
*  You know, you, it's shifted to YouTube and Spotify and you look at set, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3249.2s)]
*  we'll do a bit, you know, on it's 1230 at night, which was never like a huge [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3253.24s)]
*  audience thing, but he'll get millions of people watching it on YouTube or Facebook [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3258.52s)]
*  or whatever the hell people watch stuff. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3263.2799999999997s)]
*  Now, um, Malaney's doing a cool thing on Netflix, like just allowing [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3265.04s)]
*  himself like to do, to, to just be as creative as like old time letterman. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3270.3199999999997s)]
*  On a weekly basis on Netflix, they've given him kind of the leeway to be [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3276.4799999999996s)]
*  able to do all that stuff. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3282.16s)]
*  I think what will ultimately happen is you'll still have something that resembles [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3284.48s)]
*  it, but maybe not with the infrastructure. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3291.2s)]
*  We're, we're carrying an old, like the way I look at it is like, I run a tower [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3294.92s)]
*  records, do you know what I mean? [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3301.4s)]
*  Like people are always going to want music and I, but I'm still the guy who's [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3303.2799999999997s)]
*  like, well, come into my giant building and let me show you the new CD rack. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3307.3199999999997s)]
*  Like I'm, it's just a delivery system of something that I think people will [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3311.92s)]
*  always find somewhat interesting or appealing, but without the brick and [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3316.36s)]
*  mortar, like you, you watch a Z-Way or somebody who's doing something really [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3323.88s)]
*  interesting, creativity finds a way. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3329.4s)]
*  Like great, funny, interesting people find a way to make topical commentary [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3332.84s)]
*  or interviewing interesting for people. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3339.84s)]
*  And that's, that's always going to be something that I think will have appeal. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3343.88s)]
*  It just may not have an appeal with 250 employees in a giant theater. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3349.6000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3356.0s)]
*  With people coming every day. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3356.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3358.0s)]
*  Well, it's interesting with you, you're just doing Mondays now. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3359.1200000000003s)]
*  Oh, God bless. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3362.36s)]
*  That's, and your show and you on that show still feels like it has the same [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3364.84s)]
*  impact, but you're not having to do the, you know, you're not pitching every day. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3369.52s)]
*  You're pitching, you're not starting, you're not throwing the 120 innings. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3374.16s)]
*  I come back in, I do that thing now that like Aaron Rogers can do, like where [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3382.0s)]
*  you do the thing where you're like, I'm going to go on a darkness retreat and [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3385.44s)]
*  then maybe I'll sign in September, but I don't want to go to practice. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3388.0s)]
*  Is that okay with everybody? [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3391.72s)]
*  You know, it's that kind of shit. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3393.04s)]
*  Did you worry? [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3394.56s)]
*  I mean, obviously you know what you're doing, but you hadn't done that show. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3396.08s)]
*  And then you're doing that first show. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3399.32s)]
*  We did. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3401.36s)]
*  Were you nervous or did nervous energy? [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3402.2400000000002s)]
*  Like, what was it? [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3405.84s)]
*  What was it like to just do it again? [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3406.48s)]
*  Well, look, the muscle memory, I think one of the advantages I had is the people [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3409.04s)]
*  that the really talented, creative writers, producers, and all that of that. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3413.6800000000003s)]
*  You know, it's, it's a, it's an organism, it's a mechanism and the people that did [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3419.84s)]
*  it when I was there were still there. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3424.96s)]
*  Only they had all leveled up their skills. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3428.52s)]
*  Like they had all done boss battles. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3431.0s)]
*  And so now I was walking back into the place where it was the comfort of all [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3433.12s)]
*  these people I love, like I will say, we have a fucking ball. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3437.8s)]
*  Like I know that that's, I think everybody works hard, but it is fun. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3441.76s)]
*  Like they're great people. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3445.56s)]
*  I love being around them. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3446.96s)]
*  They've leveled up their skill level. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3448.32s)]
*  So that part I wasn't nervous about. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3449.8s)]
*  I was, man, it's a weird, it's hard to describe the feeling. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3452.76s)]
*  The first day I went in to do the show and I'm sitting behind the desk in rehearsal [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3460.36s)]
*  and, and a lot of the camera guys, this guy Phil, this TQ and Richie, they're all [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3466.6400000000003s)]
*  behind the cameras. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3472.6800000000003s)]
*  It's like people that, you know, I've been with for 30 years, so I knew them all. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3473.36s)]
*  So it's not like I was like, where am I? [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3477.5600000000004s)]
*  Who were you? [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3479.4s)]
*  Where am I? [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3480.04s)]
*  Who were you? [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3480.68s)]
*  You know, the comfort was there. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3482.16s)]
*  We did the rehearsal, but when I put the suit on and I came down and I sat behind [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3485.36s)]
*  the desk in the suit and I looked into the camera and saw on the monitor myself at [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3492.4s)]
*  the desk in the suit with the script, had the pen, the whole deal, but I look like [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3500.44s)]
*  this now, but you're older. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3508.08s)]
*  It looked like, do you know those like Instagram posts where they're like a [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3510.92s)]
*  friend group that takes the same picture every 10 years and like, there's that [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3515.6s)]
*  one year where everybody looks old all of a sudden, right? [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3520.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3523.04s)]
*  And that was daunting because it was a very strange, like kind of melancholy [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3524.04s)]
*  feeling of the evidence of, you know, decrepitude is too strong a word, but [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3533.8s)]
*  you do look at that and think, oh shit. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3542.8s)]
*  Like it was explicit evidence of passage of time. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3546.8s)]
*  Well, that's the, that's the phenomenon of like high school graduations, [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3553.28s)]
*  college graduations, weddings. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3556.6400000000003s)]
*  When, when we were younger and we'd watch the parents crying and be like, [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3558.4s)]
*  this fucking idiots, why are they, what are they so upset about? [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3562.36s)]
*  But then you get it as you're get older and like, fuck. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3564.6400000000003s)]
*  And as your kids get older. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3568.48s)]
*  And so as I sat there, it really was a stark feeling for me. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3569.6800000000003s)]
*  And also wondering if the audience would be able to get past it to just [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3575.88s)]
*  hear the jokes and, and, and see all the things, or if they would be distracted [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3582.6s)]
*  by this image that they had seen for so many years that was now so clearly. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3586.44s)]
*  In a different, you know, a different age demographic, but you were out there. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3593.32s)]
*  It wasn't like people hadn't seen you in seven years, right? [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3598.76s)]
*  Not much, man. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3602.8s)]
*  I I'd been out there a bit. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3603.84s)]
*  I'd been on Steven's show a bit, but I really don't, you know, James will [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3605.28s)]
*  tell you, I don't like to do shit. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3610.44s)]
*  I like to be home. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3612.44s)]
*  And not only will he tell you it, it drives him crazy. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3613.92s)]
*  He just feels like you're costing him money constantly. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3617.36s)]
*  It's like four more country clubs. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3622.04s)]
*  He could belong to. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3623.52s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3624.36s)]
*  That's so funny. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3625.44s)]
*  Listen, I put enough, I put enough, uh, distance on his pool that I feel very [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3626.56s)]
*  comfortable with the choices. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3631.6s)]
*  Do you realize what John could do? [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3632.6s)]
*  Do you realize if he just committed for one year, what we could do? [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3634.2000000000003s)]
*  He'll tell you the worst ones are the, uh, uh, advertisements, the commercials [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3639.88s)]
*  people would come with and he'd be like, what? [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3643.84s)]
*  That you don't understand. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3646.08s)]
*  This is, they don't make deals like this. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3647.08s)]
*  And I'd be like, I don't care. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3649.24s)]
*  I don't, I don't use that product. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3650.7599999999998s)]
*  He just wants enough that, uh, he can brag about how much he helped you. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3654.32s)]
*  He has, and the great deals, the great deals that he gets, all he wants to do [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3659.84s)]
*  is brag about the deal he got. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3663.56s)]
*  The best at what he does of anybody I've ever seen. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3664.88s)]
*  And part of it is he's so, he doesn't play games. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3668.88s)]
*  There's no bull. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3673.0s)]
*  Like he's just like, this is what we're doing. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3673.84s)]
*  This he doesn't try and trick people. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3677.48s)]
*  He doesn't strategize around it. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3679.4s)]
*  He doesn't try and take shortcuts. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3681.36s)]
*  He just does his fucking job in a straightforward, like clear cut, honest [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3683.4s)]
*  manner, and the people that appreciate that are great to do business with. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3688.2000000000003s)]
*  And the people that don't appreciate that are people you wouldn't want to do [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3692.2s)]
*  business with in the first place. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3695.3199999999997s)]
*  Cause there are, uh, as, as you have probably figured out by now, a shit ton [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3696.68s)]
*  of liars in this business on every level. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3701.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3704.96s)]
*  And sadly I have to deal with them on the executive side now and it's, it's not great. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3705.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3709.56s)]
*  No, that part of it is absolutely. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3710.88s)]
*  I'm sure not what you got into. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3712.68s)]
*  What's the part of this that you love the best? [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3713.92s)]
*  I think it's elevating people who have something that it could go to another level [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3715.88s)]
*  and then watching it happen, I think is the most fun part, which I think you've [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3723.28s)]
*  had an incredible amount of experience with too. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3726.12s)]
*  Like you think of the, it's pretty good. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3728.1600000000003s)]
*  The daily show tree when you watch somebody that, and you, and you can watch [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3730.04s)]
*  them go from here to here. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3733.52s)]
*  And if you have like a tiny part of that, I think that's the best part. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3734.6800000000003s)]
*  Watching people level up, whether as writers or the executive producer of the show. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3738.2000000000003s)]
*  Jen flans who's the executive producer show who like that show wouldn't happen [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3744.04s)]
*  without her. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3748.04s)]
*  If you're looking at the special sauce, like she is, she's the keeper of the [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3748.68s)]
*  formula to the crusty crab. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3755.48s)]
*  Like she knows what's up. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3757.12s)]
*  She was a PA when I got there in 1999, she was, she was in the building before I was. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3759.32s)]
*  She was a production assistant and you just watch, she was just killer, just [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3765.64s)]
*  smartest shit. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3769.7599999999998s)]
*  And like, you just watched her get better and better and better and level up and [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3770.2799999999997s)]
*  level up and, you know, making her executive producer, uh, was the, one of [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3774.08s)]
*  the easiest decisions in my life. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3778.9599999999996s)]
*  Like it just easy. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3781.0s)]
*  Um, when that first show you did back, you did all the Biden stuff and people were [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3783.8399999999997s)]
*  surprised that that was your first thing and it immediately became polarizing. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3788.2s)]
*  And then we look back and it's like, all right, even the title of the show, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3792.3199999999997s)]
*  even the time was right for that show. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3798.84s)]
*  People were mad. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3800.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3802.2s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3803.88s)]
*  Why is he doing this? [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3804.52s)]
*  Why is he, why is he bringing all this up? [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3805.68s)]
*  Called me a threat to democracy. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3808.36s)]
*  There was a while there was like you and Charlemagne and I don't think anybody [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3812.32s)]
*  else was saying anything. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3815.52s)]
*  Oh, Charlemagne. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3816.72s)]
*  So I love listening to him. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3817.4s)]
*  He just, he just fucking, he just cuts through it. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3819.44s)]
*  Um, but it's just been crazy to watch the last year and especially you did your [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3822.08s)]
*  show on Monday about Jake Tapper's book when he's on TV the whole time, not [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3826.16s)]
*  saying anything and then it's like, I've got some news. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3831.44s)]
*  I thought that was, uh, you know, that's, that's why your show, I think as [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3833.48s)]
*  long as you want to do it, it's so essential because you're just taking [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3837.7599999999998s)]
*  these little things that are happening and then tweaking them and presenting [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3840.6s)]
*  them in a way where you're like, oh yeah, that's kind of fucked up. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3844.6s)]
*  Well, I think the process is it continues to be sort of what it always was, which [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3847.36s)]
*  is it's not a reexamination of news. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3851.08s)]
*  It's really a kind of reexamination of the most, what you think are the most [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3854.12s)]
*  absurd aspects of these institutions that we like to me, that first Biden [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3859.96s)]
*  bit we did was that, like I just, I was watching this with a sense of like, am [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3866.6s)]
*  I insane? [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3874.32s)]
*  Like the idea that we're not looking at this as that, you know, we are supposedly [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3876.32s)]
*  in the most dangerous election of our lifetime, the only way we will fend off [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3882.88s)]
*  forever fascism and we're not going to put our best foot forward and we're going [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3887.92s)]
*  to all pretend that, that this guy who defined did a good job, but like this [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3892.56s)]
*  ain't fucking, you know, peewee football. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3901.2400000000002s)]
*  Like this is the presidency and it just seemed utterly absurd to me. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3904.44s)]
*  And then I remember we had come back. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3911.44s)]
*  It was right after the super bowl, I think. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3913.08s)]
*  And traditionally, I think during the super bowl, the president has an [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3915.56s)]
*  opportunity to address, you know, do an interview in the middle. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3919.2799999999997s)]
*  So this is a run up to the election. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3922.7999999999997s)]
*  You have a chance to do an interview and get to, and they decided not to do it, [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3924.16s)]
*  but rather put out tick tocks of him, like eating chocolate chip cookies. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3928.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3934.3199999999997s)]
*  And it seems like a red flag. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3935.08s)]
*  And so we ran a big montage of everybody saying the idea that he's too old is [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3936.76s)]
*  ridiculous. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3941.5600000000004s)]
*  He's the sharpest guy you don't know. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3942.2000000000003s)]
*  I think it was, you don't understand if you were in the meetings, you would [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3944.0800000000004s)]
*  see someone at the top of their game sharp as attack sharp as attack. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3947.8s)]
*  And the, and the joke was, Ooh, has anyone thought to film that? [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3951.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3955.5200000000004s)]
*  Cause the shit we're seeing does not engender. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3955.7200000000003s)]
*  Cause what happened with buying and this sort of brings it around to comedy. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3958.5200000000004s)]
*  The worst thing a comic can be for an audience is fragile. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3962.2s)]
*  Like if you're in the audience and you're worried about the comic, not in a mean [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3967.68s)]
*  way, like in a way of like, I don't think this guy's very good. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3972.16s)]
*  This is going to be rough. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3977.7999999999997s)]
*  And he's like stumbling. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3978.8399999999997s)]
*  The spell is gone. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3980.7999999999997s)]
*  It's a fragile spell. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3981.9599999999996s)]
*  And if that's the way you're viewing the president and that is the way when [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3984.3999999999996s)]
*  people are watching the president, they're like, Oh, I'm going to be the [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3987.2s)]
*  president. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3990.28s)]
*  And that is the way when you couldn't deny that when you watched him, there [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3990.6400000000003s)]
*  was trepidation that he wouldn't get through it and he would fuck it up. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=3994.84s)]
*  Well, the other piece of it was, it was the private conversations we're all [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4000.0800000000004s)]
*  having about it. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4003.5600000000004s)]
*  Weren't being captured in public conversations. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4004.6400000000003s)]
*  And that's always when, you know, something is off. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4006.92s)]
*  Cause all the conversations I was having, I was like, what the fuck's going on? [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4010.1200000000003s)]
*  And he seems seeing Parkinson's what's happening. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4013.48s)]
*  And that was two years. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4016.7200000000003s)]
*  Those conversations were taking place. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4018.2799999999997s)]
*  Everywhere except on the news where they're supposed to take place. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4021.4799999999996s)]
*  And I think, you know, I've always said the truest part of CNN or MSNBC, the [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4026.4399999999996s)]
*  truest part of the broadcast is in their green room. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4034.08s)]
*  If you go to the green room of those 24 hours, you'll hear the truth. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4037.52s)]
*  You'll hear people that are involved in politics, that are politicians, that are [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4041.12s)]
*  consultants, that are journalists, that are analysts. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4045.6s)]
*  That's where they tell the truth. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4048.7200000000003s)]
*  Can you believe this fucking guy? [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4050.04s)]
*  There's no way he makes it through. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4051.52s)]
*  He can't even get up that if we do this, it's a disaster on the cameras on red [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4053.0s)]
*  lights on, you know, I don't, he's able to get through certain legislation. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4058.8s)]
*  I, I wouldn't say that it's a detriment. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4063.2400000000002s)]
*  I think it's perhaps it's his experience that could help. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4066.44s)]
*  But if you go in that green room, that's the truth. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4069.36s)]
*  And our show has always hopefully been a kind of presentation of the absurdity [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4071.16s)]
*  between what's going on in the green room and what's going, what they're putting [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4078.08s)]
*  out as the official version and how those different. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4082.72s)]
*  Well, ironically, that also happens in sports. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4087.3599999999997s)]
*  Cause I even remember, yeah, I remember the first year I did NBA countdown and [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4090.72s)]
*  magic was on the show and we'd be in the green room talking about stuff to talk [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4094.7599999999998s)]
*  about in the show and half of the thing was trying to get magic to say the stuff [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4097.92s)]
*  he said in the green room on TV, but that red light, oh yeah, that red light really [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4103.2s)]
*  scares, there's just repercussions with every sentence you say, especially if [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4108.04s)]
*  you're ad libbing on camera or you're, you know, you're talking for 30 straight [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4112.6s)]
*  seconds and the words are coming out. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4116.36s)]
*  Sometimes you can't control where the words are going and you're trying to make [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4118.88s)]
*  a point and it's either too hard and you end up, you end up kind of receding and [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4121.84s)]
*  being more careful. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4126.8s)]
*  And that's, yeah, as long as you know, shifts in tone, I don't mind. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4127.84s)]
*  It's shifts in absolutes that I always mind. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4131.4400000000005s)]
*  And I think, like I've always said to the people at the Delish, I go look around [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4135.0s)]
*  this room, like when you leave here, these will be your only remaining friends. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4139.64s)]
*  Like you can't look at it. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4144.360000000001s)]
*  Like, yeah, I need to maintain access. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4145.68s)]
*  And I firmly believe that if you stick to what you think is true and [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4150.8s)]
*  defensible, you'll be okay. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4156.04s)]
*  We all fuck up. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4157.8s)]
*  You know, we all say something that's intemperate or like, maybe didn't come out [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4159.88s)]
*  the way you want it to. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4164.16s)]
*  And when you own that stuff, when you need to, you should. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4164.88s)]
*  But boy, when we put on this and you and I are wrestling fans, when you put on [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4168.96s)]
*  this K-Fabe, and now I'm starting to feel like the whole thing is K-Fabe. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4174.24s)]
*  The whole thing is, is, you know, we were talking about it on the show. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4180.4s)]
*  It used to be the, it's not the crime. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4184.24s)]
*  It's the cover up. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4185.92s)]
*  I feel like the whole thing is cover up now. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4186.52s)]
*  No matter who's out there. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4189.32s)]
*  You're talking about authenticity, which I think feels in 2025 with the single [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4190.28s)]
*  most important word, right? [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4194.92s)]
*  It's, they think they still think of authenticity as a strategy, which is [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4197.92s)]
*  the antithesis of authenticity. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4201.16s)]
*  But that's, I think what shifting is authenticity, just in the purest form [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4202.6s)]
*  is now becoming the thing you want. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4207.24s)]
*  Cause we see this with athletes and celebrities, and I think social [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4209.28s)]
*  media has a big part of this. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4212.68s)]
*  They're presenting this version of themselves or this version of what they [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4213.88s)]
*  should say, how they should act for the public and you don't kind of really [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4217.4400000000005s)]
*  know what's behind it. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4222.04s)]
*  And then over and over again, we find out, Oh, that person was a maniac or, [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4222.96s)]
*  Oh, that person got caught, you know, behind the scenes saying this when they [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4226.92s)]
*  actually said this in public. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4231.52s)]
*  And I think a lot of the ways they did. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4232.64s)]
*  Is that intentional? [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4234.8s)]
*  Is that for athletes? [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4236.36s)]
*  Do they have people kind of that, that are working with them on that to make [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4238.04s)]
*  it that way? [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4243.64s)]
*  I actually think the decision was that was kind of the turning point. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4244.240000000001s)]
*  And then there's social media pieces too, but the decision went so bad for Lebron [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4247.8s)]
*  and was such a bad kind of move. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4252.280000000001s)]
*  And it's kind of just such a bad unforced error that I think it made, it [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4255.88s)]

*  Right. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4264.56s)]
*  Do you, do you have to think about all the ramifications, good and bad. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4265.400000000001s)]
*  And then that leads to this weird social media personas. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4268.64s)]
*  Everybody has now that you've no idea. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4271.36s)]
*  You see somebody, if you look at it and go, well, geez, if somebody who is as [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4273.5599999999995s)]
*  great as Lebron can face a backlash, I guess what chance do I have? [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4277.36s)]
*  I mean, Jordan was very, you know, famously was like, I'm staying out of the fray [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4284.32s)]
*  and, you know, but then you see the 30 for thirties and, you know, uh, the last [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4289.92s)]
*  dance and all that. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4294.719999999999s)]
*  And you're like, Ooh, [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4295.4s)]
*  the gambling stuff with him was way worse than I think people remember. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4297.24s)]
*  I mean, he's, he's giving interviews on the pregame show. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4300.28s)]
*  Like I do not have a gambling problem. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4303.599999999999s)]
*  It's like watching politicians. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4305.36s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4307.08s)]
*  Um, but now I still think there's some really, I think we have some athletes [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4307.599999999999s)]
*  now that feel authentic to me, um, in everything they do and you kind of know [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4312.24s)]
*  who they are, we don't have to do the list, but there's, and then there's some [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4317.84s)]
*  people that still feel like they're trying to present some version of themselves [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4321.28s)]
*  that they think we want versus whatever it actually is, you know, and it's, and [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4325.36s)]
*  they get called out for it. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4330.04s)]
*  I think, you know, there's that, right. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4331.12s)]
*  You know, there's always, you know, you know, it's interesting. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4333.04s)]
*  Tatum faces that a lot, which I think is you sort of, you look at a guy who's [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4336.96s)]
*  just so good and won a world championship, but even in the midst of winning a world [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4341.52s)]
*  championship, people were like, that's the wrong way to say, you know, what he [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4346.2s)]
*  just said mimics what Kobe just, you know, and I thought that was so. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4352.6s)]
*  Fascinating that here he was at the peak of this and he clearly like with his [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4358.08s)]
*  boy, which like, you're just like, oh my God, this is a moment's moment, like [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4362.92s)]
*  this, and then you look online and people are just, fuck that guy he's doing. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4367.16s)]
*  That's that's not real. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4373.16s)]
*  And you just think, oh boy, the other thing that I forget, the other piece of [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4374.84s)]
*  it is we face relentless. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4378.92s)]
*  We live in a, a culture of relentless comment. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4383.08s)]
*  Relentless commentary and those that are in sports or entertainment or politics. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4385.88s)]
*  You know, those relentless comments as they exist in the ether, but I think [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4395.12s)]
*  they ultimately begin to have a kind of molecular weight to them as well. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4399.52s)]
*  That the heaviness and you carry that. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4404.88s)]
*  You carry that around as a little bit of extra weight to them. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4410.8s)]
*  As you're going through this other journey, that's really hard to do in the first place. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4413.88s)]
*  And I do think it's weighed on them. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4418.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4420.32s)]
*  If you're looking for it, how do you know the comments, but people say like, I [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4420.64s)]
*  don't go in the comments, that's nonsense. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4423.92s)]
*  You know, I don't, I don't check that stuff. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4425.96s)]
*  Yes, you do. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4427.68s)]
*  It's like saying it's like being, it's like being in a comedy club, right? [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4429.28s)]
*  And whenever you're in a comedy club and you're doing a show, there's going to be [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4434.8s)]
*  a table of people that like, aren't having it, just not feeling it. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4437.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4440.4400000000005s)]
*  Social media is then you have to ride home with that table in the cab and, [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4440.72s)]
*  and hear them talk their shit. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4446.12s)]
*  But to suggest that like, I don't listen to it. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4448.56s)]
*  Like people are calling your name. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4451.72s)]
*  You're not going to go, what? [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4453.6s)]
*  Like, of course, you know about it. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4455.12s)]
*  How can you not? [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4457.240000000001s)]
*  Well, there's never saying knowing about it and then obsessing over it. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4458.52s)]
*  Oh, that's yes. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4462.12s)]
*  No question. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4463.400000000001s)]
*  You have to learn how to, I try to, I try to, I try to, I try to, I try to [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4464.400000000001s)]
*  avoid it as much of it as I possibly can. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4467.84s)]
*  Cause I think it's, I think it's damaging. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4470.2s)]
*  It's, it starts putting, you know, it's like being, it's like being in a room in [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4472.4800000000005s)]
*  high school and you hear people in the bathroom talking about you, right? [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4476.96s)]
*  Are you just going to stay there and be like, Oh cool. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4480.92s)]
*  I hope all five of these people just rip me apart for the next 10 minutes. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4482.76s)]
*  I'll just stay here. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4486.320000000001s)]
*  Or do you just kind of be like, all right, that's kind of fucked up. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4487.52s)]
*  Were there, I remember when I was checking out the show, I was like, [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4490.76s)]
*  I remember when I was just leaving the show is when like the internet was [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4496.4400000000005s)]
*  kind of coming to bear, like, [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4501.68s)]
*  well, we talked about that. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4504.320000000001s)]
*  Cause I remember talking to you the end of 2015 and you left and it reminded [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4505.6s)]
*  me of my dad retired from being a superintendent in 2009. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4511.160000000001s)]
*  And one of the reasons was cause the phones were coming and social [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4514.96s)]
*  media was coming and he's like, I gotta get out. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4517.72s)]
*  I don't know where this is going. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4520.64s)]
*  And I don't want to be in charge when this heads to where I think it's going. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4522.04s)]
*  And that was kind of your mentality when you left the daily show. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4525.4s)]
*  Originally you were like, I see where this is going and I don't like it. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4528.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4531.44s)]
*  It stole, I think a lot of the joy of it to some extent, but also the [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4531.879999999999s)]
*  relentlessness of the news cycle and the redundancy of the news cycle. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4537.2s)]
*  I sort of got to a point where I didn't know how to creatively. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4542.44s)]
*  Elevate the show anymore. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4548.28s)]
*  I just didn't feel like I had the ability to do that. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4549.36s)]
*  And I felt myself checking out. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4552.679999999999s)]
*  To the extent that it wasn't fair. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4555.599999999999s)]
*  You can't, you shouldn't just stay in a place because you can, [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4559.36s)]
*  because they'll let you, you know, you don't want to just coast combining [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4563.36s)]
*  that with my kids were at that age where. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4568.16s)]
*  Like I needed to be there. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4571.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, they were seven, eight, nine years old. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4574.16s)]
*  Like I needed to be there in a more, uh, explicit way than I had been able to [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4576.0s)]
*  throughout the run of the show. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4584.24s)]
*  So all those things kind of coalesced into a very clear feeling of. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4586.24s)]
*  You kind of know when it's time. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4593.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4594.36s)]
*  This is, this is the right move. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4595.08s)]
*  I've always said one of the best decisions I ever made was accepting the job. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4596.36s)]
*  And one of the other best decisions I ever made was when I left, because I'll [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4599.76s)]
*  never, I will never, I would never have been able to get those years back. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4605.04s)]
*  Just even though like driving them home from school every day, and you just [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4610.120000000001s)]
*  hear shit you wouldn't hear, I was there at the crying times before crying [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4615.52s)]
*  because they didn't want to go to school and crying because they didn't want to [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4621.160000000001s)]
*  go to bed, those were the only two times I got to see anybody. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4623.68s)]
*  So having that experience broadened out like. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4627.4800000000005s)]
*  Priceless, you know, [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4634.72s)]
*  but then you come back. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4636.84s)]
*  And now you're in a weird spot. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4638.72s)]
*  They go to college and I'm like, [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4639.92s)]
*  you find out, Oh, my kid's 15 now. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4642.52s)]
*  He barely wants to hang out with me. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4644.36s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4646.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4647.84s)]
*  Oh, all right. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4648.36s)]
*  I guess, I guess I'm just an ATM machine now. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4649.16s)]
*  And then occasionally we have dinner. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4651.4s)]
*  That's so far. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4652.48s)]
*  We're saying that to Paul Reddy was on the show. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4653.12s)]
*  I was like, you know, I think I made a mistake when I was a little younger [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4654.6s)]
*  in that I didn't make any friends. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4658.96s)]
*  And so when my son and my daughter went off to college, I was like, huh, Hey [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4660.8s)]
*  honey, you want to, you want to watch a game and eat a sandwich? [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4665.32s)]
*  Like, no. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4668.0s)]
*  Do John Ham show and Apple jump in a couple of episodes. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4668.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4673.2s)]
*  But you're in a spot now where I feel like you could do Monday and Thursday [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4674.04s)]
*  and probably, but, but I'm just saying, I'm in a spot now until, uh, you know, [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4678.16s)]
*  the company is bought out by people that don't want anything to do with the [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4685.4s)]
*  daily show and then who the fuck knows what's going to happen. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4687.96s)]
*  I mean, look what they're doing now. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4690.12s)]
*  That's 60 minutes and CBS news and everything. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4691.04s)]
*  I was going to ask you about that. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4693.56s)]
*  This, it feels like we're in. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4694.72s)]
*  We're in an area now that we've never been in, in my lifetime. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4697.08s)]
*  Oh, it's insane. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4700.879999999999s)]
*  People are just saying that was in, that was like the NFL and five other things [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4702.08s)]
*  in my life that I just felt like would go on for the entire time until I die. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4707.4s)]
*  And now I wonder if it's going to exist. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4710.96s)]
*  Wonder if it's going to exist because an interview, they, they aired an edited [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4713.639999999999s)]
*  interview, which is how all interviews air. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4718.48s)]
*  Now you can make, uh, comments about, well, I think I didn't like the way they [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4721.0s)]
*  edited it in the way that oftentimes people don't like the way they edited it. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4726.0s)]
*  But it certainly doesn't rise to the level of, uh, libel slander or whatever [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4729.64s)]
*  the fuck else they think they're doing with a $2 billion, uh, lawsuit. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4736.96s)]
*  It's a purely subjective, uh, editorial decision that are made every day, [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4742.92s)]
*  including on Fox news and, uh, OAN or whatever it is that Trump feels like. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4748.44s)]
*  But what you're seeing now is all must pay tribute to the king. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4754.360000000001s)]
*  And the price of that, uh, the price of peace is different. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4761.0s)]
*  You know, ABC had to pay 15 million, uh, Bezos had to pay 40 million [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4766.04s)]
*  for a documentary on Melania. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4771.56s)]
*  Uh, Zuckerberg had to pay. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4773.72s)]
*  They just pay trip. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4775.64s)]
*  They just put money into the pot so that hopefully they don't get, they're paying [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4776.52s)]
*  like, what does that remind you of? [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4784.400000000001s)]
*  Michael, protection money, right? [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4786.8s)]
*  It's protection money. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4789.2s)]
*  So ultimately at the end of this, does Trump burn our fucking country [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4790.08s)]
*  down for insurance money? [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4793.4800000000005s)]
*  Like where are we headed? [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4794.68s)]
*  But the reason why the guy from 60 minutes and the reason why the head of CBS news [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4798.24s)]
*  left is it's not even about the money, which I think is they've said is upwards [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4803.12s)]
*  of like 50 million, imagine paying $50 million for fucking nothing. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4808.4800000000005s)]
*  Just to get somebody to approve a merger, a it's bribery, but B the reason they all [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4813.92s)]
*  left is part of the deal is they have to apologize. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4820.68s)]
*  And in that moment, these people who have built careers on their excellence and [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4825.8s)]
*  their integrity had to look and go like, all right, well, I hope I've done well [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4831.6s)]
*  enough that I can weather this, but there's no fucking way that I'm going [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4837.2s)]
*  to apologize for doing my job the way it's supposed to be done just because [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4843.24s)]
*  this one guy is offended by it. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4848.639999999999s)]
*  And ultimately what an awful precedent that these media companies have set. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4853.36s)]
*  But, you know, now, now he'll go after Harvard and Comcast or whatever the hell [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4862.679999999999s)]
*  else he does because a policy of appeasement always leads to more conquest. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4870.5599999999995s)]
*  It's tragic. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4877.16s)]
*  And there's been a bunch of soul searching on the other side for the last year [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4879.719999999999s)]
*  on what's about the Democrat liberal side on what did we do wrong? [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4885.08s)]
*  How did we get this? [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4889.839999999999s)]
*  How do we fix this? [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4892.639999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4894.36s)]
*  That's been, which has honestly resembled sports. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4895.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, you think it's like a, did they fire the coach and then they're going to [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4899.280000000001s)]
*  bring somebody where it's like, we lost them the second round. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4903.280000000001s)]
*  What happened? [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4905.88s)]
*  What do we do now? [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4906.64s)]
*  What is it? [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4907.64s)]
*  Our drafts is our best. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4908.400000000001s)]
*  And the way that, uh, that the liberal Democrat side has approached it. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4910.360000000001s)]
*  It's almost like we have to blow this up and start over and we have to rethink our. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4916.0s)]
*  And I don't, I don't, I don't feel like it's a six month fix. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4920.72s)]
*  Um, because a lot of the same issues are on that side with, you know, [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4925.4800000000005s)]
*  authenticity, honesty, um, the same kind of media machine. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4929.120000000001s)]
*  Set the stage for it. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4933.52s)]
*  The corruption of the system sets the stage for these kinds of disruptions. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4934.56s)]
*  Yes. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4939.84s)]
*  Like the, I'm convinced that the Iraq war and the way it was prosecuted and the [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4940.400000000001s)]
*  fact that Bush and the Republican, you know, that the establishment Republicans [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4946.88s)]
*  that, that led that charge, that is what opened the opportunity in the door for [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4953.08s)]
*  Donald Trump to demolish and take over the husk of that party. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4960.16s)]
*  They had so destroyed their credibility that for somebody to come in with a new [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4967.12s)]
*  idea, take a hold of that apparatus and turn it on its head was exactly that. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4971.84s)]
*  That was, that was set. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4981.92s)]
*  The ground was set because of the actions of, uh, in Iraq and all those other things. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4985.16s)]
*  This and what happened with Biden and everything else will set the stage for [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4991.68s)]
*  a similar opportunity in the democratic party, whether or not someone is able to [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=4996.400000000001s)]
*  grab that apparatus and build something powerful and effective out of it will be [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5003.2s)]
*  the real trick. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5008.24s)]
*  And we might not even know who that would be, but certainly the opportunity [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5008.88s)]
*  right now is there because the status quo, right? [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5014.0s)]
*  Of that party is tainted. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5017.68s)]
*  Everybody's got it on them. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5021.32s)]
*  Almost everybody, which means that it really opens the door for somebody to walk [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5023.76s)]
*  in and go, I'll take your infrastructure, but the rest of you motherfuckers have to [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5029.28s)]
*  go. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5033.2s)]
*  Or you have to get in line and this is the new way that we pursue the vision for [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5034.5599999999995s)]
*  whatever the democratic party is going to be. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5040.8s)]
*  Or you need one or two great people, which is another like, or, or one or two, [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5043.64s)]
*  not so great people who just, I mean, I wouldn't suggest that, you know, Trump is [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5048.64s)]
*  a great person, but he was a person with a vision. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5053.84s)]
*  And when things are in disrepair, vision goes a long way, vision and will. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5057.360000000001s)]
*  And I think it's entirely possible. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5064.76s)]
*  And I think it's actually the opportunity is there. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5067.64s)]
*  I just hope that they seize it in the right way and don't just paper over, [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5073.84s)]
*  which is what you tend to think they're going to do. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5078.52s)]
*  We have two years here to figure it out. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5081.6s)]
*  Yeah, not you, but just what? [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5084.320000000001s)]
*  Just the country. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5087.96s)]
*  It's funny. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5089.8s)]
*  My friend, Ben Latham was over last night who works, who works for the ringer. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5090.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5093.72s)]
*  And we were hanging out in the kitchen, actually watching the Knicks game. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5093.96s)]
*  And he was asking my son about what are you studying in history? [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5097.8s)]
*  And he was talking about the fifties and sixties and some of the things he's [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5101.68s)]
*  learning. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5104.76s)]
*  We were talking about the sixties, which is one of those weird kitchen [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5105.08s)]
*  conversations when we're talking about all the great people in the sixties. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5107.8s)]
*  And then how many of them were, were murdered or in the case of like [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5111.92s)]
*  Muhammad Ali, they wouldn't let him box for five years and all the ways we got [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5116.5599999999995s)]
*  fucked up, but we just had this unusual collection of awesome, interesting, one [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5120.36s)]
*  of one people all at the same time, for whatever reason. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5126.16s)]
*  That's right. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5129.44s)]
*  And I wonder, can that happen again in the 2020s or in the 2030s? [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5130.5199999999995s)]
*  Is that even possible anymore? [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5136.44s)]
*  Where we would just have this, this confluence of, Oh shit. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5138.44s)]
*  Hey, we have this person and this person and this person, maybe we're [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5142.84s)]
*  in good hands again. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5146.12s)]
*  I mean, I think circumstance dictates the people that, that rise to those [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5147.96s)]
*  challenges and I absolutely think, you know, opportunity almost never goes, [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5152.24s)]
*  uh, wasted. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5160.36s)]
*  Like I think, I think someone always steps up and steps in, maybe not to the [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5162.639999999999s)]
*  extent that we'd want it to, or maybe on the other side, but I always remain [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5167.56s)]
*  optimistic because there's too many, look on an individual basis, there's [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5173.4800000000005s)]
*  just too many fucking good people. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5178.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5180.280000000001s)]
*  And, and, uh, I don't think these things all go in sort of cycles and those [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5181.04s)]
*  cycles change. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5188.320000000001s)]
*  And as they say, the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5189.360000000001s)]
*  justice, but when people don't say a whole lot is, but it doesn't bend by itself. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5192.360000000001s)]
*  And there's a whole bunch of people trying to bend it the other way. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5196.599999999999s)]
*  So those things are, are necessary, but I think you also have kind of, you have [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5199.16s)]

*  That's a bump like pastor 20s. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5355.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm not taking it. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5357.32s)]

*  long time, maybe since I've been really paying attention, except in the seventies. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5538.200000000001s)]
*  And what I also like about them is they're good dudes. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5545.12s)]
*  Like, yeah, they're just easy to root for. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5548.96s)]
*  They're hard work and there's not a lot of like, look at me shit. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5553.44s)]
*  Like they're really, they're a fun, incredible group. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5557.88s)]
*  This has been a ride that like you dream about a little bit. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5561.84s)]
*  It'd be great to get to the finals, but man, Indiana's wagon, like it, they're [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5565.6s)]
*  going, it's going to be hard. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5569.6s)]
*  Um, but you know, they're not out of it. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5571.64s)]
*  I don't, I don't view it like I viewed the Celtic series. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5575.6s)]
*  I view it like we could be in every game, but then, you know, look, what was it? [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5578.5599999999995s)]
*  138 135 and before overtime, even like we're playing the pacer style right now. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5582.36s)]
*  And I don't know if we can survive that. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5589.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5591.16s)]
*  I don't know if we can survive that. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5591.48s)]
*  What do you think 1993 Mike and the mad dog would have said about that loss last [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5593.08s)]
*  night? [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5597.08s)]
*  Mike, [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5598.4s)]
*  Mike, waste the time. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5601.44s)]
*  These guys are the dog dog dog. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5603.12s)]
*  That is the most humongous loss the Knicks have ever had. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5606.16s)]
*  Dog. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5609.56s)]
*  They're never going to, you're never going to see a loss like that again. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5610.2s)]
*  That in the garden, the garden, I've been going to the garden since 1908. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5612.64s)]
*  I saw, uh, I saw, uh, Tony fight Dempsey. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5617.56s)]
*  I saw Tony fight Dempsey in the garden 19 and that was the only time I ever [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5622.4800000000005s)]
*  thought, uh, same, same kind of thing. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5625.96s)]
*  Dogs. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5627.76s)]
*  You, you must've listened to that back in the day all the time, right? [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5631.72s)]
*  Like in the dark. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5634.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5636.08s)]
*  Was anything better than when they did the Oscars? [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5636.6s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5640.6s)]
*  Not Mike. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5641.16s)]
*  Like ever, ever. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5641.64s)]
*  That was to me, that's that created podcasting. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5643.0s)]
*  Mike and the mad dog decided they were going to weigh in. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5645.6s)]
*  I feel like they created it when they weighed in on like the 94 Oscars or the [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5648.16s)]
*  Emmys. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5651.88s)]
*  I was like, this is just the model for something down the road. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5652.28s)]
*  It is stunning. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5655.52s)]
*  How influential they were. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5657.56s)]
*  And are, and are through broadcasting more dog now. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5661.6s)]
*  I think Francesca doesn't do a ton. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5665.24s)]
*  I feel like a lot of the people that have huge platforms now, and I include myself, [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5667.4s)]
*  were like massively influenced by that specific show because of the interplay [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5671.88s)]
*  back and forth with those guys. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5676.8s)]
*  Yes. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5678.639999999999s)]
*  Is really what podcast became. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5679.04s)]
*  The first take and all those other ones, I think are in many ways. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5681.24s)]
*  Sons of those shows. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5684.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5685.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5687.04s)]
*  Those guys were, and when they came on the air, the fan was nascent. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5687.5599999999995s)]
*  Like it wasn't as big a deal yet. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5692.12s)]
*  Stevie Summers, you know, at night doing all his stuff and dog and Francesca and [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5694.2s)]
*  like, it lit up sports in a way that, you know, for New Yorkers was like this, you [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5699.04s)]
*  know, and now everybody does kind of their impression of that. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5706.4s)]
*  But, uh, but it's amazing. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5710.0s)]
*  And to see, especially dog, like still going strong. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5713.48s)]
*  It's kind of great. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5717.08s)]
*  No, he's a long career. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5718.28s)]
*  And with, with some chapters to it too. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5721.2s)]
*  Well, now the fan, you still listen to the fan. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5723.12s)]
*  It, it seems like some of it is a little performative because the clips are really [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5725.16s)]
*  funny. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5729.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5729.84s)]
*  We need it also has to be, you know, two bald guys just like absolutely losing [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5730.32s)]
*  their mind over the protection behind Aaron judge or what that wants. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5734.12s)]
*  Soto seems unhappy. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5737.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5739.04s)]
*  And the problem I have now sometimes with the fan is a lot of the voices sound the [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5739.96s)]
*  same. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5745.5599999999995s)]
*  Like the nice thing about dog and Francesca is they were like hauling oats. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5746.0s)]
*  Like one guy saying hi blues and the other guy and every now and again, we're [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5750.879999999999s)]
*  thinking, so that treble and bass really work. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5754.32s)]
*  Now you get shows that are like treble, treble, and it's, you don't know who's [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5757.759999999999s)]
*  talking and they're all at the same pitch. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5762.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5765.2s)]
*  And it's just kind of cacophony. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5765.36s)]
*  And like you say, pretty performative, pretty obviously takes with like kind of [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5768.919999999999s)]
*  holes in them. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5774.5599999999995s)]
*  Um, still fun to listen to, but. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5776.08s)]
*  You know, we're also old heads. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5778.92s)]
*  We're old heads. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5780.76s)]
*  New York radio will never die. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5781.64s)]
*  The, the, um, the one thing with, um, I'm blanking on the, what's the guy's name? [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5783.88s)]
*  Um, dog was on when he goes on first take and he does basically national version [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5790.28s)]
*  of the dog. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5798.68s)]
*  That was the part I never thought he would be able to navigate the way he has. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5799.4s)]
*  I always felt like, I always felt like it was, that was a New York show with [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5803.84s)]
*  New York people. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5807.2s)]
*  And I never thought he's such a character become a national treasure. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5808.8s)]
*  Cause I think he's great. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5811.76s)]
*  He's so legitimately funny that I think that translates through it and the way [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5813.08s)]
*  that he just runs through, you know, the whole like, I got to take a gummy, [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5819.48s)]
*  I take a gummy, I'm going to sit down. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5823.48s)]
*  I'm going to take a gummy and watch it. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5825.4s)]
*  I'm going to watch the Yankees. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5827.679999999999s)]
*  You know, he just, he, he legitimately is just an entertaining personality. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5829.32s)]
*  One of the things I learned from that show was how completely seriously they [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5834.36s)]
*  took everything. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5839.4s)]
*  Like they would talk about tennis and dog would have these passion opinions [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5840.24s)]
*  about like Monica sell us. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5845.04s)]
*  It might, I think she may be the best woman's play ever. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5847.72s)]
*  Like right now. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5851.6s)]
*  And it just, it just would go all in and be like, wow, this is an incredible, [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5853.0s)]
*  incredible take. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5858.04s)]
*  No, they were, they were the hot takes, but the nice part about them is they [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5859.08s)]
*  were a hot take in a sea of like lukewarm water. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5862.88s)]
*  So it's so brutal. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5868.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5870.400000000001s)]
*  It's so stood out for just it's, as we said earlier, like there was an authenticity [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5870.68s)]
*  to it, these two guys, uh, and, and just, it was brilliant. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5876.4400000000005s)]
*  PCI was another one like that. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5883.28s)]
*  I feel like those, if you're talking about podcasting, the form, those two, [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5884.72s)]
*  the interplay and the chemistry is what matters. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5889.32s)]
*  I've always loved it. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5891.84s)]
*  Corn, you know, those guys, you know, and again, like sometimes duos really [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5892.68s)]
*  are more than the sum of their parts. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5899.6s)]
*  Like those guys are great on their own, but like dog and friends as it were. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5901.12s)]
*  Together. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5905.08s)]
*  It was just, it was magic. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5907.8s)]
*  You know, it's like that Larry David and doc reverse would have a great talk. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5911.240000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5914.0s)]
*  I'm telling you, they have it. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5916.16s)]
*  The combo of those guys. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5918.0s)]
*  It's like a fascinating David is doing dog. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5919.56s)]
*  He's doing dog. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5923.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5925.280000000001s)]

*  She's the greatest. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5927.8s)]
*  She's the best. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5930.12s)]
*  What is doing? [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5931.0s)]
*  What are they doing? [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5932.64s)]
*  Towns drive the lane. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5933.76s)]
*  You're bigger than he is. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5935.16s)]
*  By the way, when towns was posting up on true holiday, what, why would the [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5936.4800000000005s)]
*  Celtics put true holiday on towns? [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5941.76s)]
*  I think like people try to Jedi mind trick towns with small people hoping [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5944.12s)]
*  he'll elbow them in the face or bowl them over. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5949.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5951.4800000000005s)]
*  I was just like, what's going on here? [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5952.16s)]
*  Cause every night again, like you'll see a bad switch and like somebody will end [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5953.8s)]
*  up on towns who's like six, three. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5958.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5961.12s)]
*  But this really like it happened enough where I like, oh no, that's the plan. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5961.76s)]
*  People try to use towns against himself is the plan. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5965.2s)]
*  The good and bad of towns. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5969.88s)]
*  They hope the bad goes out. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5971.08s)]
*  By the way, last question. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5972.12s)]
*  Are you worried about one Soto or no? [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5973.04s)]
*  He played, they played the red Sox this week and he seemed, I seemed a little [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5975.4400000000005s)]
*  sullen. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5979.88s)]
*  I would have sullen is the word I would use. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5980.68s)]
*  You don't remember the first year of Francisco Lindor. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5982.56s)]
*  You don't remember the first year of Carlos Beltran. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5985.08s)]
*  You don't remember. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5986.88s)]
*  And by the way, uh, you don't remember the first four years of Jason Bay. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5987.84s)]
*  Like people come in there. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5991.52s)]
*  First of all, Juan Soto right now is not failing. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5993.4800000000005s)]
*  He's not all star Juan Soto, but he's still a very solid performer in a lineup [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=5996.8s)]
*  that's underperformed recently, but you're not talking about the emotions. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6003.24s)]
*  He's played a much better outfield than I think people thought he was going to [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6006.88s)]
*  play. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6011.52s)]
*  And I'm not going to read the like facial expressions of a superstar that's going [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6012.12s)]
*  to be here for 15 years. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6019.320000000001s)]
*  Who already seems sad. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6021.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6023.88s)]
*  Like I didn't, I never thought of him as like the happy warrior to begin with. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6024.4800000000005s)]
*  Like I didn't bring him over here. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6028.240000000001s)]
*  Cause I, you know, get excited about it. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6029.8s)]
*  Cause I thought he was super entertaining and gregarious. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6031.92s)]
*  I just thought. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6035.16s)]
*  See, this is what Mets nation needed. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6035.84s)]
*  They needed this defense. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6037.56s)]
*  But we're always worried about everything. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6039.24s)]
*  Again, you're talking about, uh, a fan base that like whatever will go wrong, [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6042.2s)]
*  whatever could go wrong, goes wrong. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6050.320000000001s)]
*  Tyrese Halliburton throws up a fucking prayer. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6052.360000000001s)]
*  It hits the back of the rim, goes straight up in the air. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6055.6s)]
*  And in any other universe, other than the New York Knicks universe, it [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6060.8s)]
*  goes over the backboard. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6066.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6067.88s)]
*  That's the arc. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6068.2s)]
*  The ball is supposed to travel. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6069.32s)]
*  It's the highest it other than maybe the clash at the highest that they, the [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6071.2s)]
*  game winner has gone or a game tire. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6075.8s)]
*  I've never seen anything like it. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6077.68s)]
*  Uh, for God's sakes, the, the little stat track said the Knicks at 99.8%. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6080.2s)]
*  They're going to like only in New York, New York Mets are going to go to the [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6084.92s)]
*  thing, you went to Cesspitus breaks his ankle, riding a bull. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6089.56s)]
*  Like only shit that can happen happens to us. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6093.120000000001s)]
*  And over time you expect it. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6097.68s)]
*  So, you know, that's what they've done with the Mets is already fighting [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6101.88s)]
*  the gravity of our history. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6107.84s)]
*  What Cohen has been able to do with them, what Stearns has been able to do with [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6109.92s)]
*  them is to counteract the gravity of our history in a way that looks like we [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6113.360000000001s)]
*  might actually be competitive for years. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6118.52s)]
*  That's never been the case. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6122.360000000001s)]
*  That happened with the Red Sox when, uh, when they, they specifically, when they [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6124.160000000001s)]
*  got many 2000, they actually spent money on them and it took a couple of years, [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6128.240000000001s)]
*  but at least like the foundation was laid for like, Oh, we traded for Pedro. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6133.040000000001s)]
*  We got many. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6136.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6137.8s)]
*  Now we can actually like maybe fight the Yankees. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6138.240000000001s)]
*  You also built a farm system that started to bring up studs. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6140.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6145.96s)]
*  Like that's the key. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6146.5199999999995s)]
*  Like the Mets, even before, uh, when Cohen was there, they were still doing shit. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6148.5599999999995s)]
*  Like, all right, well, we want to be good. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6152.679999999999s)]
*  Who are the oldest pitchers we can pay? [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6155.32s)]
*  Find me two of the oldest pitchers and pay them more than anybody's ever gotten. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6158.4s)]
*  And maybe they'll, you know, make us good for six months. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6163.32s)]
*  Now they've taken, Stearns has come in and completely flipped the approach. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6166.24s)]
*  He's building a ground up solid infrastructure. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6171.24s)]
*  Will you win the world series? [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6176.24s)]
*  Who fucking knows the world series is it's a crap shoot and the Dodgers are going [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6177.52s)]
*  to be there for a while and the Yankees are going to be there and, but they're at [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6181.4400000000005s)]
*  least you want to be good. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6185.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6189.16s)]
*  That's what that's all you can hope for. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6189.84s)]
*  And that's what Leon Rose, uh, uh, and Thibodeau have done for the Knicks. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6191.88s)]
*  It's much harder to keep going in the NBA. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6198.08s)]
*  But, you know, because I, I don't know how you feel about this, but I feel like [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6200.759999999999s)]
*  the NBA cap rules and all that other shit. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6205.28s)]
*  No, they fucked it up. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6207.48s)]
*  It's, we've been talking about it on my pod constantly. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6208.36s)]
*  They fucked it up. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6210.799999999999s)]
*  They, how are we not able to pay heart and see what we wanted to pay him? [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6212.2s)]
*  That makes no sense. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6216.04s)]
*  We wanted to keep that dude and we couldn't. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6217.639999999999s)]
*  The problem is they reward bad teams who throw away seasons and get high picks. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6221.0s)]
*  Is a better strategy than just like signing players smartly, making good [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6226.599999999999s)]
*  trades, drafting well, and then you somehow get penalized for it. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6231.08s)]
*  They shouldn't have been penalized for the heart and stain thing. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6235.04s)]
*  Cause that was such a great, such a great signing. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6237.599999999999s)]
*  But then they had been able to keep him. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6241.08s)]
*  My guess is they probably, they don't do the towns. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6243.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6247.12s)]
*  They would have run it back, still would have gotten bridges. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6247.92s)]
*  And then you would be a deeper team. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6251.16s)]
*  Yes. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6253.679999999999s)]
*  I loved how, when they were deeper. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6254.4s)]
*  I'm, I'm, I like that. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6256.36s)]
*  Like Indiana's built really well. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6257.88s)]
*  They really are. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6261.48s)]
*  And this is interesting too. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6262.36s)]
*  I wonder what you think about this. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6263.48s)]
*  This is such a repudiation of like the super team. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6266.88s)]
*  Like these are great teams, but these aren't superstar teams. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6269.679999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6273.8s)]
*  Other than like, okay, she's got, [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6274.12s)]
*  you know, the league is so much deeper now. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6276.24s)]
*  You can actually build a team a little differently and you don't have to have [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6279.48s)]
*  like the top heavy best two guys. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6282.639999999999s)]
*  You can actually go seven, eight, nine deep. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6284.4s)]
*  That's what the Celtics tried to do. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6287.4s)]
*  I mean, then they had too many injuries this year, but. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6288.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6291.24s)]
*  But even the cell, like imagine having Tatum and, and Brown, and then like having [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6291.599999999999s)]
*  to worry about holding your team together, like teams shouldn't have to worry about [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6296.839999999999s)]
*  holding together like that. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6300.4s)]
*  That's bullshit. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6301.4s)]
*  You're preaching on the choir. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6303.36s)]
*  John Stewart, this was great. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6305.04s)]
*  Thank you for all the time. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6306.719999999999s)]
*  I'm glad we finally did this. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6307.879999999999s)]
*  It's so nice to see you. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6bEfVbT4uw&t=6309.0s)]
