# Celtics Up 2-0 Instant Reactions with Ryen Russillo | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IvqtxF9RUw)
*  I went to game two of the NBA finals, so did Brian Rosillo.
*  It was, I wrote down on my way home, multiple heart attacks,
*  turnovers and missed threes, could never land a knockout punch,
*  as many Tatum questions as answers, poor Zigus might be hurt,
*  and we somehow covered it, we're up two nothing.
*  Those are my initial notes.
*  It was just a classic heart attack special,
*  and now they're in the driver's seat,
*  and it's gonna be a very tough team
*  when you're 78 and 20 in the season
*  to conceive of them losing four out of five times.
*  That's why I want to start there.
*  Where is your Nick Chubb level right now?
*  My what level?
*  Nick Chubb, running back, ever heard of him?
*  What's my Nick Chubb level? I don't know what that means.
*  Just level of arousalment, excitement.
*  You're self-sufficient, Bill.
*  Where are you? Let's start there.
*  Let's start there.
*  Let's take the floor.
*  I just want to know how you feel.
*  I love Drew Holiday.
*  He is 2004 Patriots personified.
*  He was unbelievable again tonight.
*  I think he had 26 and 11 rebounds and zero turnovers,
*  and he guarded Luca and Kyrie for as much of the game
*  as possible, and in the second half,
*  it didn't seem like Luca was psyched to have Drew on him.
*  I thought he was the steadiest, best player on the court
*  on either end other than Luca, and that trade,
*  the fact that Milwaukee makes this big move for Dame,
*  they trade Drew to Portland,
*  he ends up on Boston five days later,
*  and he's been their best player in the finals.
*  It's just crazy how that worked out.
*  Milwaukee makes this big trade to beat Boston
*  and gives Boston the guy who's been the difference maker
*  in a bunch of these games.
*  Where do you think, I just thought of this,
*  this could have been a whole title for a pod,
*  but the anger rankings of other franchises
*  watching this series play out, where's Milwaukee?
*  Is there anyone higher than Milwaukee?
*  Is Minnesota, I still think Minnesota should be so mad
*  going like, hey, we probably matched up better
*  against Boston if Cat, I know we've covered the Cat stuff
*  already earlier on the pod today.
*  I just, just out of the top of my mind, I'm like,
*  I wonder how many other franchises are watching this
*  going like, are you fucking kidding me?
*  So that's a great question, I'd put Denver first.
*  Because Denver matched up with Boston the best
*  and they just have to be like, oh my God,
*  we're out in round two and now watching Boston.
*  20 point lead to Minnesota at home.
*  In a game seven blew it, so I'd put them first.
*  I would put probably Milwaukee second
*  for giving Drew Holiday to their biggest rival in the East.
*  And then, Minnesota has to be watching this series going,
*  oh, that's what we should have done.
*  And we said this during and after
*  that Minnesota Dallas series, I just don't understand
*  a lot of the decisions they made, especially with Kyrie.
*  And one of my big predictions I made all week was like,
*  I just thought Boston matched up really well with Kyrie.
*  I thought that Kyrie praise was some of the most
*  over the top stuff that I can remember with national media
*  talking about whether this was the best scoring
*  backcourt of all time.
*  Just talking about him like he was Allen Iverson in 2001
*  and he had 16 points, he was seven for 18 for 16 points,
*  a ton of hero ball and Boston just kept throwing guards
*  and size and just kind of making him go one on one
*  and take bad shots.
*  And he was dribbling into two guys,
*  he was throwing the ball to teammates with like four seconds
*  left in the shot clock, I thought he was abysmal.
*  I thought he was so bad in that game.
*  Yeah, I don't think the stats will tell the full story.
*  I thought he was awful.
*  I didn't wanna text you because I wanted us to talk about it
*  live on the pod, I thought he was so bad.
*  Yeah, because it was a lot of like, all right,
*  I'll get us there and then he hits a shot
*  and he's letting the crowd have it
*  and the crowd's letting him have it the whole time.
*  And then I was over in this corner
*  where they were really giving it to him again
*  during a time stoppage and then he starts turning,
*  being like bring it on, bring it on.
*  And clearly he has that gear in him.
*  So it's not like Grant Williams being like,
*  I'll be your hero, I'll be your villain, right?
*  I mean, this is Kyrie.
*  But I kept waiting for like these buckets to happen
*  and I kept thinking like there was this one attempt,
*  I think it was 189 and he took a three
*  and it was like clearly a, I'm just gonna take this shot.
*  Which he certainly has the right to take,
*  but there was just a lot of him tonight
*  where I was like, this is sort of flash.
*  Do you remember that Jaylen Brown position
*  where he stayed in front of him in the first half
*  when he tried to work Jaylen?
*  That was unbelievable defense by Brown.
*  They just have a great team to guard them
*  and I think if you're Minnesota watching this,
*  you're just wondering why you didn't have McDaniels on him
*  as much as humanly possible and just try to put him
*  in a position where he's trying to beat guys one on one.
*  Because the other thing,
*  he's not getting other guys involved.
*  He's got 28 points in two games,
*  but it's not like he's setting guys up.
*  He's not creating when he creates a second loop.
*  Like now when PJ Washington has an open three,
*  I just kind of shrugged and I know he had 17,
*  but he was one of five from three.
*  Passing up threes too.
*  Right, they had to run Gafford as the number one option
*  offensively in the third quarter
*  because that was the Tatum thing
*  that we need to spend some time on
*  and what Dallas was attacking.
*  And then you've got Jones who's over three from three.
*  All of these things, OKC's gotta be watching this.
*  Just like you said with Minnesota,
*  so now you guys are gonna turn back into the shooters
*  that we weren't afraid of
*  as opposed to making everything and taking turns
*  or looking like Steph out there.
*  So I don't even know that Kyrie has anyone to pass to right
*  now that I'm even afraid of.
*  They had two lobs.
*  The corner three thing is non-existent
*  because nobody's helping.
*  Because everybody can play straight up defensively
*  for Boston.
*  Yeah.
*  Well the other piece, you know,
*  it's the finals and you're on the road
*  and it's a different kind of spotlight.
*  Which was one of those as somebody who likes the Celtics
*  I was counting on.
*  It's like cool, PJ Washten and Jones were making threes
*  in these earlier rounds, but it's a little different.
*  They've made two corner threes.
*  They've made two corner threes in two games.
*  Well and you made the key point.
*  PJ was passing up threes by the second half
*  and he made a couple good drives and little floaters
*  and does that weird little Euro step jump hook thing
*  that goes in sometimes.
*  But the Celtics were, I mean they couldn't have been happier
*  when Jones was open with the ball from 24.
*  They were like, knock yourself out dude.
*  They weren't even guarding him.
*  He went 0 for 3 with an air ball.
*  PJ wasn't making threes.
*  Kleba who, you know, Dallas over and over again
*  has been able in the last like four or five minutes
*  of these playoff games, they turned into the 2004 Pistons
*  on defense, I don't really understand it.
*  But they were scrambling with Kleba,
*  but he couldn't make a shot either.
*  He doesn't want to shoot.
*  He doesn't, he's done this now twice in this series
*  where he's been on the right side, the right break,
*  going left to right and he has a catch.
*  I'm like, okay, let's see it.
*  His shoulder must be messed up to the point
*  where he doesn't even want to shoot,
*  which is a huge problem
*  because he's actually pretty good defensively
*  and you could think, all right,
*  if the lively Gafford stuff isn't happening,
*  then maybe we can give it a different look and go five out
*  and it opens up some of the stuff for Luke and Kyrie.
*  But now Kleba would be somebody,
*  I would be saying if you're the Celtics being like,
*  don't even close out on him until he makes like two
*  of these.
*  Yeah, and Boston was doing some funky stuff in this game
*  that I liked.
*  Like they were playing three guards.
*  They were playing white and howled
*  and pritchard a couple of times.
*  And they're in a situation where,
*  they missed so many threes.
*  Hauser came in and had a one man rock fight.
*  I think he was 0 for five and all five threes were open.
*  But when you think about how many threes
*  that the Celtics missed,
*  we were saying before the series,
*  I thought Boston and six was my pick
*  because I thought there'd be one game
*  that Luca just won by himself.
*  And I thought there would be one game
*  that the Celtics just didn't make any threes.
*  That was tonight.
*  They didn't make any threes.
*  And they somehow won by seven and they somehow covered.
*  They were 10 for 39 from three.
*  But on the flip side,
*  the Mavericks were two for 17 on the non-Luca threes.
*  And if you're looking at them,
*  you're 89 points in the first game,
*  98 points in this game.
*  And you and I look for the same things
*  when we watch these games sometimes.
*  It's like, A, do I like the shots you're getting?
*  And B, am I worried about the shots you're getting?
*  And in this case,
*  I thought Dallas just had a lot of possessions
*  where I just didn't like their shots.
*  Luca made some crazy, crazy threes, one-legged stuff.
*  But for the most part,
*  I didn't like the shots they got.
*  And I don't really know what the fix is.
*  They don't have another creator other than those two guys.
*  So if they're gonna shut out Kyrie, what's the fix?
*  Well, what we liked about it
*  was it was two on-ball creators,
*  which I think every team needs as like a default thing
*  to go deep into the playoffs.
*  And when it was working for Dallas, you're like, okay.
*  But it's because all the other stuff was working too.
*  And there's certain things with Minnesota
*  where I would say
*  that's gonna be incredibly frustrating for them.
*  But then the other stuff that Boston does on offense
*  where I think Minnesota can't even be mad about it,
*  because this is the whole point of Boston.
*  When Boston's at its best, it's five out,
*  it's five different shooters,
*  it's four guys that are pretty good
*  with the ball in their hands.
*  And even Horford isn't a mess
*  if he has to take a couple dribbles.
*  Perzingis can put it on the deck for a couple.
*  It's not like you're gonna ice so
*  and he's gonna just cook the whole time.
*  But it's just a lot of people
*  that are good with the ball in their hands.
*  And that's gonna put stress on Dallas' defense
*  in a way where Minnesota,
*  they could ignore all these other players.
*  So you've been over that.
*  So I think there's some things in Minnesota
*  where it's frustrating.
*  And then some things where you have to be realistic
*  where you go, well, I couldn't pull that anyway,
*  so what am I even trying to do?
*  But Luca had 20 points with 10 minutes remaining
*  in the second quarter.
*  20.
*  It looked like he was headed for 60.
*  It was, it was-
*  He hit one shot and the crowd made that groan.
*  Where it was like,
*  and we've been at those games a couple of times,
*  me and my dad were, when that groan happens,
*  we're like, oh no.
*  This is gonna be one of those games where Luca has like 54.
*  And-
*  But he had more assists.
*  There was other things that were happening too,
*  but go ahead.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I remember that I looked up at one point
*  and it felt like Dallas was dominating the game
*  and Luca was hot.
*  And it was like 35, 29, right?
*  They're up six.
*  That's the whole first half.
*  That's a good sign.
*  They're down six. In the building.
*  They're down four.
*  They're down six.
*  They're down two.
*  They're up four.
*  The entire first half is playing out the way it did.
*  And of course, Luca getting off to that incredible start.
*  But from that point on,
*  where he had the 20 at 10 minutes left in the second quarter,
*  he had only five points over,
*  I think the next like 17 plus game minutes.
*  So you're like, wait.
*  Now he's not even involved with the scoring,
*  certainly at the pace,
*  but it's like now it's kind of non-existent.
*  And the whole game in the first half,
*  I think you agree, I think that's what you're saying,
*  is that it felt one way and the score consistently
*  said something different the whole time.
*  Yeah, I wrote down in my notes,
*  it was Boston 36, 35, took the lead,
*  seven minutes left second quarter,
*  big white three for the lead.
*  Luca 20, I wrote down.
*  Tatum was one for seven.
*  And I wrote.
*  Celtics two for 12 from three and winning,
*  three question marks.
*  Cause it was just unclear how they were winning
*  cause Luca was playing well.
*  But the thing is nobody else in Dallas was playing well.
*  And that was, that was the big thing.
*  Like you mentioned that there was a little tiny Gafford
*  stretch there and he had a couple of big offensive rebounds.
*  PJ made a couple of plays,
*  but if Kyrie is going to take 18 shots for 16 points,
*  they're not going to be Boston in any of these games.
*  Right?
*  They're going to have to have somebody beyond Luca
*  who can score.
*  And I also felt.
*  No, they need 60 points from those two.
*  And then let me know what happened with everybody else.
*  Yeah, they need to be in the hundreds.
*  Cause this Celtics team,
*  it's just too hard for them to be under a hundred.
*  But, but sitting up close watching Luca,
*  I thought he got to, first of all, kid,
*  there was a couple more.
*  I actually liked how kid coached in that game
*  because there were multiple moments where it felt like
*  they were going to get like the Celtics were going to
*  blow them out.
*  My dad and I kept, we were talking like, this is it.
*  We're up 10.
*  This is the run right here.
*  And they would miss a three, but kid felt it.
*  And I think in the third quarter,
*  he just decided I can't take Luca and Kyrie out.
*  Cause I think he was going to try to stagger the minutes.
*  And he just was like, all right, fuck it.
*  And left those guys in, but they, he just didn't,
*  like they put Jayden Hardy in the third quarter.
*  And I think he was hoping like, Oh,
*  Jayden Hardy, rational confidence.
*  And Drew's like, I'll take, I'll take Hardy.
*  And that was it.
*  We never saw Hardy, but they just,
*  they just can't score enough points.
*  And this is the first time, you know,
*  in these other series, they would keep it close,
*  keep it close, keep it close.
*  And then Luca would steal the game down the last four
*  minutes. But I think it's,
*  I think it's too hard for them this series.
*  So for them to flip it, what happens?
*  What would be like the three things you think,
*  like Kyrie would have to, I think just,
*  it sounds stupid, but he'd have to shoot better.
*  But you know,
*  for 18 shots, I didn't mind the shots.
*  Yeah. I mean, Kyrie going 12 for 18 instead of 718
*  would be one thing.
*  I don't really know those role guys, I guess.
*  Could you say, all right, Jones and PJ,
*  if you go eight for 12 from three, that'll help.
*  But I don't trust those guys.
*  So it's, it's really the defense and the stuff that I
*  thought they stumbled into the last five minutes,
*  when it was 103, 89,
*  and then all of a sudden it just felt like Boston
*  couldn't score anymore.
*  And they really felt like they unlocked something
*  defensively.
*  And I think that's what they're probably going to
*  concentrate on. Like, maybe this is how we win.
*  These games have to be like 92 to 89.
*  That's the recipe.
*  Yeah. But that's just saying like,
*  Hey, let's do this.
*  Cause I want to,
*  I want to talk about like the biggest thing.
*  Tatum was terrible, which I know we're going to talk about.
*  So I'm not jumping ahead.
*  Cause you have this look on your face,
*  like I'm screwing up the, the outline.
*  I think that's an after the break combo.
*  I'm ready to have it.
*  He was awful.
*  So I was wondering, cause when I originally,
*  cause game starts, I'm looking for like,
*  what are they looking for?
*  They wanted to get Tatum on Luca as much as they
*  possibly could.
*  Their decision was let's attack Tatum where I'm going,
*  Whoa.
*  Cause Tatum is a very good defensive player,
*  but it seems like they were just trying to put miles on
*  him and try to wear him out is my guess.
*  Yeah. And Luca was actually beating him,
*  but then there would be these Kyrie possessions and they
*  were like, put Tatum back in it.
*  And I'm like, man, is this, is the guys, I kept thinking like,
*  Oh, was there something else coming from this?
*  Where then there's a lob waiting.
*  I kind of two lobs in this game.
*  Yeah.
*  We mentioned the corner three stuff that didn't happen.
*  Do you think Jason Kidd cared more about the take than he
*  did winning game two that Jalen Brown is the better Celtic?
*  Was that your first take these?
*  Jason Kidd said it's not about the game or the finals.
*  It's about the take.
*  And that's why we put Tatum in a blender.
*  JP's the best Celtic.
*  Listen, the fact that he did that made me feel better about
*  the Celtics chances.
*  Cause the time doing that after the first game to me said that
*  Jason Kidd didn't like how the series was going.
*  Like that's a move you make when it's an early water three one.
*  I mean, he played the card after one game.
*  He's playing the, let me start a Tatum Brown thing.
*  I thought it was bold, but it made me think that he feels
*  like he doesn't have that great of a hand in the poker game.
*  Right.
*  Do you think he comes back after, before game three is
*  like, honestly, revolutionary war started in South Carolina.
*  That's a great call.
*  No, no, let me just stay with it for a second.
*  Cause I think it was, cause people were like,
*  what do you think?
*  Like I'm shocked that somebody did it.
*  Clearly he did it for a reason, but these guys have been
*  together now going back to the 17, 18 series.
*  Like maybe if they were 23, maybe it would get in the head
*  a little bit, but like Tatum's actually,
*  his passing was good tonight, but I just didn't think it was
*  going to affect those guys going through the wars that
*  they've already been through together.
*  I was amazed by it cause it was so clear he was doing it for
*  a reason, hoping it was going to work.
*  And your points awesome.
*  Like that's a game for move.
*  Yeah.
*  That's like a, we're down three, one.
*  Let me throw this against the wall.
*  Holiday said after the game about Tatum and Brown, I feel like how they play
*  together and how they work together is something that is sacred and
*  something that can't be broken.
*  Wow.
*  And I think I agree.
*  I've watched those guys for a long time and I just feel like, I feel
*  like they're on the same page.
*  I don't feel like there's ego with those guys at all.
*  I just don't.
*  I don't see it.
*  All right.
*  Jason Tatum is now 56 for one 58 in eight NBA final games shooting,
*  which is 35.4%.
*  Um, he finished 18, nine and 12, 12 assists and a lot of them were nice
*  assists six for 22 shooting garden.
*  Luke a lot rebounded played hard body language, body language.
*  He was bad, man.
*  He was the body language was bizarre because it got to the point that
*  cause he wasn't playing well.
*  Nobody's in a good mood.
*  No one's body language is awesome.
*  When you play as bad as Tatum does for somebody that's supposed to play really
*  special, it's supposed to be finals.
*  MVP.
*  I don't know that anybody would ever have great body language playing
*  the way he just did tonight.
*  I mean, as bad as he was in game one tonight in person was so much more
*  horrifying because of just seeing somebody stuck in between decisions.
*  Like he was shot tonight mentally.
*  The level is a body language and this is why I brought it up to your four.
*  Sorry.
*  Let me think.
*  Uh, yellow when somebody makes a shot and they do the thing where they look
*  up at the sky, like finally, thank you.
*  That's when I get concerned because you're the fifth best player in the
*  league.
*  You shouldn't be surprised that you just drove through the lane, got fouled
*  and finished a layup.
*  And it should be like a fist pump.
*  Like finally I got it.
*  His was more like, uh, I have the weight of the world on my shoulders and
*  finally something went my way.
*  And that was what scared me and my dad.
*  Cause we were like, you don't know.
*  Like key words to Donna below Delta.
*  It just didn't like it.
*  I thought second half it was better, but first does that all the time, by the way,
*  was alarming.
*  Well, Luca does that all the time.
*  He's pissed.
*  Luca does that all the time.
*  He's pissed.
*  I haven't gone in the about damn time.
*  Yeah, this was different.
*  It didn't, it was Tatum did not instill a lot of confidence in that first
*  half and it was the big at halftime.
*  It was what everybody was talking about in whatever section you were.
*  I was like, what the fuck's wrong with Tatum?
*  What's wrong with him?
*  And then somebody else would be like, nah, he's having a good game.
*  No, he wasn't, man.
*  Now he's got five, eight assists.
*  Whatever.
*  Like I look at, cause I know people just can never get past the stock about Kyrie,
*  but like Kyrie was awesome compared to Tatum.
*  I mean, this was, he got put into every action so you could say, oh no, he was
*  tired.
*  He was tired.
*  He's stuck in between like what he wants to do.
*  And when I looked at the first game, you go, okay, his first shot attempt was at
*  3 19 to the first quarter.
*  All right.
*  He had two field goal attempts in the first quarter, but you were looking at it
*  where it wasn't always a zone, but it looked like a zone the way they were
*  paying attention to him.
*  And I thought his first good look was like a dunk with two and a half minutes
*  to go in the first half.
*  Like that was the first good look.
*  But here's the point is they were up 37 20 after the first quarter because
*  everybody's firing.
*  Porzingis is great.
*  So like that part of the Tatum thing is like, all right, and then they're up 58
*  29.
*  So it's like, what am I really even looking at here?
*  Because this game was tighter throughout, you're paying attention to the longer
*  stretches of Tatum.
*  Like the six turnovers in game one were all terrible.
*  They were all bad.
*  And I thought at some point he had figured out, Hey, the help is constantly
*  coming up.
*  That's where that drew holiday thing is happening time after time.
*  And then there's that Derek White little baseline thing that you can look for.
*  So that part of Tatum's game, it looked like it was coming around, but every layup
*  was like coming off the rim.
*  But then it was all wearing on him.
*  He missed four fast layups.
*  Those hard layups to the basket that sometime when he's not going well, he'll
*  just miss those.
*  And that reminded me of 2022 watching it.
*  But that's where I think down the stretch, it just started getting uglier and
*  uglier.
*  He was one of seven in the fourth quarter and it looked like when he was catching
*  the ball.
*  I don't know if you'd agree or disagree.
*  Like the thing that always scares me with a player who's really special and Tatum
*  is, is you're like, Oh, he doesn't know what he wants to do because none of it
*  is working.
*  And that's where you're like, maybe just give the ball to somebody else then.
*  So even if you look at, I like on ESPN, you can do the play by play and you can
*  just look at the shot chart for individual guys.
*  And the thing my dad and I were talking about the last piece for him, because I
*  don't think he's a finished product yet.
*  I know some people he's played over a hundred games.
*  Now I feel like, I feel like there's no, I'm not ready to go there yet.
*  Cause I think, I think there's one other piece to his game that he just, he can't
*  figure out.
*  And here it is.
*  I'm looking at the shot chart.
*  He didn't take a single shot in that like foul line paint anywhere from eight to
*  15 feet around the foul line, which the Mavs were giving him over and over again.
*  And if he beat his guy off the dribble, it was either I'm going to the rim or I'm
*  going to the rim and kicking out.
*  And it wasn't just like, I'm just going to stop and take this little 10 footer,
*  which is what makes Lucas so special is Luca gets by people.
*  And then it doesn't really matter.
*  He'll shoot it on anywhere in the court.
*  And I just, for whatever reason, Tatum cannot unlock that piece mentally of just,
*  I'm just, I'll just shoot from 12 and I'll make it.
*  And it's something he used to do earlier in his career.
*  I just, I don't get it.
*  I got to tell you, Bill, I love the work here on the shot chart.
*  You're looking at it.
*  Yeah.
*  Look how empty.
*  I'm looking at it.
*  It is around the foul line.
*  It's fucking crazy.
*  Chris Paul land is deserted.
*  That's a great way to put it.
*  The Chris Paul shot is the thing.
*  That's why I don't feel like he's a finished product yet.
*  Cause what he needs is the Chris Paul shot.
*  Cause he's beating these guys off the dribble and then he does know what he
*  wants to do after he beats them.
*  And the Mavs are just like, we're going to protect the rim on you.
*  We want to make you go fast and whip layoffs against the backboard or kick it out.
*  And if he had, if he ever gets that 12 footer, it'll be something.
*  But I just don't think he's a finished product yet.
*  I know that's crazy.
*  No, but now, now I understand what you're saying.
*  I mean, it's still kind of disagree, but I just think sometimes when people have
*  absurd numbers when they're young and they're like, Oh, imagine when he's 27.
*  And you're like, well, what do you think?
*  He's just going to give this guy 40.
*  And I know that's not what you're doing with Tatum.
*  And tonight was so bad.
*  Like last night or excuse me, game one, I watched all of his
*  possessions in his drives again.
*  I was like, man, they are showing him a ton of traffic and he's, he's just
*  not ready for it yet.
*  And the six turnovers, all of them are bad.
*  There's not one where you're like, Oh, that one kind of really wasn't on him.
*  They're actually, it's kind of rare that you could have that many turnovers and
*  not have a couple where you feel like, ah, that's not that bad.
*  But tonight I thought, okay, he'll, he'll probably look at this a little differently.
*  He'll be more aggressive.
*  He's going to be ready for that help.
*  And that's where the passing came in.
*  The close of the game, I was, you just see it.
*  You could just see it.
*  It's like, he doesn't really know what he wants to do.
*  And as they were about to piss that lead away, did you want the ball in his hands
*  or did you want to Andrew or Browns?
*  It granted a lot of Drew's work was coming off of the Tatum drives.
*  So there's still value of what he does and how much he attracts the defense his way.
*  But did you want the ball in his hands?
*  When the, when it was like a nine Oh run there by Dallas,
*  it was one Oh three 89.
*  And then all of a sudden it was one Oh three 98.
*  And it was the Celts did the thing that they've been doing for the entire Tatum
*  Brown era where they had a lead and they slowed down and they basically go into
*  four corners offense and get a lot of shots near the end of the shot clock.
*  And all of their bad habits came in.
*  It sounds, it's just crazy to complain about a team that 78 and 20 is up to
*  Oh in the finals.
*  But this was, this game was a microcosm of a lot of the stuff that has gotten
*  the Celtic fans worried over the years.
*  And I do think if Luca was, was healthier, I think he would have stolen the game.
*  Cause the big thing that I felt, especially in the second half was I just didn't
*  like the way Luca was moving.
*  And, uh, you know, I'd heard some, they did that weird thing with the injury
*  report before the game where they said he was questionable to play.
*  Obviously he was playing.
*  I talked to some Celtics people who said there were people sitting near the bench,
*  uh, during game one and a couple of times he came out and just kind of
*  pointed to his knee, like he had a problem with the side of his knee.
*  And I don't love the way he's moving.
*  And I don't think he was moving like this last round.
*  Like if this version of Luca we're watching this round was in the Minnesota
*  series, that series is probably different.
*  If Luca gets hurt and sits out the rest of the series, worst title ever.
*  Now that would be head games by kid.
*  Watch this Luca out for game three.
*  Now what are you going to do Boston?
*  Uh, but here's the thing.
*  Like he's pointing to his knee.
*  He had like a jog bra on of some kind of wrap around his chest on maybe the
*  Brown collision that was pretty violent in game one.
*  So then it was like, what is it?
*  And it was an upper body thing that he was even downgrading like a rib or something.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  So he's he's I'll give that he's hurt.
*  I'm not dismissing that.
*  I'm just telling you he's first team all NBA when I'm hurt,
*  you're going to know I'm hurt.
*  Fair.
*  Did you think he looked better last round or this round?
*  I think he looked better last round and there was a stretch even tonight's game
*  where I go is, is he more hurt now?
*  Cause they're down nine or 10.
*  Oh, it's one of those.
*  It's like, yeah, I think he's, I think he's part, I think he's a really
*  dramatic guy out there.
*  Do you think I'm crazy on that one?
*  I mean, I can't imagine anybody's watched him and would think otherwise
*  or they just haven't noticed it.
*  Well, I saw him in the first round against the Quippers twice and I didn't think he
*  was moving great in that series.
*  Uh, I would agree.
*  And then I thought it was even worse against Oklahoma city and the till he closed.
*  And then I thought Minnesota looked awesome.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, so he, he may be dinged up and there'll be something or whatever.
*  I'm just telling you when he has something that is bothering him physically, he
*  wears it like not just a shirt, but like he wears it like a fucking stove.
*  Like pipe hat.
*  Is that what it's called?
*  What did Abe wear?
*  Stovepipe?
*  Yeah.
*  Stovepipe hat.
*  One of the things that I think wasn't helping him was that they have all these
*  different guys that can try to attack him.
*  And I don't know what the numbers are because we're taping this right after
*  the game, how many times he had to defend somebody one-on-one or fight the
*  Ropeic or stay with somebody.
*  And you know, that's Minnesota does.
*  They're not putting the miles on you.
*  Right.
*  It's basically, and was their only creator from the perimeter.
*  Um, there's really nobody else and then guys, right.
*  So it was just a much easier series for him.
*  Um, I, my guess is that Dallas comes back in game three and shoots better.
*  But if I was a maps fan, I would be concerned that the Celtics haven't
*  shot the ball yet that well.
*  And that they actually have had some really good road games, not just
*  in the playoffs, but all season.
*  Like I don't, to me, this is an, oh, this is what happens.
*  Series doesn't start.
*  Like I think either of those teams could win on either floor and I could totally
*  see the Celtics going into Dallas and game three and really shooting the lights out.
*  Um, it's a fascinating, what do you think the line is for game three, by the way?
*  Boston minus.
*  You think Boston's favorite in game three?
*  Yeah.
*  Dallas is favored by one and a half.
*  Whoa.
*  The Celtics are now 10 to one favorites to win the finals.
*  What's the finals MVP now, by the way?
*  Where's the MVP is now almost midnight.
*  Tatum is even odds.
*  Jalen Brown plus one 85 Lucas plus six 50 and drew holidays nine to one.
*  And if I had to vote, I'd vote for drew right now after two games.
*  So you're surprised that you're not surprised that Dallas is favored because
*  there's a matchup argument here, especially with the advanced stuff of how much Vegas
*  and every model has loved Boston.
*  Um, and I, God, I'm, I'm a little surprised that you could get points with
*  Boston, even with the notorious let down.
*  There's a lot of good game three team down two.
*  Oh, no, you're talking back home.
*  You're talking to cap.
*  You can't fake desperate, but this is a bad basketball matchup for Dallas.
*  Oh, I'm serious.
*  Like, no, you're right.
*  It's a bad matchup for him.
*  And you had to hope Luca could continue the superhero trend that we, that we've
*  seen now, by the way, for a few weeks and those supporting cast, like he had to,
*  he had to do what he's been doing with the supporting cast maintaining.
*  And right now they're, they're not even a factor.
*  It's just so funny how different it feels when those guys catch the ball.
*  Now, maybe it'll be different at home.
*  Um, and I certainly respect Dallas and Luca enough to get one.
*  I guess I'm just with something still at play here.
*  Here's the point I actually should make.
*  If I'm a Dallas fan, I'm furious.
*  I'm furious.
*  They lost game two because this is the game that everybody in Boston has been
*  worried about for six months that, yeah, even if they get there, they're going to
*  have that awful game where they stink it up from three, they were six of 30 Boston
*  was, and they were up 83 74.
*  Okay.
*  And then they gave us, as you pointed to this had every single Boston.
*  Like fuck upsetting.
*  They played the ever have, they did everything in this game.
*  Tatum was awful.
*  They couldn't make threes.
*  Luca was torching them.
*  And then they're up and they give up the nine Oh run and the whole building's
*  like, are you seriously about to blow this game?
*  Are you seriously going to do this?
*  Is this going to be the Atlanta Hawks week all over again with the NBA
*  championship on the line?
*  Like, what do you guys can't get a bucket with all of these options?
*  Not one of you is going to get a stop.
*  They did all of those things in the last two and a half hours and Dallas
*  still couldn't win the game.
*  And that nine Oh run was coming off.
*  Poor Zingas seemingly getting hurt.
*  Yeah.
*  And then he's limping on everyone's watching him going, ah, he looks hurt.
*  We should take them out.
*  Possession.
*  They don't take them out.
*  Dallas has the ball.
*  They don't take them out.
*  Possession again.
*  They don't take them out.
*  Kyrie.
*  Beat somebody up the dribble and poor Zingas has the chase down block behind
*  as he decides not to go for it.
*  And let's Kyrie have the layup and an hour earlier would have just blocked it.
*  Then Joe calls the timeout and he said afterwards that he's fine, but he did
*  not look fine to me and I thought, I thought he tweeted it, but you have, so
*  you have the KP tweaks is whatever.
*  And then the Celtics go in that crazy funk.
*  Um, but Drew, when it was 97, 89, that was when KP tweaked his leg.
*  They call timeout.
*  And then the big sequence was drew getting that steel when they kind of
*  trapped Dallas and half court and drew gets the steel and ends up hitting the three.
*  They get a stop.
*  White hits a three crowd goes nuts.
*  So you knew they were probably going to win at that point.
*  103, 89 with three minutes left.
*  And yet somehow 103, 98 with a minute 15 left.
*  Dallas gets a stop, watched it comes back down and wait, who is basically the
*  greatest shopwalking guard since Michael Jordan.
*  I don't even know.
*  I don't even know.
*  But, but once again, makes a great thing.
*  And they, they were saying afterwards, like apparently Jalen did a slight shove.
*  I thought the refs missed a bunch of shit on both sides in this game.
*  I just didn't think the refs were awesome.
*  Um, and I don't think it really hurt either team.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I don't think it benefited or hurt anybody.
*  They just, there were missed calls.
*  There were guys getting shoved.
*  Um, I thought the game had like a weird flow to it, partly because of the refs.
*  Um, yeah, it was physical.
*  It was definitely, I'd rather be physical.
*  I'd rather be that way than the mistakes.
*  Um, it just depends on who you're rooting for and you're only going to pay attention
*  to the calls that when it gets your team, you're never going to look at it the other
*  way saying like, oh, that probably should have been called.
*  That was kind of a gift there.
*  Why did they call travel there?
*  But not on one of the other guys.
*  I just thought there were a lot of moments where like, what the fuck was that?
*  Um, I would, I would give you two.
*  When Tatum drove in the first half and looked like he ran into a brick wall and
*  it was just like a tackling session at the rim.
*  I was like, wait, they call that on the floor.
*  Oh yeah.
*  That's right.
*  That one was like, wait, what?
*  Yeah.
*  You know, when the players are just looking at each other and complete
*  confusion, you know, it's a bad call.
*  Everybody was confused and then I'll give you one for Dallas.
*  And it got fouled.
*  Right.
*  I'll give you one for Dallas.
*  I actually think there's a few in the second half where if you were Boston,
*  you probably get the memo at some point, like you can probably do whatever you
*  want at the rim right now.
*  You do whatever you want.
*  And there was that Tatum one is what was weird because they called the foul, but
*  they didn't want to give them the free throws.
*  I thought at the other end, it was like, no layup was safe.
*  No layup was safe.
*  The way it can be another one's real.
*  It's like, you could just, you can kind of get into it a little bit and, and
*  some contact to the rim up high up low, but they're going to let you play.
*  Tony brothers getting worn out by the crowd, the home crowd bill.
*  They were letting Tony B have it.
*  Listen, Tony B took some abuse.
*  The Kyrie sucks chance were, uh, consistent and there were some jokes about Lucas.
*  Wait, I'm just going to be honest.
*  Uh, guy in my guy in my section told him he looked fat and Luca turned around
*  and told him to go home.
*  It was an actual exchange that happened in the third quarter.
*  Yeah.
*  The one I liked the most and I don't know if it's true, but I kind of wanted to be
*  true.
*  There was a big Kyrie sucks chant going on when Kyrie lined up on the free throw
*  line outside of Horford.
*  So he was taking the big man spot and Kyrie kind of like looked back and he
*  just, he can't help himself.
*  Like he gives these state of the Kyrie addresses constantly and they're fucking
*  so boring and Horford.
*  You're right.
*  After the first free throw, the chant died down a little bit and then Horford
*  kind of were like, no, let's keep these going.
*  Yeah.
*  And I went, he did that for the Gafford free throws too.
*  Yeah.
*  Horford's Horford's a little bit.
*  He'll, he'll go to the end zone section and he'll try to, try to uplift them.
*  Kyrie probably has the most at stake.
*  The rest of the series on Dallas.
*  I mean, I, you know, I think Tatum, the Celtics are in a good spot.
*  If they win the title, there'll be some nitpicking, but ultimately, Hey, he
*  was the best guy in the final statement.
*  How much are you going to say the Kyrie after the two week Kyrie celebration
*  about that, this was one of the great offensive players of all time.
*  And he has 28 points in two games.
*  And by the way, is averaging 22 in the playoffs.
*  And I was making this point last week to you that Jaylen Brown for the last four
*  years has been a better score in the playoffs than Kyrie and Jaylen Brown's
*  been a better score this year.
*  And Jaylen Brown has outscored him in both games.
*  And, you know, I just think sometimes there's certain players and it doesn't
*  matter what the sport is where your eyes tell you that they're better than the
*  actual results and Kyrie, this is who he's been the last six, seven years, the
*  guy from the 16 and 17 playoffs, who was 27, 30 a game consistently and was
*  unstoppable, I don't think he's the same guy anymore.
*  I think he's still a really good offensive player against certain
*  matchups and certain teams, but I think you can take them out.
*  Well, I thought the defense on him was terrific, but I also think he just had
*  moments where he wasn't playing in any kind of system.
*  He was like, I'm going to make some of these ridiculous shots because he's
*  capable, so I can't really ever blame him for wanting to do that stuff.
*  But I thought every time he decided like, okay, it's my possession.
*  It just, it becomes easier to defend, not to stay in front of Kyrie necessarily,
*  but everybody else is like, okay, well, what are you going to do, buddy?
*  You going down there?
*  We, between your legs a little bit like, oh, you're going to go do this.
*  You know what it is?
*  It's sports movie offense.
*  It's you're watching the sports movie and the other guy on the other team's
*  like, they're, they're talking shit and the cameras next to the two guys, they're
*  talking, she's like, okay, and he starts going through his legs, trying to beat
*  them up the dribble.
*  It's like above the rim.
*  Eric needs it above the rim.
*  That's really good.
*  Kind of the offense that he has.
*  And it's not in the flow of anything and nobody else is involved.
*  You know, he's getting 50 now in game three, as we talk about this, right?
*  I don't think there's a scenario where he gets 50 against the Celtics team.
*  I think it would have to be a seven overtime game.
*  What about the mind calculator?
*  I'll tell you this.
*  I w I was in, uh, I was in, you know, I'm in Boston.
*  I went on Fandel and I did just for fun.
*  I did a parlor, like a same game parlay, which actually hit.
*  Look at you.
*  Um, but one of the things was Kyrie all adjusted under 25 points.
*  Cause I just think it's going to be really hard for him to get 25 points.
*  You know what else I put in there in that, that same gamer, the Derrick white block.
*  Derrick white block one block every game for Derrick white is like minus one 60.
*  It's like the lock of the playoffs every game.
*  He gets a block every game.
*  It's like guaranteed.
*  He's going to have an awesome block at some point in the four quarters today.
*  He had two, but he had that like Kyrie went for the layup on him and he stayed
*  up in the air and kept his hand up and blocked it guys.
*  I've never seen a guard block like he's like six, two,
*  and then drew is probably one of the other great shop blocking guards.
*  I, you know what I love about Drew is how good he's at.
*  And I know he's always kind of done this, but maybe it just feels like he's
*  doing it against bigger and bigger players, like seeing him do it against
*  Cleveland, seeing him hit that, that layup against Siakam, the number of
*  trip on fake lefty layup.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  The number of times he gets the biggest guys who are just right in front of
*  them going, there's no way you're going to get this shot off against me and he
*  can't go to Ben, go to your son and say, Hey, look, lock of the century of the
*  week, it's these Derrick white block one block again, going over.
*  So like you are going to either SC or you're going to Bridgewater.
*  What do you want to do?
*  No offense to Bridgewater state.
*  I had a lot of buddies that went there, played linebacker for one semester.
*  You know, another thing I love about Drew is watching him.
*  Only a couple of guys can do this.
*  Hopping the screen where the guy kind of sticks the leg out a little bit and he
*  can hop around the screen, but stay in front of the dude.
*  And it's just like watching.
*  I don't know.
*  It's like watching like a Kung Fu movie or something.
*  He jumps sideways, but then goes backwards and he just keeps his position.
*  You're like, how did, how did he do that?
*  I was like that move Kyrie had in game one when he beat Horford on the
*  baseline, I was like, how did he just do that?
*  I don't even understand how he got by him.
*  Uh, Edwards was doing that in the Denver series too, with Murray, where he would
*  hop by these yogurt screens and somehow stay coordinated the list of guys who
*  could do that is not long, right?
*  Caruso can do it.
*  Um, so short.
*  Sugs fighting over screens was one of my, my highlights of the season.
*  One of the things I always think is kind of funny, like afterwards when these
*  teams and the Pacers did it and I like Carlisle, but the whole 78 missed calls
*  and games, one in game two, like, okay, cool.
*  And then of course my all time favorite was the Darrell Maury referendum after
*  his team couldn't make a fucking shot.
*  And when you watch the games live in the number of times we were like, okay, they
*  have to let all of this stuff go or to be sitting here for four hours.
*  But guys were chucking other dudes into screens tonight.
*  There was some stuff that was happening on the cleaning.
*  Like, like was shoveling Porzingis five feet.
*  I was watching going like, this doesn't seem normal.
*  And then lively would actually get involved with it.
*  And I think both teams were doing it, but it depended kind of, you know, your
*  perspective throughout where that would be the whole point if you wanted to
*  release some sort of official manifesto.
*  By the way, I'm on the official side as I build to this point is how do you count
*  those? Do you just count every single time something physical happened against
*  one of your guys away from the ball?
*  And you're like, Hey, don't stop until you get to 60 in fractions.
*  Like awesome.
*  Cause it just way easier to do.
*  That's why whenever that stuff happens, I'm like, I don't care.
*  I don't care what your count was.
*  Cause I know you're not counting the other ones.
*  Well, it's the old Chris Paul move of just start doing it in the first three
*  minutes of the game.
*  And as soon as they never call it, then you're good.
*  Now you can do it 50 times, right?
*  You just club dudes on the side as they're dribbling up.
*  He was the master at it.
*  Um, big picture.
*  I'm going to give you two bets that are on Fandral right now.
*  Well, I'll give you three Celtics sweep plus two 70 Celtics in five plus one 75
*  Celtics and six plus four 90 or Celtics and seven plus four 90 are just the
*  Boston winning the final spits.
*  Which one of those seems, if I had to, if I told you the series was going to go
*  seven or four, what would you pick?
*  I pick seven.
*  So you think Dallas can fire back.
*  So you're expecting a big, but you gave me a three or seven.
*  I never think anyone's going to get swept.
*  I never do.
*  Cause I just think human nature kicks in too often.
*  I still am a little surprised that you can get Boston plus points because it's
*  a bad matchup for Dallas.
*  It just is for all the different reasons we talk about a whole thing.
*  We knew it would be a bad matchup.
*  I just figured that Boston would have this game and they'd lose this one and
*  they'd be going back to Dallas one one.
*  But Boston, I would pick the sweep over the seven just because Boston hasn't
*  really played that well yet and they're up to nothing and they could have the
*  game or they just, you don't think they played well in game two, dude.
*  They were up 58, 29 and they cut, cut to eight with like, they were to go.
*  They gave up a 29 to nine run in game one though.
*  I can't say they played awesome.
*  Like that came.
*  I think, I think they played awesome.
*  Other than the close of the first half into the first eight minutes of the third
*  quarter, and that was the only part of the game Boston didn't know.
*  What did they shoot from three in that game?
*  They were 38% game one.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  But they haven't had the game because they do this once a week where they have
*  the game where they're like 22 for 40 from three, one of those, my point is they
*  haven't had one of those games yet when it's just like NBA NBA gym flames shooting
*  out on the flip side, Kyrie hasn't had a good game yet.
*  So if you're a Mavs fan, that's what you're banking on.
*  And I think that's it.
*  I think if he doesn't have a good game in the series, they're going to get swept.
*  I don't think they can win any of these games.
*  If he doesn't play well, if he's going to have 16, 12, 14, 17, 18, like
*  that's just not going to be enough.
*  Unless they do the, let's turn this into the mid two thousands finals.
*  Let's make these 92 to 89 super physical.
*  Let's go that route, slow it down.
*  Cause they tried to play fast.
*  I thought in the first half, you could see they were trying to get in their actions
*  faster, especially with Kyrie trying to speed up what they were doing offensively.
*  And it worked for about a quarter.
*  And then the Celtics caught up with the pace on it and it didn't work after that.
*  Especially just started missing threes.
*  I don't think it's sustainable for Luca to be having to defend as much as he is
*  more so than against Minnesota.
*  And then also when Kyrie's not going to show up and no one else is going to make any
*  shots, the corner threes are non-existent.
*  There's no law for us.
*  It was against Minnesota.
*  It's like, Hey, Luca, can you get 60 and we hope they miss a million shots.
*  Tonight has to be, I just left the arena going.
*  Like, I can't believe if I'm not, if I'm a Dallas fan, be like they bossed it, like
*  three of the bad things all in the same game.
*  And they still won.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, maybe, maybe Jason Kidd could say he thinks Peyton Pritchard is the best player
*  and then the Celtics will play him more.
*  Cause this may not be a Peyton Pritchard series.
*  They ran a play that they've ran a couple of times this year at the end of the
*  third quarter and it worked and he banked a running three in.
*  That was a huge momentum shift.
*  And then did the Peyton Pritchard thing, which I love when he does it.
*  Started doing that.
*  That's what I do.
*  Coming back to the bench and high-fiving everybody because it was a set play and
*  he actually scored, he did bank the three in, but I'm not sure if that was intentional
*  or not.
*  I just feel like every minute that he's out there, granted, he only took two shots
*  tonight, but you know, he was O a seven in the first game.
*  He, uh,
*  Yeah.
*  And then he transferred it.
*  He did the, it follows and he transferred the evil being to Hauser.
*  Can we predict, uh, Jason Kidd?
*  Jason kid mind game move for between game two, game three.
*  No bigs.
*  Hardy, Josh Green, Luca, PJ Kyrie.
*  There's nothing he could say to the media though.
*  He's got 72 hours here.
*  Uh, I don't know.
*  It sounds like you may have something cooking.
*  What do you think I'll do?
*  Probably a lot, probably something about the officiating and some things he didn't
*  like probably planting the seeds on how they're defending Kyrie or something like
*  that.
*  That would be my guess.
*  Um, the other move is talking about how they need to be more physical in the
*  finals, especially when you get to this level, it's going to be a war and we're
*  not showing enough fight.
*  He's going to do like the kind of prodding his way through the game.
*  Kind of prodding his dudes to just be basically knocked the Celtics around a
*  little bit and see, yeah, it's a pretty, it's a pretty, uh, you know, mellow
*  Celtics team for the most part, maybe try to, uh, intimidate them a little bit.
*  It would be a move and kid love, you know, he was on those nets teams that were,
*  uh, put with Kmart, uh, with tumblehead, the elbows, but I could, I could that
*  Dallas in 2011 was one of those teams, right?
*  He might call us on Marion.
*  He might, he might say, Hey PJ, you're missing.
*  Yeah.
*  Derek Jones, you're missing.
*  Like we need to get lively involved with a kind of read.
*  And I doubt he's going to go.
*  I don't think you go at Kyrie.
*  I think it's a constant massaging thing where you show how appreciated he is.
*  Kyrie, you're doing great.
*  Please, Kyrie.
*  Uh, and you're just not going to mess with Luca cause it's not like, unless you
*  want to do like the coach's son thing where you yell at the coach's son to get
*  the out of shape kid to pay attention.
*  Who's picking his nose.
*  Um, you're not going to say anything to him.
*  Do you think he does that?
*  I saw some guys who were afraid to shoot.
*  I saw some guys who were afraid to protect the rim.
*  Cleebus arms might not work.
*  That might be the reason he's not shooting, but I would, the
*  cleaver one really stood out.
*  Here would be a good one.
*  I thought the two toughest guys in the game where there are two guards, cause
*  then it's insulting his team, but it's also kind of a backhand and compliment
*  to some of the Celtics.
*  But he says Prichard and Hauser.
*  Then it really gets cranked up a bit.
*  Uh, I, uh, I'm excited to see where this goes.
*  Well, it's, it's just a classic, just a classic 2024.
*  So like they could sweep and they could finish 80 and 20 and people
*  like, ah, Tatum shot 36%.
*  It's just one of those teams.
*  Is he a superstar?
*  You know what?
*  He's the finals MVP, but is he good?
*  So far that would be the most fitting thing ever.
*  They win game three.
*  Luca is not active for game four Boston sweeps.
*  They're in Dallas.
*  Play anyone.
*  Tatum shoots like 29%.
*  They would have lost in Denver.
*  Jaylen wins.
*  And then local radio is immediately being like, do you have to trade one of them?
*  Now?
*  Do you actually have to trade Tatum?
*  Can these guys coexist?
*  They'll be duck boats and people are still going to be like, huh?
*  I don't know.
*  Let's see.
*  How many teams should they have lost to if the injuries hadn't worked out for them?
*  Should they have lost to Milwaukee?
*  Dang.
*  There's one Denver.
*  If they just had it screwed up game seven, there's two just go through.
*  Yeah.
*  That, I mean, look, they figured out something with the math and they figured
*  out the switch ability on defense and the fact that their best players don't have
*  to be awesome when they're playing.
*  They're not going to be able to win close playoff games.
*  Which is something that a lot of other teams cannot say.
*  How about we do this though, for just a second.
*  If they weren't able to look, pull this off.
*  It looks pretty good so far.
*  I think most people would agree.
*  They're tender.
*  So it looks solid.
*  Yeah.
*  The run of injuries and look, a lot of teams have injuries that happen in their
*  paths.
*  This was more exaggerated because it was just all of these guys all over the East.
*  Right.
*  You could really start making the list longer.
*  Although I don't know how Brunson's broken hand is on the Celtics somehow, but
*  there has to be some, no one's really going to do this, but if they were to win
*  the whole thing, Bill, I think there's also like a fair conversation that's
*  actually complimentary of the Celtics being like, Hey, you know what?
*  When they decided to flip their tough guy, Marcus smart, right.
*  For Prezengis in this deal, when they traded the heart and soul of the team.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Heart and soul team.
*  I don't see a lot of those pieces anymore.
*  When they traded knee Smith for Brogdon that led to the win, they were
*  that led to drew a little bit later.
*  Like the Celtics built real depth.
*  They built incredible depth with people that could be trusted.
*  So is it their fault that they had more depth than some of these other teams?
*  And of course, like no Janus and be constantly being a question mark in all
*  of these different games, Halliburton going down Mitchell.
*  Like I'm not trying to tell you this was tough.
*  I do think that there's a positive though, on the other side, it's completely
*  ignored with valid criticism about the opponents.
*  But the compliment should be, Hey, the front office, like think about how
*  great of a job Brad Stevens has done here.
*  And it almost feels like this weird afterthought because Ains had
*  drafted the other two guys.
*  Yeah.
*  The KP and drew trades, the common and Asia those, and the ball, I think
*  the Brogdon thing and then Derek white.
*  Like to go, the balls, the balls to trade smart and how that went over in
*  Boston and how upset people were about it.
*  And just like people, you and I talked to about Bassmar, like they traded smart.
*  That was crazy.
*  Why'd they do that?
*  And, you know, it led to a bunch of good stuff.
*  The drew trade was, I think more logical, but, um, being able to build a
*  sustainable contender, but then that's fine, but you, you don't want to end up
*  like, okay, see from 2009 to 2016 either.
*  So the finals would erase that.
*  Um, it would be their first title in eight, in, uh, in 16 years.
*  Yeah.
*  16 years.
*  Um, but it's an amazing success story with really what goes back to trading
*  Garnett and Pierce in the first place.
*  If it happens doing that trade, which leads to the Tatum Brown picks
*  and then doing the second ones.
*  And over and over again, they were proactive in the right times, which,
*  you know, I think you could say the same about Dallas.
*  Um, but I do think, I think whatever happens the rest of the way people
*  are going to talk about, it'll be a yeah, but title.
*  I'm just, I know it's, it's how it's going to go.
*  It's going to be a yeah, but you were pretty fair about the Lakers bubble
*  title, so I, I know, I know you would hope for the same fairness.
*  Well, I'll tell you this.
*  I'm waiting to see how LeBron interjects himself into the finals this week.
*  And I think it's going to be effusive praise about drew holiday, how he's the
*  one guy in the league he always wanted to play with followed by some sort of
*  story about how he was pushing the Lakers hard to trade firm and Palenka
*  didn't get it done or something, but LeBron knew that drew was, he knew
*  this was going to happen.
*  I could see that because last week I thought he played the Kyrie thing really well.
*  That's good.
*  What he wouldn't give to have Kyrie again.
*  No, that's good.
*  Be like, I can't believe the Celtics ended up with true.
*  That was my number one target.
*  I, I tried to tell everyone that's what we should get.
*  Be a good one.
*  Um, all right, we're going to, uh, we're going to take a break and then we're
*  going to throw it to the other part of the podcast, which, um, we taped earlier
*  in the afternoon and it's very enjoyable and has a lot of NBA talk in it.
*  Celtics up too well, unless you have any other stories from the crowd or any, uh,
*  Boston stuff that you saw tonight.
*  I saw nothing.
*  You know what I like that they're doing?
*  They had char as the hero among us in game one and then, uh, Matthew Slater
*  today for game two, I like bringing out the popular athletes.
*  They really, I thought supercharged the crowd.
*  I thought that was cool.
*  And in general, I thought the energy in there was great.
*  It's just so funny that there was 10 points during the game where the crowd was
*  like, the roof's going to come off.
*  Uh, miss three roofs ready to come off.
*  Ah, mislay up.
*  And they just could never get over the hump and make this, this awesome.
*  Game, but maybe it'll happen.
*  And it had to be louder game one, right?
*  Yeah.
*  The KP, the, uh, the KP stretch when it went from whatever tie game to 37 20 was
*  the loudest I can remember it being since, um, you know, probably two years ago.
*  Or maybe I wasn't at the Tate and Philly game.
*  I got something for you.
*  I, oh, you weren't for that there for that one.
*  That was probably wasn't at the game seven, but I heard that was a really good
*  crap.
*  I think they've done a really good job making all the stuff right around the
*  court feel more packed than ever before.
*  Like, I just remember there was more space and now that there's very little
*  space, which doesn't make it easy to navigate.
*  It feels like there's just extra rows now and it just fills in in a way.
*  I don't remember it when I used to live here, but maybe, I don't know, maybe I'm
*  just older and I feel more crowded.
*  Um, I went up and did the Celtics pregame show with Scal and house and Tom.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh my God.
*  So you want to hear some money?
*  So it was great.
*  So I walked up and there was just this one angle of me to be able to like get
*  through the crowd and then just go to security guy.
*  And I didn't even look at who was at the desk and there's this pretty put together.
*  You could tell like former law enforcement guy, white guy, older than me.
*  And he looks at me cause I'm like kind of coming up to be like, Hey, you know, I
*  think I'm going on here soon.
*  Can I get through it?
*  The guy's like, I don't know who you are and I don't know what you're talking about.
*  I was like, I'm totally okay with you.
*  I don't expect anybody to know, but the producers are right over there and I'm
*  in the next block and they want me in.
*  And then he like was looking at me and then I look and realize that he's
*  Adam Silver's bodyguard.
*  So he saw me like kind of beeline towards the set and thinking, why is this guy
*  like walking so aggressively, like in a straight line and then being like, Hey,
*  I'm, I'm going up there.
*  And there was like a back area, but I wasn't, people can pretend, but like, I'm
*  never rude in those situations.
*  I never expect anybody to know anything, even though I, you know, had this big
*  badge on and he's like, look, I'm here with Adam Silver, like I'm not, I don't
*  know what you're talking about, who you are or who the other guy is or whatever.
*  I'm here for Adam.
*  And then I kind of like put it all together and we both put it together and I
*  go, Hey, you must've thought like, what is this guy doing?
*  Because this is exactly what I thought.
*  He thought he was like, you're like an assassin.
*  Yeah.
*  I was like, I can't believe Seattle's gone.
*  So,
*  not expand for most.
*  In the moment, he's like, I can't believe you left Clark off the Olympic team.
*  He's like, dude, that's a different commissioner.
*  That's different.
*  It's not Adam.
*  That wasn't Adam.
*  So then it was just this awesome moment of like both of us laughing.
*  I was like, you must've thought he was like, I was ready to tackle you.
*  And I was like, I did not want to be tackled.
*  And then the producer comes over and he's like, Ryan, we're over here.
*  We're over here.
*  So Adam silver, your guy is on it.
*  And then was also like what I love with people that are in some
*  sort of authoritative position.
*  Cause granted those people can have terrible attitudes because they're
*  dealing with so many assholes, especially at something like this, a big event.
*  We had this moment of like relief where it was, Oh yeah.
*  Like I was wondering what your deal was.
*  And I could see why you would think I was in charge of this whole set
*  because I'm security.
*  I'm in front of the entrance and we all worked it out, man.
*  And then I said hi to Adam.
*  And then I went on and it's pretty funny because scowl, Eddie, myself
*  debated Tatum Brown and I was like, look, I don't want to do this.
*  Jalen Brown's game one's probably one of my all time favorite Jalen Brown games.
*  I loved it, but Tatum's a better player and Eddie probably wanted
*  me there for the post game.
*  Is there an alternate universe where you just live here and you're like
*  battling Felger on some different station and doing the Celtics pregame
*  post game and really enjoying them fucking shit out of it.
*  Would you want to do it for like a year?
*  No.
*  Okay.
*  Meaning that do you think about it sometime?
*  It would be a fun.
*  Do you like to do that?
*  Do you ever do the alternative choose your own adventure, Bill Simmons stuff?
*  No, it's just like, you never do that.
*  You never think like, Hey, if this didn't happen or this didn't happen.
*  No, I'm saying like right now, would it just be fun to do it for a year?
*  Oh, if I'm doing anything fun for a year.
*  No, I'm getting league pass in St.
*  Bart's and I'm doing like a boat thing on the weekend.
*  That's the closest I would be.
*  Are you going to Harallabob?
*  Uh, no, I can't afford Harallabobs.
*  Division, Division three St.
*  Bart's basketball team.
*  No, no, no.
*  I mean like St.
*  Bart's and then get better at boating and then just keep, keep doing this.
*  Like I had a, it was probably cause my buddy and I had had a few drinks,
*  but we were doing like, he was like, what could you do right now?
*  Cause he's got kids or driving crazy.
*  And he was like, could you do this?
*  And I went, yeah, I think I could do that.
*  And then he was like throwing basically it was a list of like seven different
*  things of like, could you do this?
*  And I was like, yeah, I probably could do that.
*  He's like, come on.
*  And then it was just like over and over and over again.
*  He just kept, he also could just be a bartender at Barney's
*  Beanery for like five days a week.
*  Not at Barney's, but there was, there was talk.
*  Like being at beach maybe.
*  Yeah.
*  There was, there's been a few jokes about, would you actually do
*  like a Sunday shift here?
*  Like non, non NFL season.
*  I couldn't do it in NFL season.
*  I mean, the amount of work we have to do on Sundays, but then could I do like
*  Thursday nights, maybe during the NBA season, what I want to, would I have my towel?
*  So now you're talking Kyle's language.
*  Right.
*  Maybe, maybe it'd be better if I owned a place and I was like, Hey, the
*  owner's here on Thursdays, he checks the register.
*  See that sounds like a sitcom.
*  Podcaster who's yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  I feel like they're an NBC, NBC replacement schedule.
*  Right.
*  Can that work?
*  First out, he opens a bar.
*  What if you made it more like the bear where it was like, cool.
*  We've got Tofer grace.
*  He's interested.
*  What a great setup with the bear.
*  When the guy's like, I thought you were dead.
*  He's like, no, that's my brother.
*  It's just such a good line in that show where he's like selling stuff.
*  The guy's like, not you dad.
*  He's like, no, no.
