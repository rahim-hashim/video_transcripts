# Knicks Venting Session After Maxey Steals Game 5 | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYcQCUpeopQ)
*  One of the most improbable playoff losses I can ever remember.
*  And we'll see if it matters, Sean, because sometimes these happen.
*  And then the team wins the series anyway, and it just becomes a blip.
*  And hopefully for your sake and the sake of the Knicks fans, that's going to happen.
*  But that was about as improbable and a crazy of a loss as I've seen.
*  Walk us through what you're feeling.
*  Well, as you know, I don't actually have a lot of experience with the loss like that.
*  The Knicks just have not had a lot of gut wrenching playoff losses in the last 30 years.
*  You know, they've obviously had a few in the mid 90s that were devastating.
*  But when those were happening, I was like 12 years old.
*  It takes me back.
*  It takes me back to Charles Smith.
*  You know, it takes me back to those painful moments when you felt like it was within your grasp.
*  This one's a little tough because I really want this Sixers team to be burned alive.
*  Like, I really hate them.
*  And I just really want this series to be over.
*  And there's a part of there's a sick part of me that's just like, you know what?
*  Go to the second round.
*  If you win against Pacers, great.
*  If you lose, fine.
*  But I have just grown to despise and be in awe of Tyrese Maxey.
*  And I just don't want to have to see him anymore.
*  I'm just sick of it.
*  So I'm feeling really sad and also kind of just stunned and unable to get my head around what just happened.
*  Plus, so Europe 106 100, there's less than 30 seconds left timeout and they're cutting to everybody in the crowd.
*  And it's just like the craziest mixture of famous New York fan celebs and then actual people who played at the Knicks.
*  Anywhere the camera is going, there's just like three more people like, oh him, oh those guys.
*  And it just felt like, holy shit to have this game and game two.
*  The Knicks are officially alive.
*  And then in a heartbeat, it changed.
*  Yeah, there was a moment, I think it was at like 59 seconds when they went up six and there was a cutaway to the crowd.
*  And you saw LJ, you saw Spree and you saw Starks and you saw Patrick Ewing sitting down and people reaching over and like grabbing him by the shoulder and clutching him.
*  And I was sitting there with my three year old and I was like, that's Patrick Ewing.
*  This is the Knicks.
*  Like it was a really like a genuine emotional moment.
*  And I never would have thought, I shouldn't say that.
*  I felt confident that they were going to win the game.
*  And the way that they let it slip through their fingers is just maddening.
*  I mean, I, you know, I actually don't know.
*  I could recount every single moment that just happened, but each one that happened had to happen for it to become a bad loss.
*  No, you know, like in the grand scheme of things, you're right.
*  They're up three, two, they were up three, one.
*  I think they've basically outplayed and out hustled the Sixers this entire series and I expect them to do the same thing in game six, but just replaying that last minute in my head.
*  It like, I feel like I'm getting a migraine.
*  Like it hurts very, very hard.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause Maxi made, he made a couple of shots when it felt like you had the game, but then the 106, 100 less than 30 seconds left timeout, 28.2 left, which is I think the exact same time of heat spurs.
*  Game six, 2019, I think was also 28.2.
*  I'm not positive, but I'm like 99% positive.
*  The Ray Allen shot.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, it was, it was the plays that led up to the Ray Allen shot.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Um, they come out of the timeout and Robinson's out there, which I just thought was weird because at that point you just have to have guards and small forwards and everybody's switching on everything.
*  So they set a pick on him and he comes back around and fouls Maxi and they're like, Oh, that's two.
*  His foot was on the line.
*  They showed the replay.
*  It wasn't the random four point place.
*  So now you have the LJ four point play energy.
*  It's suddenly in the game.
*  It goes from six points to two.
*  And that was one.
*  And then the other was Maxi then hits the second one after the heart miss free throw reminiscent of the Ray Allen game where, you know, man who had to miss the free throw to basically get a go and then Kawhi missed a free throw.
*  Um, but the maxi two threes reminiscent of the Reggie Miller hit the two threes in the playoff game game.
*  So you dip back into Nick's history for two of the craziest Nick playoff games at MSG ever.
*  And it both happens in 25 seconds.
*  Uh, on all of my text chains, the Mitchell Robinson point is, is percolating hard right now because he honestly was great in the final five minutes of the game leading up to that final minute.
*  He was denying the entry on Embiid.
*  He forced a bunch of turnovers.
*  He was knocking the ball loose left and right.
*  He played really well.
*  He's obviously not 100 percent.
*  But in that situation, I even would rather just have Hardenstein out there.
*  I think he is a better option in a situation like that because he's just more limber and he's like, he's not going to make a lurching foul like that.
*  And I mean, credit to Maxi, he's just a, he's just a sorcerer tonight.
*  I mean, he was unbelievable.
*  He was like a, he was like the road runner out there.
*  Like no one could catch him.
*  He was hitting crazy shots.
*  Um, and yeah, it did feel, it felt karmic for game two.
*  You know, obviously a lot of things broke their way game two.
*  And then there has been some crazy luck in the Knicks direction and some crazy luck against the Knicks over the years in games like this.
*  The garden with one minute left, that seemed as crazy as it was ever going to be.
*  And then by the end of regulation, I, that's got to be as much as the wind has ever been taken out of their sails.
*  Like, I don't, did anybody see that, that, that series coming?
*  Maxi finishes with 46 and the two threes he makes, he scores seven points in the last 28 seconds on two
*  possessions, which is basically impossible.
*  I don't even know if that's happened before in a big playoff game.
*  I'd be interested.
*  I know that they can run all the numbers, but just somebody's going seven points on two possessions to tie a game.
*  I'd be interested to see if that happened before.
*  The second three, the second three is really hard to accept though, because the move was obviously to foul there and to not get a foul on that situation.
*  It's just, it's a blunder.
*  I don't know if that's Tibbs' fault or if they just couldn't execute or what happened, but he should never be able, I mean, it was an amazing
*  35 foot three pointer from the top of the key, but he shouldn't be taking that shot.
*  It shouldn't allow that to happen.
*  And they did.
*  Well, but that's what's crazy about those two threes.
*  The first one he's completely off balance getting fouled and just heaves it up and it goes in.
*  But those are the ones like those never go in.
*  And then the second one, he shoots it cause he doesn't want to get fouled.
*  And I'm going to say that was a 32 footer, but that's about as great with, when you're talking about your seasons on the line, basically, and you have to make it.
*  That's up there.
*  If they win the series, that will go up there with one of the great shots.
*  Just cause like I was watching on Twitter, they ran the other day, they ran Jerry West made that shot in the 1970 finals to busher scores in LA with like five seconds left.
*  And the Lakers inbound it.
*  They don't have any timeouts and West just is like, I guess I'll just have to make this 65 footer or whatever it was.
*  And he just makes it.
*  The maxi thing was a little like that.
*  Cause if he misses that the season's over and he buried it, it's not like it bounced around.
*  It was like swish.
*  Well, it also, he did it with like eight and a half seconds on the clock.
*  So just from a strategic perspective, like it was crazy cause he was trying to avoid getting fouled, but he also left a lot of time on the clock.
*  There could have been a big rebound bouncing, kicking out, giving them another opportunity.
*  And I will say the Sixers after getting their asses kicked on the boards, all series kind of outworked the Knicks in the second half of this game.
*  The Knicks were not good at rebounding in the second half.
*  But anyway, he hits that shot and he still have a chance.
*  And Brunson is blazing down the court with eight seconds left and he just gets a shot blocked at the end of regulation.
*  I didn't love that last possession.
*  Did you have a timeout left or no?
*  I don't remember.
*  Yeah, I don't.
*  I didn't love that last shot.
*  I am poor Brunson ends up 15 for 32 is 40 points again and gets out outshined outshone.
*  Used to be an editor outshone or outshined.
*  I'll for the purposes of sound garden acknowledgement will say outshined.
*  So that's a great sound.
*  Great.
*  Yeah, it's outshined by Tyrese Maxey.
*  So I have two different things for you.
*  One is.
*  I just thought top my head, I did a tiny bit of research, but most improbable losses.
*  And I think this is different than craziest losses, comeback losses, great shots.
*  These are games that I specifically remember watching thinking the game was over and not even in the back of my head, thinking the other team was going to
*  come back.
*  So that Ray Allen shot we mentioned that's that game was a wrap.
*  They're putting the rope around the court.
*  Bird steals the ball was at that game.
*  He missed the shot.
*  Ball goes out of bounds.
*  Five seconds left and we're all devastated.
*  We think the game's over.
*  The Derek Fisher shot is a really underrated one for this because that swung who went to the finals.
*  And by the way, every, every shot of man give you somebody went to the finals.
*  Duncan makes a crazy like one legged.
*  I don't know if I can't remember if it was a three or a long two, but it goes in Lakers go.
*  They're down one with 0.4 seconds left, leading to that crazy Fisher shot that swings the series Lakers go on to lose to the Pistons.
*  But that was a good spurs team.
*  And then the Reggie Miller, two straight threes.
*  Where they're up six tied.
*  Then the foul, the offensive foul on Starks after the rebound and all of a sudden the Knicks are winning.
*  So here's the thing out of those other five, Maxie from the logo would be the six, but the other five, the team won the series.
*  If Max, if Philly doesn't win the series, I think this just becomes a really funny, it's been a classic game and that's it.
*  Yeah, we're it's a we're in prisoner of the moment territory right now.
*  Like this is the first round.
*  It just it just feels more consequential because the Knicks are never in this situation.
*  This has been an incredible series.
*  Every single game has been a barn burner.
*  I think the point differential for the entire series is plus two for the Sixers.
*  So that's just that just means that everything has been exciting about it.
*  It's just I've never seen it just like you.
*  I've never seen a guy score seven points in 28 seconds in the way that he did.
*  I mean, it was just it was remarkable and devastating.
*  And, you know, OJN and OB missed free throw.
*  Josh Hart missed free throw.
*  There was a terrible short armor.
*  The first one.
*  And it was his second short armor of the quarter.
*  He did something earlier in the quarter, too.
*  They missed a bunch of free throws.
*  Brunson was gassed.
*  He missed a free throw.
*  Like, you know, I can't I don't I can't not bring up Embiid, though,
*  who is just talk about it just like.
*  A punk bully bitch who I cannot believe is allowed to play in the NBA.
*  Him getting a flagrant foul up for with 90 seconds left in an overtime game
*  that's do or die is one of the corniest, the loosiest things I've ever seen.
*  Hitting a six foot guard in the face on a critical play in overtime.
*  Does he have brain damage?
*  Like, what the hell was that?
*  After after mailing in one of the most pathetic efforts
*  that I've ever seen from a superstar in a closeout game.
*  What a dickhead.
*  Like, what was that?
*  Well, like what six is going to be like?
*  That was cool. He hit Brunson in the face with up four.
*  That was awful.
*  That's a bad look for the league.
*  Yeah. How do you feel about it?
*  Are there are there people in Philadelphia right now who are like
*  Embiid is my favorite player?
*  Like, what what the fuck was that, Bill?
*  Well, I was monitoring this.
*  He had nine turnovers in the fourth quarter,
*  and then he had two more turnovers, but some have the numbers stated nine.
*  But I'm positive he had two more after I looked and it was nine.
*  He was seven for 19 for the game.
*  He played some good defense in the OT,
*  but he was so sloppy with the ball.
*  There were there were moments where I mean, it felt like he could have had
*  even more turnovers than he had.
*  And it just felt like this is one of the crazy things about this game.
*  If Philly just loses, if Maxi misses that chop from the logo.
*  That might have been Embiid's last game for the Sixers.
*  That might have been the end of the process.
*  There are all these like sliding door scenarios where
*  then then the spotlight's on him.
*  It's like, what the fuck was that game?
*  You had nine turnovers.
*  You made you made five shots.
*  What do you do in the OT?
*  He kind of got it back.
*  And now there now there could be a different narrative of that guy's a warrior.
*  He played hurt the whole game.
*  He came through in the OT.
*  He had some big defensive positions on Brunson.
*  But it felt like he had.
*  Basically had a fork in him until the Maxi seven pointer.
*  He did seem like he could really hold the ball in the fourth quarter.
*  He kept getting poked out of his hands in the final six minutes of the game.
*  He's obviously insanely talented.
*  And he did.
*  I mean, he rejected Brunson aggressively in OT on that one drive
*  that was pretty critical in the game.
*  But I don't know, like everything is just very stage managed with him.
*  You know, the alert that he had a migraine and he was questionable for the game
*  before the game, you know, putting out the Bell's palsy news
*  after he tugged at Mitchell Robinson's ankle like he's just a clown.
*  He's like a totally stage managed social media clown.
*  And he's a great player, of course.
*  But I just really, really hope they put them to bed in Philadelphia.
*  I really do, because I'm sick of hearing about him.
*  I hope this is the end of the process.
*  I'm sick of hearing about all of that crap.
*  I give it up completely to Tyrese Maxi, who is an amazing player
*  and like an unbelievable down the line superstar.
*  But I just I really have grown to despise and beat, as you know,
*  over the course of the last two weeks.
*  It's crazy that you don't you like him less than Kyle
*  Lowry, who's one of your least favorite athletes.
*  Well, there's no secret about that.
*  Like Kyle Lowry is not trying to be like, I'm the best guy in the league.
*  I'm a super nice guy.
*  Like he's a 38 year old veteran who's made his entire career on playing this way.
*  And beat is bigger than everybody and is literally hitting six foot
*  tall guys on the head.
*  Like what if you if a defensive end hits a quarterback on the head,
*  he's ejected from the game and suspended like this is what are we doing?
*  You know, Lowry had a good one.
*  Brunson was taking big free throws, I think at the end of regulation.
*  I can't remember, but Lowry used to do this in the Celtics, too.
*  So I was watching for it.
*  He's on the bench and right.
*  You know, it was when it was the flagrant when he had the two free throws
*  with nobody around and Larry's on the side.
*  And right as Brunson is about to shoot, Lowry
*  waves his hand, starts yelling instructions.
*  He's doing that thing.
*  It's like, oh, oh, you need to do this.
*  Literally right now on the first two free throws.
*  But that's the kind of shit he does.
*  He walks into people's sight lines like he's just all about the gamesmanship.
*  It didn't work in that case.
*  But the difference is, is if Lowry played for the Knicks, we would worship him.
*  And if he played for the Knicks, I would be disappointed.
*  Like, that's really where it's at.
*  Like, I really don't I don't want to root for somebody
*  who's basically picking on people with Lowry.
*  It's like he's trying to stay alive in the game.
*  Like he's using every trick in the book.
*  You know, it's annoying, obviously.
*  It's really hard to watch.
*  Well, one, I mean, he's just putting a number on
*  on Devo, like Devin Chenzo.
*  No one's really talking about this, but like he was their second
*  or third best offensive player for the last two months of the season.
*  He's averaged eight points a game in the series.
*  Like, he's not he has not done anything.
*  So he's obviously given them problems.
*  Three for Braves played really well, you know,
*  but who played really well today to Batum was was shadowing Brunson all game.
*  Like guys who are you don't really think about as serious playoff players
*  are playing really well in this series.
*  But yeah, I don't know.
*  I'm I've been making a sincere effort to not drink alcohol during the week.
*  This is something that I'm doing in my 40s.
*  And I immediately poured myself a tall glass of gin immediately after this game.
*  Nick's played seven guys today.
*  Deuce McBride played 33 minutes and is hit when he launches jumpers.
*  The entire crowd screams Deuce.
*  So congrats to him. He is the man.
*  No, but I don't have a job for the for the playoffs.
*  Randall's obviously gone.
*  Robinson's playing hurt.
*  He didn't play precious tonight and nobody else on the roster,
*  I guess, is going to play.
*  So this is it.
*  You're rolling with seven guys from now on.
*  And if the rotation is tough and the deep and change, I'll point is key
*  because he was the only other guy who could kind of create a shot himself.
*  OG can sort of try to do it, but it doesn't, you know,
*  and Deuce can do it if he's coming off a pick.
*  But you really felt it in the OT.
*  It was just like, all right, Jalen, one more time.
*  It's just the same play over and over and over and over again.
*  You know, I don't know if that's Jalen calling his number.
*  I assume it is.
*  You could feel that a little bit in the OT that he wasn't really
*  going to let anyone else shoot.
*  They weren't really working their offense.
*  They were only working the Jalen offense, which is a little hard to watch.
*  But also, if you just watched even Tenzo go for three for ten
*  for the fourth straight game, like, I'm not sure what other choice he has.
*  Oh, gee, I don't know.
*  Oh, gee, I was a little down on the first couple of games.
*  I felt like they needed to give him more.
*  He's been pretty damn good.
*  He had a couple of moments in the fourth quarter of this game
*  that were breathtaking, like he had the he had the garden in his hands.
*  At one point, I don't know.
*  They're just, you know, they're missing Randall.
*  Like you can just see that they're missing.
*  They're missing an offensive player.
*  They need a guy right now and they just don't have him.
*  And so it's going to be great.
*  The rain will be able to carry some of the load.
*  I was told Devin Booker wants to come.
*  And, you know, when I was on with you and Howard a few few weeks ago,
*  I think we were dream casting the potential that's been a rumor for four years.
*  I mean, his guys are running the Knicks, so everybody is.
*  We'll do that.
*  Let's do let's pick up Bogey's option.
*  We'll trade Bogey and three first rounders straight up for Booker.
*  Who's probably going to have to include some more stuff in that.
*  Deuce McBride, untouchable, Devo, untouchable, Josh Hart, untouchable,
*  Precious, untouchable, OG, untouchable, Jalen, untouchable, Mitch,
*  Isaiah Hardenstein, resigned.
*  So Bogey and picks, who says no, it's looking Durant ish.
*  I would say more. Maybe you're shopping in the Durant aisle.
*  So if you win this game, Brunson Mania goes up seven levels.
*  This becomes a legendary Knicks series.
*  Knicks are back.
*  We're taping this before the end of Indian and walk.
*  I assume Indiana is going to get to the next round.
*  Process is dead.
*  I don't know what happens to Embiid.
*  We talk about his near quadruple double.
*  That's one of the things that people remember about the game plus Brunson.
*  Darrell Moore, probably, I don't know what happens to him,
*  but it's probably not awesome considering Harden's peaking
*  for the Clippers right now.
*  And everything he got from that trade is basically Nick Batum.
*  He got, you know, a wing defender for James Harden and a pick,
*  which I support.
*  But I'm just saying right now, this moment, if I own the Sixers, I'd be like, hey,
*  what about when we traded that James Harden guy who was just killing Dallas
*  the other night?
*  Darrell should have been forced to walk the plank into the Hudson River
*  if they lost in five in New York.
*  Or at least sat with Latrell Spreewell.
*  And who's Latrell with?
*  He should have had a seat.
*  I think it was with LJ, right?
*  Yeah. But now everything flips and we'll see again.
*  What do you think's going to happen?
*  You're come on. You've seen this a million times.
*  What do you think is going to happen?
*  Do they spit the bit?
*  Here's my fear for you.
*  God damn it.
*  Sometimes in sports, when you hit rock bottom,
*  shout out to rock bottom month on the rewatchables, by the way, you did a couple.
*  When you hit rock bottom and it just seems bleak and it just seems like
*  the door is slammed shut on whatever era you're in, whatever season you're in.
*  And then something like truly crazy happens.
*  Sometimes it has a tendency to flip something.
*  And I'm wondering, you know, because I don't believe for like in basketball,
*  especially it's not like baseball, like we've seen baseball series
*  where somebody loses a game like this and they're just fucking shell
*  shock for the rest of the way and they can't come back from it.
*  Basketball, especially the three pointers, you can come back.
*  My fear is like something special is now happening with Maxey.
*  And this was the Brunson series.
*  And now we've moved into the Maxey series because you haven't really shown
*  you could defend him. So my guess would be you'd probably put OG on him, right?
*  I think they'd be afraid of the fouls, but he was even going by OG.
*  I mean, there's nobody on the team who can keep up with them.
*  I'm trying to. So are you saying that this game was our Manchester by the sea?
*  Like which which rock bottom month movie was this?
*  I think it's hardcore.
*  I think now you're at the point where you have to dress up like a porn producer
*  to change the momentum of it.
*  You just got to put a wig on and a tie dye shirt.
*  Devin Booker to come in and audition for the role.
*  Yeah, yeah. To guard on the New York Knicks.
*  But no, that's right.
*  That's my fear is that sometimes this will happen
*  where the rock bottom happens, miracle something, and then it flips.
*  But I think that would have to
*  a piece of that would have to be and be just playing better.
*  And not throwing the ball to the other team two to three times a quarter
*  and protecting the boards, which he did a little better job today.
*  And I thought, no, he he was a little energized defensively.
*  So does that continue? They put a lot of minutes on him.
*  When you playing again, is it Thursday night or Friday night?
*  I don't actually know.
*  I wasn't planning on having to watch on Thursday or Friday night.
*  You know, Thursday.
*  Yeah, Thursday night.
*  So two nights later, he's got to play.
*  But you put some miles in.
*  It's one of the most fascinating first round series we've had.
*  I mean, you talk about like start to finish the five games.
*  We're all really fun to watch.
*  I have no idea what's going to happen now.
*  And the next are both back and the Knicks are back.
*  Just we'll see which one we'll see which one counts really, really quickly.
*  If if the Knicks go to Philly and lose and then lose in Game Seven in New York,
*  do you think that that radically changes the future of what they like?
*  Will they panic and do something that significantly alters
*  what is clearly like one of the most beloved Knicks teams in decades?
*  Like this is my favorite team of the century right now.
*  And I worry that there would be an overreaction relative to this experience.
*  I don't think it changes whatever the plan was.
*  The plan was if we can get a superstar, we will.
*  That was going to happen whether they made the Eastern Finals or not.
*  I think the only thing that it might shift is maybe you're a little less
*  precious about keeping all three Villanova guys together.
*  I think if Diffin Chenzos is bad, the whole playoffs.
*  You know, and he's like the deal breaker in a trade to get somebody awesome.
*  Maybe maybe you don't blink in the same way on that one.
*  But, uh, you know, when you think like Randall out Bogdanovic,
*  your big trade deadline piece out.
*  Alec Burks, tragically tragically passed away.
*  Oh no, he's still alive.
*  He's just just by the sea to Alex versus demise.
*  Yeah, I don't know what happened to him.
*  Um, so I would say.
*  I don't think they would overreact to it, but the bummer would be, holy shit.
*  We had this amazing moment.
*  We had the next round coming where we were going to either play.
*  Probably Indiana or a Milwaukee team with the banged up Giannis.
*  And how did we squander this?
*  And then just, you know, we you've you've done this with sports.
*  I've done this with sports, these sequences where you just watch them
*  for the rest of your life going, how the fuck?
*  Why?
*  Like I'm still upset that McHale and Parrish didn't box out Kareem
*  in game four of the 87 finals.
*  I'm still upset.
*  It's 37 years later.
*  I'm still upset about it.
