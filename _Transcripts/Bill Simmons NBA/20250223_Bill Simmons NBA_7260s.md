# Do the Celtics Own the Knicks? Are the Lakers Actually Scary? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [February 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM)
*  It's another emotional year for us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=0.0s)]
*  Rossello Sundays with Rossello. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1.6s)]
*  We're back. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4.4s)]
*  We made it another basketball season to talk about, complain about breakdown. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4.96s)]
*  Plus we have a whole bunch of other things too. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=10.08s)]
*  We have the NFL drafts coming up. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=12.24s)]
*  Um, I'm sure you have some movie and music thoughts, maybe some Oscar thoughts, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  maybe some white lotus thoughts. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=18.72s)]
*  I never know what you're up to. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=20.0s)]
*  How are you? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=20.88s)]
*  I'm great. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  A lot of reading, a lot of history, beginning of civilization. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=22.88s)]
*  If you have any questions, we get to a movie, uh, after the basketball. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  Kiss. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=29.68s)]
*  I'm ready. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=29.919999999999998s)]
*  I'm going to talk some James poke. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=30.72s)]
*  Like, I don't know where you want to go. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=32.16s)]
*  No, I've just, um, I'm on this huge Susan wise Bauer kick, but again, I think we should table it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=34.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=41.28s)]
*  We'll save it for later. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=41.68s)]
*  I just went to Celtics, Knicks. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=42.64s)]
*  I have just the slew of thoughts. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=44.64s)]
*  We're watching the game. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=46.96s)]
*  I'm sitting with my dad and I just think the Knicks are a bad matchup for the Celtics. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=47.84s)]
*  And we're saying that the whole time. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  We're like, this team can't play with us. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  And the cells get up to like in the mid twenties, it's like 24, 26. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  And then the Knicks come roaring back. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=58.4s)]
*  They come roaring back, man, Brunson and Towns. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=60.24s)]
*  And we're watching like, should we be scared? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=63.6s)]
*  We should be scared. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  And then now it's like, it's nine and it's seven. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=65.84s)]
*  Then it's six. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=68.24s)]
*  But we slowly realized that tips has just left his starters in basically the whole game. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=69.2s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons they're hanging around. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=73.36s)]
*  And I'm, my dad's freaking out. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=75.52s)]
*  I'm like, no, this, there's no way towns. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=76.8s)]
*  Isn't going to play like 46 minutes. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=79.68s)]
*  Like we're, we're, we're fine. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=81.44s)]
*  And then the cells end up finishing up here. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=82.8s)]
*  Here's where I'll start with you. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=85.6s)]
*  Does tips know that the regular season, especially in the East doesn't really matter [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=87.44s)]
*  in that you just want to be one of the first four seeds and that to put miles, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=91.92s)]
*  like the miles that he put on some of his guys today is insanity. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=95.92s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=100.16s)]
*  I just don't understand it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  He doesn't care. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=103.68s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure he understands it in the brief time that I had access to him. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=104.48s)]
*  We were at ESPN together. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=108.32s)]
*  He's, he's so smart about basketball. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=109.6s)]
*  Like, I think I left the room just going, do I know anything? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=112.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=114.88s)]
*  Cause I mean, I've told the story before, but we were watching a game together. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=115.36s)]
*  And then it was an inbounds. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=118.64s)]
*  It was a simple inbounds play. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=120.16s)]
*  And I just went, what, what, and they ran through like seven different things that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=121.28s)]
*  you could do defending this inbound. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  And I just was like, Jesus, and look, this is what everybody says about him. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=127.6s)]
*  Uh, we know that he's brilliant, but yeah, he doesn't care. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  And I think when you looked at the earlier part of this week, because New York, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=133.2s)]
*  we know the record against the top three teams, Boston, OKC, uh, in Cleveland, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=136.64s)]
*  they're oh, and seven now. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=140.96s)]
*  But they played in Chicago on Thursday and it was an overtime game. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=142.72s)]
*  And here are the minutes, precious 46, McHale 44, cat 43, Brunson 38, McBride played 42. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=146.8s)]
*  And then he played three other guys, 17 minutes. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=154.88000000000002s)]
*  So they go into that Cleveland game fresh off of that where Cleveland, I think was [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  coming off of back to back and you could see within that game, you're like, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=162.4s)]
*  they're toast. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  Boston had the extra rest day. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=166.0s)]
*  New York had the rest. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=167.68s)]
*  So, you know, I think it was a, it was a, it was a, it was a, it was a, it was a [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  you know, that third quarter was awesome because Brunson and cat are awesome. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=172.08s)]
*  But like, I couldn't believe he put cat back in after he left with the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  lip. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=180.4s)]
*  After he twisted his ankle. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  They're down 18. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=181.76s)]
*  It's like, do you want to get stuck with some Tatum Isos? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=182.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=185.04s)]
*  With two minutes to go, let's do it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=185.28s)]
*  Well, he had, we're looking up and I'm looking at that thing. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=187.36s)]
*  I'm like, I don't feel like counts has come out. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=190.4s)]
*  My dad is like, no, no, he's come out. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=192.0s)]
*  And then he played 33 of the first 36 minutes of the game. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=193.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  So he just went all in on that third quarter with his starters, basically. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=196.88s)]
*  And they were great. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=200.56s)]
*  Try to hang around. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=201.6s)]
*  And it was, but the Celtics were playing their bench guys too. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  And, you know, trying to keep their guys fresh for the fourth quarter. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=205.68s)]
*  And then that fourth quarter started and you could see it at the game. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=208.16s)]
*  You could see like Hart, who was, I thought really good. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=211.44s)]
*  He's like, there any stoppage you could see his chest heaving and town started [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  this slowly die because towns was awesome. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=219.12s)]
*  They ran out of gas and the Celtics knew it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=221.44s)]
*  They started targeting them and then towns finally twisted his ankle. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=224.08s)]
*  But I just watched stuff like that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=226.88s)]
*  I know we've talked about this tip stuff forever about how he doesn't care about [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  the minutes, but I think it's really reckless. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=233.44s)]
*  This team just needs to get to the playoffs with these five guys being able [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=236.16s)]
*  to play 40 minutes a game. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  When we get to the playoffs, they don't need to do it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=240.48s)]
*  Now you look at the standings, it just doesn't matter after the top four and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=242.95999999999998s)]
*  whether they're going to be two, three or four. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=247.2s)]
*  I don't really feel like it matters. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=249.51999999999998s)]
*  I think it matters for them to be healthy, you know, and any Knicks fan I [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=251.44s)]
*  know is like, we'll just wait till we get Mitchell back. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=255.04s)]
*  It's like, all right, so that's going to be a big X factor in the playoffs. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=256.96s)]
*  This guy who barely ever plays, keeping your fingers crossed on him, keeping [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=260.0s)]
*  your fingers crossed on towns and six foot one Brunson and Dan and Obie, who [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=264.48s)]
*  always gets hurt to just be able to roll like this for 40 minutes a game. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=269.12s)]
*  I think it's irresponsible. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=274.08s)]
*  We've spent so many years though, talking about guys, not playing with effort, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=276.08s)]
*  effort, culture, all that stuff came up big time this past week with the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=280.08s)]
*  four nations tournament, how great that was. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=283.84s)]
*  I spent some time talking about just like, look, the sports are a little [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=285.68s)]
*  bit different, but I think the NBA is a much better place than when you go back [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=288.24s)]
*  five years ago. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=292.64s)]
*  I mean, it depends on which snapshot you want to take of like, man, these guys [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=293.76s)]
*  miss a lot of games. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=297.44s)]
*  And again, a lot of that stuff was team metadata. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=298.56s)]
*  So I don't know that any of it, like, I know them actually, the answer to it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=300.56s)]
*  None of us loved it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=304.0s)]
*  So I do feel guilty with what I think is Tibbs approach that, you know, when [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=305.2s)]
*  you're on his team, like, this is what we do. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  Like, this is what we do. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=311.12s)]
*  This is how hard we play. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=312.16s)]
*  And this is the approach. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=313.92s)]
*  And it seems like the players don't mind. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=315.92s)]
*  It's just funny when they do those player surveys, it's like, which coach [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  would you least want to play for? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=320.88s)]
*  Tibbs is almost always the answer because they see this stuff. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, and then Townes is somebody that I just think, and I thought he was really [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=326.24s)]
*  good in the first, in the second and third quarter. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=330.24s)]
*  I thought he was really good. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  But he's also somebody I think you have to be a little careful with. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=334.48s)]
*  He hasn't exactly been Cal Ripken Jr. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=337.12s)]
*  over the years, you know? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=339.6s)]
*  But when they got back in the game, Brunson got cooking, which he does from time to time. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=340.8s)]
*  The Celtics got, they did the same kind of the offense slow down. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=346.48s)]
*  But Townes, who had Tatum and a bunch of forwards guarding him, which Celtic strategy. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=350.32s)]
*  And then Townes was like, I'm going to actually use my weight and I'm going to bulldoze into dudes. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=355.6s)]
*  And, you know, the refs were letting him do it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=360.72s)]
*  And all of a sudden he went from like zero points to 20 in about, I don't know, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=363.44s)]
*  it felt like 20 minutes of real time, not even game time. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=368.4s)]
*  So when you watch the Knicks, when you see them, when they're all playing well, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=371.67999999999995s)]
*  and you see the five guys and they'll have these eight minute stretches where it makes sense. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=374.32s)]
*  I just don't think with the way he plays the minutes in the bench, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=378.88s)]
*  I don't really take them seriously as a championship contender, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=383.44s)]
*  which is one of the things I want to talk to you about today. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=386.56s)]
*  I think they're one level below. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=388.64s)]
*  I really only think it's OKC in Denver and the Celtics and Cleveland right now. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=390.79999999999995s)]
*  And I have room for a bunch of other people that these next 30 games can climb in. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=397.04s)]
*  But I think the Knicks are a level below those four teams right now. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=401.92s)]
*  You're right. And it's not just today. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=404.72s)]
*  And I thought Boston came out with like a great, like just an awesome approach, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=407.20000000000005s)]
*  just pushing the ball in transition. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=412.16s)]
*  That's when they're starting five with those five guys playing and you're going, OK, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=414.72s)]
*  this almost looks unfair. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=418.56s)]
*  Like there's just a jailer round was awful. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  I know he has points. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=422.08000000000004s)]
*  So bad. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=423.04s)]
*  You just couldn't understand what his approach to the game was today, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=424.23999999999995s)]
*  even though if you just box score, you'd be like, what are you guys talking about? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=427.11999999999995s)]
*  It got better. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=429.28s)]
*  It was a really bad first half. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=430.15999999999997s)]
*  It got a little better as the game went along, but it was not a great game for him. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=431.59999999999997s)]
*  So you're down 27. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=435.28s)]
*  I mean, we could talk minutes because you're right about the minutes part of it. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=437.28s)]
*  But to get it from 27 to four is exhausting. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=440.08s)]
*  On top of whatever Tibbs is doing in the sub pattern. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=444.88s)]
*  And then Boston, the only blemish on the entire two-year resume [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=447.84s)]
*  of this team is that you'll go, are you guys shooting the other team into this game right now? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=453.68s)]
*  Like, what the hell is going on? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=458.24s)]
*  And a lot of that happened in the third quarter. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=459.52s)]
*  But like back to your original point, did you have an open mind before today [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=460.96s)]
*  about the Knicks being in that one line of, right. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=465.84000000000003s)]
*  OK, because let's run through the resume. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=468.88s)]
*  It's 0 and 7 now against the three teams in Boston, Cleveland and OKC. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=470.64s)]
*  And it's also not close in those seven games. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=476.24s)]
*  They're losing by an average of 20 points in their down big. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=479.44s)]
*  Yeah, they're down big in every game at some point in the game. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=482.88s)]
*  These are blowout games and they've allowed 125 points per game [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=485.36s)]
*  against those three teams in those seven games. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=489.28000000000003s)]
*  So the data tell like I really enjoy them. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=491.12s)]
*  I think they're fun. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=494.32s)]
*  I can't wait to see what happens with them in the playoffs. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=495.28000000000003s)]
*  But as great as Kat has been, you can see against big wings and what Tatum's looking for. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=497.92s)]
*  Like Tatum had a couple like end of the first half, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=504.0s)]
*  he had two switches into Kat where he drives right on. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=506.96000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=509.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=510.24s)]
*  And I think one work one didn't. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=510.48s)]
*  They weren't like one was a really tough make. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=512.8000000000001s)]
*  The other was a decent look. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=514.64s)]
*  And then that play at the very end when he hits the three, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=516.08s)]
*  he knew like Kat was like, I don't want to run up [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=518.72s)]
*  because this guy's like attacking the shit out of me. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=521.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=524.08s)]
*  Tatum comes off the screen knowing he's pulling up because Kat is so far away from him. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=524.32s)]
*  And that's just what they're going to do. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=529.76s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=531.12s)]
*  Like maybe Mitchell Robinson helps. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=531.52s)]
*  Of course, he'll help if he's healthy. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=534.32s)]
*  But solving this seems like a massive ask of that guy. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=536.0s)]
*  I think the Celtics are a very bad matchup for them. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=541.12s)]
*  Like all the guys they have to throw up Brunson with all the ways they can attack towns with [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=543.9200000000001s)]
*  the fact that their two wings are just better than the next two wings. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=548.0s)]
*  And those guys are really good. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=550.8000000000001s)]
*  And, you know, I thought Josh Hart was fantastic today. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=552.5600000000001s)]
*  And especially just watching, you know, there's stuff you can see on TV, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=556.32s)]
*  but then in person, just the motor that he has. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=559.28s)]
*  And now he's just trying to catch his breath. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=562.08s)]
*  Every time the game stops, you can watch him. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=564.0s)]
*  He's just like taking these big breaths because he knows he's got to like go like a rabbit again. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=565.9200000000001s)]
*  But I think it's a bad matchup for them. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=570.9599999999999s)]
*  And Cleveland weirdly is, I think, even though Cleveland has been great and they have 10 losses [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=572.88s)]
*  and they're playing after we tape this, I think Cleveland's a more realistic series for them [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=577.76s)]
*  than the Celtics are with the size the Celts have. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=583.04s)]
*  Now the question with the Celtics is poor Zingas we saw today, who's moving great. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=587.36s)]
*  Are we getting that guy in April and May? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=591.52s)]
*  Drew, they've been really kid gloves with the whole season. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=593.76s)]
*  Chad Finn of the Boston Globe was writing that he's on the DJ plan. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=598.56s)]
*  I thought that was great. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=601.68s)]
*  I'm going to steal it from him. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=602.9599999999999s)]
*  He's just on that. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=604.64s)]
*  Yo, man, just be there in April, May, June. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=605.4399999999999s)]
*  We don't care about right now. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=608.3199999999999s)]
*  Feel free to just, just whatever, pick your spots. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=609.4399999999999s)]
*  Today he gave a shit. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=612.64s)]
*  When he gives a shit and poor Zingas is healthy, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=614.0799999999999s)]
*  this team is still, in my opinion, the best team in the league. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=616.4799999999999s)]
*  I just don't know. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=619.1999999999999s)]
*  Is that team going to be there in April and May? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=619.92s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=621.68s)]
*  They were so lucky with the injuries last year and then facing a Dallas team [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=622.96s)]
*  that wasn't going to be able to exploit some of the weaknesses to the point [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=626.88s)]
*  where they didn't even really need poor Zingas. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=629.2s)]
*  So the whole design of this Celtics team, the whole reason why you move [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=631.36s)]
*  the assets you do at the time and then remember the contractual obligation to poor Zingas. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=636.0s)]
*  Because even if you liked him in that Washington season where he was pretty good, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=641.5200000000001s)]
*  you're like, man, that's a leap of faith, but they had to do it to get him to opt out. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=644.5600000000001s)]
*  So look, when they're right, that first quarter, you're right. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=649.92s)]
*  I don't know what it looked like in person, so I'll defer to you here, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=655.5999999999999s)]
*  but that first quarter was just a nice little reminder. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=657.76s)]
*  They've been on a really good run here, by the way, too, after that weird 500 play stretch, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=660.0799999999999s)]
*  which basically is going to happen to anybody in today's NBA. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=664.24s)]
*  But that first quarter, I was like, man, is this nasty and they just do a great job. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=666.4799999999999s)]
*  And here's the most important stat. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=671.1999999999999s)]
*  Like I'll ask it. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=672.4799999999999s)]
*  What do you think the most important stat from today's box score was in this game? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=674.0s)]
*  What was it? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=678.64s)]
*  Rebounds? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=679.12s)]
*  Brunson zero free throw attempts. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=679.92s)]
*  Oh, because I had a Brunson thing for you. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=683.4399999999999s)]
*  Something important happened today. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=686.7199999999999s)]
*  There was a moment my dad and I agreed. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=688.0799999999999s)]
*  I think he's become the preeminent floper in the NBA. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=690.88s)]
*  I actually have to put him. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=695.4399999999999s)]
*  The reviewed player, the inbounds when he was coming right to left. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=697.52s)]
*  It's just a whole bunch of them. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=701.04s)]
*  He's doing it on both ends. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=702.8s)]
*  He's doing it on defense and offense. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=704.0s)]
*  By the way, kudos to him because it's working. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=706.7199999999999s)]
*  But I think Harden's getting a little older, right? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=709.12s)]
*  Maybe his best flopping days. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=712.08s)]
*  Probably 2018, 19 range. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=714.96s)]
*  Trey young was there for a second, but I think some of the rule changes have gotten his head. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=717.44s)]
*  Brunson's top of his game. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=721.28s)]
*  He's flopping on picks. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=722.88s)]
*  He's flopping, coming off screens. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=724.72s)]
*  He's flopping when somebody bumps into him on a drive. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=726.88s)]
*  He's flopping for charges. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=729.92s)]
*  I think he's the complete package. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=731.52s)]
*  It was some of the best flopping I've seen. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=733.2s)]
*  He's all first team. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=736.24s)]
*  No question. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=737.36s)]
*  Yeah, maybe I'm premature. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=739.2s)]
*  He's clearly in the running for MVP. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=740.8s)]
*  Maybe I'm vaulting him up too high. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=742.48s)]
*  What I saw today, I was in awe. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=744.48s)]
*  He didn't even get any free throws though. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=747.36s)]
*  I mean, this is a low free throw attempt game. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=749.28s)]
*  I think at the end of the third quarter, there was 16 total. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=751.28s)]
*  I think Cornett then took a couple. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=755.2s)]
*  They were letting them play. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=758.08s)]
*  Especially on the Towns drives, they were letting them play. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=759.28s)]
*  Yeah, but see, Towns, it's amazing how productive. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=762.24s)]
*  I don't know if there's anything in the NBA that I dislike more from start to finish [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=767.12s)]
*  that's more productive than his drives. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=770.5600000000001s)]
*  I think they're better this year than they even were with Minnesota. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=773.76s)]
*  It's flinging them up. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=776.64s)]
*  The Minnesota drives are like, what are you doing? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=777.68s)]
*  He's been so good. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=780.48s)]
*  This is the perfect role for him because there's all these other guys. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=782.08s)]
*  You could have a Mikhail game. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=784.8s)]
*  You can have an OG game. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=786.08s)]
*  Hart can go off. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=787.84s)]
*  Brunson is still going to be the focal point, all this stuff. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=788.72s)]
*  He's a stretch five, which I think is almost mandatory [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=791.36s)]
*  if you're trying to be a title contender. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=793.76s)]
*  We know their defensive numbers are not good. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=795.6800000000001s)]
*  We know what they are against those other top teams. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=797.6800000000001s)]
*  Today wasn't really close, man. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=800.72s)]
*  It wasn't. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=802.8000000000001s)]
*  It's weird with Bridges and OG. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=805.12s)]
*  I texted you during the game because one of my favorite Rizzolo jokes is, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=807.12s)]
*  was Tobias Harris out there? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=812.48s)]
*  Oh, no, he was out there for the last hour. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=813.6800000000001s)]
*  I always think of you anytime I'm watching a game and I'm like, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=815.7600000000001s)]
*  oh, it's Mikhail Bridges. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=818.5600000000001s)]
*  I forgot he was playing. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=820.1600000000001s)]
*  It's exciting. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=822.0s)]
*  And then OG, but both of those guys had these [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=822.64s)]
*  really like quarter long stretches where they might inbounds the ball. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=825.68s)]
*  I'm like, oh yeah, Bridges. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=829.04s)]
*  There he is. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=830.24s)]
*  They haven't figured out the same way the Celtics, I think, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=831.84s)]
*  with White and Holiday who can take a back seat because you have Tate. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=835.04s)]
*  No one has the ball a lot. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=839.6s)]
*  They'll run the place for Porzingis. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=840.72s)]
*  Jalen Brown will have his first five minutes of the second quarter [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=842.72s)]
*  as my dad's just bitching in the stands the entire time about the shots. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=845.68s)]
*  And White and Holiday have figured out how to kind of sneak in and out [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=849.28s)]
*  and get little fast break layups or get like threes in the corner. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=853.12s)]
*  And they're always involved. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=856.16s)]
*  And what I saw today and what I've seen on TV too is [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=857.76s)]
*  there's just games where Bridges and OG just aren't involved. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=860.48s)]
*  Did it feel like it was anything that was happening to them or [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=865.76s)]
*  because like Brunson got off to a really slow start [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=869.36s)]
*  and then those guys go nuts. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=872.56s)]
*  I mean, what was it? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=874.0799999999999s)]
*  38 points in the third quarter. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=874.64s)]
*  They were throwing everything. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=875.8399999999999s)]
*  They were throwing everything at Brunson. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=876.9599999999999s)]
*  They were really disciplined. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=878.32s)]
*  Brunson got Cornette a couple of times. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=881.2s)]
*  And then I thought there was another time where it was like the same movement [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=883.12s)]
*  where they're going to get Brunson down the left side. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=887.2s)]
*  And they brought Tatum over as like a third defender. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=888.72s)]
*  They just were like, fine. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=891.36s)]
*  So I thought there was these little moments in there [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=892.5600000000001s)]
*  that kind of back up what you're saying. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=894.8000000000001s)]
*  So go ahead. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=896.08s)]
*  Well, you know, I was ready to almost lead the pod with Tatum. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=897.44s)]
*  And then he had this really terrible stretch where I was like, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=902.4000000000001s)]
*  this is still like the last hump for him. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=905.5200000000001s)]
*  Because the first half of that game, his two way game, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=907.52s)]
*  and you saw it in the Philly game too. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=911.6s)]
*  And there's been a, and I feel like it's getting better as a year ago. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=913.1999999999999s)]
*  His passing, it feels like he's going to be between seven and 10 assists. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=915.76s)]
*  Almost every game now when he's locked in his rebounding [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=921.12s)]
*  and his Swiss army knife stuff that he does on D where he can guard [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=924.88s)]
*  basically everyone on the other team. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=928.48s)]
*  I do feel like he's going up a level, but there's that still that last piece where it's like, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=930.4s)]
*  he never has like the awesome 48 minute, oh my God, he blew my doors off game. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=936.0s)]
*  It's like three quarters of the four. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=941.36s)]
*  And I think that's the last level for him. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=943.5999999999999s)]
*  If you want to be on that SGA Jokic level, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=945.1999999999999s)]
*  you've got to do it for the whole two and a half hours. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=948.4s)]
*  And right now he's at about an hour 45. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=950.4s)]
*  Does that sound too nitpicky? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=952.7199999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=956.4s)]
*  My thing with Tatum is been pretty consistent that as much as I loved him, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=958.48s)]
*  and I think I appreciate him that there was never going to be a time where like that guy's [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=964.16s)]
*  the best player in the world. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=968.64s)]
*  Like that seems like an impossible goal to accomplish. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=971.36s)]
*  Would you agree with that? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=976.3199999999999s)]
*  Are you hesitating? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=981.12s)]
*  No, because sometimes when I watch him, when he's really going well, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=983.36s)]
*  I feel like he's got all the pieces, but I don't at this point, I think it would have happened. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=988.8s)]
*  I think we would have had some sort of nudge where we would have had some crazy stretch, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=992.72s)]
*  that all the greatest players have had. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=997.9200000000001s)]
*  Like what SGA just had, where SGA was just like, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=999.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm just going to score 50 points a bunch of times though. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1002.72s)]
*  And my team's just going to win every game. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1005.2s)]
*  And it's just, that's the last. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1007.9200000000001s)]
*  So he's like a level below and that, you know, the, all the MVP ballot stuff, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1009.28s)]
*  the MVPs basically done as the top two guys. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1013.28s)]
*  But I think Tatum's, I think he's been the third best guy in the league this year. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1015.6s)]
*  I would put him against Giannis. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1019.36s)]
*  I would pick Tatum. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1020.5600000000001s)]
*  I think he's had a bigger impact on a winning team. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1021.84s)]
*  I know his team's been a little bit better, but he's, the durability thing is the piece [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1023.84s)]
*  with him that I just think he doesn't get credit for. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1027.8400000000001s)]
*  He fucking plays. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1029.92s)]
*  Yeah. He's, look, this is the most I've ever appreciated him. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1032.16s)]
*  Me too. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1035.6000000000001s)]
*  His passing, the way he beats guys, like a team the other day, we were just kind of like [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1036.88s)]
*  bullshit because Goldsberry and I had done constructing our most complimentary starting [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1042.96s)]
*  five of today's players, right? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1046.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1048.4s)]
*  And I just, I put Tatum on it because I felt like he provides so much. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1048.72s)]
*  I mean, he's basically playing point guard at this size. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1053.5200000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1056.48s)]
*  And I don't know that that gets talked about a lot nationally. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1056.8000000000002s)]
*  And guarding towns on the other end, like that there's nobody in the league doing [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1059.44s)]
*  that other than him basically. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1063.0400000000002s)]
*  Right. Which is what he did in the NBA finals. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1064.5600000000002s)]
*  Now granted the game's different. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1066.88s)]
*  So it's not like he's down in the post against Moses Malone for 40 post-ups a game, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1068.24s)]
*  but he was, he was a center on defense and he's playing point guard. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1074.0s)]
*  And, you know, maybe somebody else brings the ball up, but then they bring it back to him [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1078.24s)]
*  and it's this decision-making. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1081.36s)]
*  And so, you know, maybe there's some output stuff that doesn't line up with the SGA or [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1082.64s)]
*  the nights where ant goes fucking crazy, you know, which is just so much fun to watch. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1087.68s)]
*  Like ant having one of those nights is probably still my favorite thing other than just a [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1091.28s)]
*  reminiscent Curry flamethrower game. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1096.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1099.52s)]
*  Honestly, I'm probably, I would tell you like the certain moments with ant that I probably [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1100.08s)]
*  still like more than any other single player in the league, but now Tatum just has more options [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1103.92s)]
*  around him. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1108.0s)]
*  I still would say Boston at its peak has more options offensively than even Oklahoma city [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1108.96s)]
*  does. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1113.68s)]
*  I don't know if there would be much of an argument there. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1114.16s)]
*  So even though you're not getting that peak output that would maybe put him in the belt [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1116.0s)]
*  conversation, I am so happy with his approach that it's I'll take this. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1119.68s)]
*  He's a cyst ratio on the advanced stuff has never been better. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1125.44s)]
*  You know, a lot of the advanced metrics are like peak for him, but there's also, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1128.64s)]
*  it's not just a counting thing. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1132.16s)]
*  It's not even the metrics. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1133.36s)]
*  There's just an eye test thing with him where how steady he is. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1134.16s)]
*  Like he had a baseline drive on OG where he went right into him and moved him off the [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1137.12s)]
*  spot and got the free throws. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1143.4399999999998s)]
*  And I'm like, how many other guys 20 plus feet away would have the balls to drive at [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1144.8s)]
*  OG and look like the stronger player? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1149.4399999999998s)]
*  So I've never like, I've never been more in love with his game than what I've seen this [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1152.0s)]
*  season. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1157.36s)]
*  That's how I felt today watching it. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1158.1599999999999s)]
*  I just feel like he's maximized a lot of stuff that he's been working on the last couple [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1159.9199999999998s)]
*  of years. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1163.84s)]
*  And if you took this version of Tatum and you put this version in the 22 finals, I think [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1164.1599999999999s)]
*  they beat the Warriors and he wasn't even close to being able to do 40% of the stuff [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1169.28s)]
*  that he could do now. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1173.84s)]
*  I love the rebounding. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1174.9599999999998s)]
*  I don't think he gets enough credit for that. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1176.0s)]
*  And I love the durability and the fact, you know, JJ said something about this because [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1177.52s)]
*  he was talking about the Lakers. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1181.52s)]
*  This is even before the Dallas game when he was, you know, cause they're way better on [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1182.56s)]
*  defense, the Lakers. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1186.56s)]
*  I think they're like third in defensive rate in the last 20 games. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1187.4399999999998s)]
*  And you know, they were even playing better before the trade. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1190.48s)]
*  And somebody asked him what was different. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1193.84s)]
*  And he's like, you know, the NBA is about just playing hard, just playing, like making [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1196.08s)]
*  sure your team plays hard every night. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1202.1599999999999s)]
*  And I think that's a skill that Tatum, where if he's taken off a quarter and Charlotte, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1204.32s)]
*  you really notice it because of the, the level of intensity that he has game to game, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1209.9199999999998s)]
*  quarter to quarter, half to half. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1214.8s)]
*  When he doesn't have you're like, oh shit, what's wrong with Tatum? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1216.24s)]
*  What, what's he doing? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1219.9199999999998s)]
*  He's just jacking up shots. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1221.04s)]
*  Why isn't he rebounding? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1222.24s)]
*  Like it's really like glaring. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1223.12s)]
*  So anyway, I think you should get probably more credit for, for that. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1224.4799999999998s)]
*  I don't know if there's an extra half step for him. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1228.3999999999999s)]
*  Maybe we'll find out in the playoffs. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1231.04s)]
*  You really think it's, well, I think you've already answered that it's kind of a closed [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1233.28s)]
*  case, but I mean, at any point, do you think, I mean, I guess he's got a couple of years [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1236.0s)]
*  to go, but is he going to surpass SGA? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1241.6s)]
*  I don't think it's ever going to be as easy like that for the Yoke Edge stuff, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1245.9199999999998s)]
*  that Yoke Edge night to night. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1251.52s)]
*  It's just easy for him to create shots for everybody, the best possible shots, right? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1252.96s)]
*  Last night's a bad example, but for the most part SGA is just like, he's just getting the 35. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1257.1200000000001s)]
*  He's just getting the 40. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1263.52s)]
*  It doesn't matter what you're doing. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1264.72s)]
*  He's just going to get to where his points are. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1265.92s)]
*  And I think Luca is in that category too. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1267.68s)]
*  I don't know if Tatum's ever going to be at that level, but I think to me, he reminds me. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1270.08s)]
*  It's a weird one. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1274.4s)]
*  And I, and I know I'm thinking about it probably because we just finished this nine [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1275.1200000000001s)]
*  part Celtics docuseries, but to me, he's more like a Havlicek type. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1278.32s)]
*  He's the Swiss army knife that does all these different things for your team. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1282.72s)]
*  He's never the best score in the league. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1287.4399999999998s)]
*  He's never the best assist guy, but he just, he's just additive. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1289.12s)]
*  And I think that's the level that he's gotten to. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1292.96s)]
*  So he probably reminds me of Havlicek the most, even though he's taller and, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1294.8s)]
*  you know, he's got size, all that stuff, but just like they could play small ball center [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1298.96s)]
*  with them if they wanted. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1302.8799999999999s)]
*  He could also play point guard for them if he wanted. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1304.08s)]
*  The other thing with the South side, I think Cornet has been playing really well [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1307.04s)]
*  and Pritchard's been up and down. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1311.1200000000001s)]
*  How's there's coming back, but they're getting more of a bench than I think. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1312.8s)]
*  And then Horford being able to only play like 18, 20 minutes. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1315.76s)]
*  Their bench is, is back. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1319.1200000000001s)]
*  And I think I wouldn't be surprised if they went on a little run here over the next, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1321.04s)]
*  next three, four weeks, because they haven't really had a run this season. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1326.16s)]
*  You know, we're going to talk about that after the break, some teams that we think might make [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1329.6s)]
*  an actual run. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1332.8s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if they had a streak. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1334.0s)]
*  Like have you been, have you felt like they've had one kick ass three week stretch other than [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1337.28s)]
*  like you'd have to go back to November? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1342.32s)]
*  I just don't remember it. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1343.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1345.84s)]
*  But I mean, aren't they, are they 12 and three, 11 and four in the last 15? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1346.08s)]
*  I mean, I know it was. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1350.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1351.04s)]
*  But I'm talking about like what the stuff they were doing last year where they were [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1351.36s)]
*  just like ripping people's heads off for three straight weeks. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1354.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1357.52s)]
*  They're 10 and two in their last 12. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1357.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1359.92s)]
*  This, this kind of feels like it other than, you know, the start. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1360.4s)]
*  Maybe we're in the middle of it. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1364.0s)]
*  92. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1364.6399999999999s)]
*  They also had that, I don't know, what is it? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1365.1999999999998s)]
*  Seven game stretch there in November. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1367.84s)]
*  So the weird thing was just a couple of games against lesser opponents, the Toronto game, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1369.84s)]
*  they could have lost a New Orleans game and the standard for them is so much higher. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1374.8799999999999s)]
*  But that first quarter was so impressive that, you know, I was just a nice little reminder, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1379.28s)]
*  I think on a national stage for everybody of like, this is what this team is capable of. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1384.8799999999999s)]
*  And I don't know that there's anybody else. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1388.8799999999999s)]
*  I've granted you talk about the OKC defense, which I'm sure we'll get to a little bit later today. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1390.8799999999999s)]
*  Might be the tiebreaker for a lot of different people, but those first 12 minutes were just awesome. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1394.8s)]
*  I want to talk about intriguing subplots with 30 games left. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1398.96s)]
*  And some of them are easy to figure out and some of them are a little harder to figure out, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1403.36s)]
*  but the number one subplot to me, and I can't believe I'm even saying this, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1406.8s)]
*  and it makes me mad that we're in this position, but what can you do? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1410.3999999999999s)]
*  I think the Lakers are the number one subplot to watch over the next 30 games. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1414.32s)]
*  The Denver game was so interesting last night to see like the real Luca in a Lakers game [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1418.4s)]
*  and to watch, you know, their centers, whatever, they're just double teaming Jokic. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1424.48s)]
*  They're just going to be happy with Westbrook and those, like whoever, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1429.1200000000001s)]
*  fine, shoot 16 for 41 from three. We don't care. We got to take out Jokic. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1432.5600000000002s)]
*  But the thing that I really noticed that people talked about when they made the trade was just [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1436.48s)]
*  48 minutes of Luca and LeBron or Luca or LeBron, but you always have somebody out there who just [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1441.2s)]
*  has this crazy IQ and is a really good offensive player. And I've never wavered from thinking [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1449.76s)]
*  Luca was going to be awesome on this team. I just thought it was scary last night. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1457.04s)]
*  And if I'm in the West, I think there's four teams that can win the title and we can talk [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1462.64s)]
*  about a couple of wild cards. I think the Lakers are an official wild card for me. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1466.72s)]
*  I agree. And it's the defensive numbers. Like you mentioned it, if you go back to the last 15, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1471.3600000000001s)]
*  that's the number one defense in the league. They're 12 and three is the best record over [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1475.28s)]
*  the last 15. The offense is top 10. Do you understand that? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1478.64s)]
*  What's your explanation for that other than just they're playing hard? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1481.52s)]
*  Well, I think having some of the pieces, I thought Rui played his ass off last night, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1485.76s)]
*  both. I mean, you can look at the points, but it was what he was doing defensively. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1492.0800000000002s)]
*  Now, granted Vando comes in and just hacks the shit out of Jokic, but you know, it's like, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1495.6000000000001s)]
*  they're not going to call all of these, although they tried to call all of them on Binderbund [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1499.28s)]
*  because he didn't play a ton of minutes. But you know, the camera-ish thing seems over. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1502.56s)]
*  The Dalton Connect minutes are limited if you start looking at these things. So I think we [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1507.76s)]
*  gave Vincent being healthy with Vando being healthy with them liking this Rui center matchup stuff, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1511.52s)]
*  because they're basically forced to figure this out because the Jackson Hayes minutes usually [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1516.96s)]
*  aren't that great because the longer he's out there, the longer there's just going to be [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1520.6399999999999s)]
*  something that happens. And specific to last night, Bill, I loved that game. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1524.08s)]
*  Okay. Me too. I thought it was really impressive. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1529.4399999999998s)]
*  Because we look at the playoff and you go bracket-wise, like how far can LA go? It's like, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1532.1599999999999s)]
*  well, they're going to run it to Denver again, so that's not going to work. And last night's one [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1535.9199999999998s)]
*  result. But I thought this coaching staff showed the difference where it's always about the roster [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1539.36s)]
*  for me. But there are little times like Kenny Atkinson this year with Cleveland, like clearly [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1544.1599999999999s)]
*  there's something better with this, with his approach to basketball. I think JJ and this staff [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1547.76s)]
*  did such a fantastic job of last night's preparation. The possessions, when you really [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1552.24s)]
*  looked at what they were doing, there's these non-spacing lineups that Denver runs out there [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1557.84s)]
*  outside of Jokic, where the Lakers are like, if this is what you're going to run out, we are not [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1561.92s)]
*  going to pay attention to Aaron Gordon. We're not going to care about Westbrook. They had a play, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1566.96s)]
*  and I'll finish here, but LeBron was on Jokic kind of in the paint, left side. Dalton is in the [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1570.8s)]
*  dunker spot, ignoring Aaron Gordon. He's basically under the rim. The other two wing players to the [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1577.12s)]
*  right, the Lakers defenders are in the paint. So that's four players in the paint against Jokic. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1583.36s)]
*  The only one that was providing any spacing was Michael Porter Jr. at the top of the key, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1588.32s)]
*  and Rui was defending him, but Rui was only a foot beyond the free throw line. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1592.56s)]
*  And you saw possession after possession where you could see the Lakers specifically the way they [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1596.8799999999999s)]
*  prepped that game last night. I think that's a credit to JJ and the staff going, we've got [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1603.04s)]
*  to come up with something new that's Jokic specific, and it worked. It really wasn't much [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1608.56s)]
*  of a game on top of all the Luka stuff that I know you want to get to. Well, they did the same thing [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1613.84s)]
*  to that Celtics game that we both went to in LA, where they kicked the Celtics ass, and part of it [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1618.1599999999999s)]
*  was they just were really well prepared, and they used a bunch of things against the Celtics that I [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1624.0s)]
*  had kind of been waiting for somebody to do. Especially like, oh, you're going to try to [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1629.52s)]
*  force it to Prozingis? Great. That's going to throw your whole team out of whack. Keep giving [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1636.48s)]
*  the ball, and Prozingis had a good first quarter and nobody else did. And then it's like, oh, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1640.72s)]
*  here's the top of the second quarter. This is when Jalen tries to get his offense for six minutes. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1644.8s)]
*  We're going to make it really hard for him. And you were just watching it going, oh, this team's [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1648.8s)]
*  got their shit together. Last night against Denver, you would think, well, why doesn't everybody do [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1653.76s)]
*  that against Jokic? First of all, it's hard to do it. Second of all, it's hard to commit to it, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1658.4s)]
*  and your guys have to be really disciplined with it, but they also have smart players. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1662.64s)]
*  Everyone makes fun of Luka's defense, but he's still a really smart basketball player. LeBron [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1666.64s)]
*  I think has been noticeably better on defense for what, a month and a half now? I don't know [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1672.3200000000002s)]
*  what the timeline is. We were the first month of the season where it was like, oh my God, he's [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1678.4s)]
*  not playing. He's a DH now. Now he's really active and they just have size and physicality that I [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1682.4s)]
*  think you saw it against the Celtics. They bullied the Celtics. Now, you know, slightly different [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1689.04s)]
*  team, but when they have those, when they have Rui and LeBron and Luka all together, like those, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1694.32s)]
*  that's like 800 pounds of dudes. So are you in, are you in, are they your fifth team? Are they the first [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1699.6s)]
*  team outside of your tier one playoff, like title contenders? Well, I wrote down, I wrote down. You [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1706.32s)]
*  teared us up? No, I wrote down things I like about them. And the number one thing is just always [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1712.1599999999999s)]
*  having Luka or LeBron out there, one of the two or both. I think it's just, it's just really hard [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1717.4399999999998s)]
*  to play them. You don't have a moment like you had with the Knicks today where Brunston has to sit [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1722.72s)]
*  down. It's like, all right, it's campaign time. Cross your fingers. Like the Lakers just never [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1726.96s)]
*  have that. The campaign was nice though, that first shift. He was, he was, he made three in a row. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1731.36s)]
*  That's probably the best thing ever for a Knicks opponent. Be like, Hey, don't forget like tight [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1735.6s)]
*  game, second half campaign made three in a row in the first half. So that's good for us. He's [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1739.6s)]
*  going to think he can get to 20. The fact that the defensive numbers are like, if they were ninth or [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1743.76s)]
*  11th, the Lakers, I'd be like, okay, that's a little fluky. There's probably some, when you're [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1750.7199999999998s)]
*  in the top five, when you're in the top three, like that's not fluky at some point. I think JJ [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1755.9199999999998s)]
*  is a legitimately good coach. And I thought what they did last night to Joker, who was terrible [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1761.04s)]
*  because they made him terrible. But then you just look at it. It's just that at some point it's math [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1768.24s)]
*  last night, LeBron and Luca had 59, 19 and 12. If you're going to get numbers that look like that [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1773.28s)]
*  from your best two guys, you're going to be heard from, from a couple of playoff rounds. So if I was [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1779.04s)]
*  a Laker fan, I'd be excited, but this is why we all went nuts with the trade happen. This is crazy. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1783.28s)]
*  You don't just get to add the fourth best guy in your team, in the league to your team, just, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1788.88s)]
*  you know, for Anthony Davis, Max Christie, who by the way has been playing great. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1794.0s)]
*  Yeah, he has been good. I think some of the worst anti-LeBron content that I've ever seen [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1798.0s)]
*  was Lucas stat lines, those first three games with LeBron. Like I get, if you hate LeBron, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1804.3200000000002s)]
*  you hate LeBron. Brett, come up with better evidence than that. Cause I went to the Lucas first game, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1810.3200000000002s)]
*  you know, that he had played in like two months. I went to crypto that night to watch him play as [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1815.76s)]
*  Utah and he was so tired, like four times up and down the court. I'm like, Oh man, I'm like, he's so [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1820.48s)]
*  tired. Like he doesn't even, cause you know, he hasn't been complaining cause he's on a new team. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1829.68s)]
*  Like you haven't seen him and it was kind of funny. Like obviously last night's the best that he's [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1835.92s)]
*  looked with the Lakers. That first half was incredible. The way he was kind of getting into [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1840.64s)]
*  a shot, not like basketball's funny, man. You can be this incredible player. Here we are talking [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1845.2s)]
*  about somebody who has a chance to be the best player in the world. And it's like, I'm, I'm new [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1850.32s)]
*  here. So I'm just trying to fit in for a little bit. And if you're a coach and it's Luca, you're [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1853.84s)]
*  like, don't be trying to fit in to just do what you do. And then we'll figure it out around you. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1858.72s)]
*  And just because the stats were bad and then they had the weird breaks, like all that stuff was so [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1865.2s)]
*  stupid. He was great last night. It was funny too, cause he, he made a play and then he cycled out [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1869.28s)]
*  the three point line and was wide open and he didn't get the ball back. And it's the first [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1873.68s)]
*  time I've seen him pissed with the Lakers and he put his hands up like you idiots, like what are you, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1877.8400000000001s)]
*  what are you doing? And I'm going, this is great. This is, this is like this, that's what you want [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1883.52s)]
*  out of this dude. You want to rest that he didn't get the ball back. So I'm, I'm shocked. The [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1889.28s)]
*  defensive numbers are that good. The last 15, it's been a big part of this turnaround. They finally [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1894.16s)]
*  beat Denver. So I'm not ready to say that they've solved Denver. You know, there's just going to be [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1899.68s)]
*  some spacing stuff in the playoffs where if it's Westbrook or if it's Brown and I think even Michael [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1903.6000000000001s)]
*  Porter jr. is like a coin toss game. Gordon is a matchup specific guy, but they're going to ignore [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1908.8s)]
*  him even though he's shooting like over 40% from three. They just did a great job of loading up on [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1915.2s)]
*  all this stuff. But look, man, you're closing group in a tight playoff game. If the three perimeter [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1919.8400000000001s)]
*  dudes are LeBron, Luca and Reeves, I have a hard time believing that defense is going to be just [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1924.24s)]
*  living on stops though in the play. Right. Right. Yeah. They're probably trying to outscore. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1930.0s)]
*  Um, yeah, the Luca dialogue was, I feel like a lot of the sports dialogue is just getting worse [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1935.28s)]
*  because it's, it's, it's just as quick rush to whatever judgment, you know, he could have one bad [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1942.3200000000002s)]
*  game as first like your game. And it was like, Oh my God, this is why the maps traded them. And it's, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1947.6000000000001s)]
*  nobody thinks of the human element of this guy thought he was going to be the next third, the [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1952.1599999999999s)]
*  whiskey in Dallas. He had no idea the trade was coming. They trade him. He's got to move to LA. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1956.3999999999999s)]
*  He's got to figure out where he's going to live. He's taking shit about that. He's got a drinking [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1962.32s)]
*  problem and that he eats too much and they didn't want to give the max and they're just, you know, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1966.9599999999998s)]
*  laying into him left and right, leaking stuff to make them look bad. On top of that, he's got to [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1971.6799999999998s)]
*  figure out how he fits into this new team. He's got to play with LeBron, who's this guy he grew up [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1976.1599999999999s)]
*  watching, right? He's got to figure out how it fits in offense, new coaching staff. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1981.0400000000002s)]
*  He's not in shape. It's like, Oh, you think this is going to go bad for like a week? [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1985.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And he hadn't played. He hadn't played basketball like Perkins, three day Perkins [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1990.0s)]
*  tweeted three days ago. It's going to be another two, three weeks before we see the real Luca. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1995.44s)]
*  He has to get in basketball shape, get his legs under. And then last night he tweets, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=1999.52s)]
*  Like I said, give Luca time. It's like, yeah, no kidding. We got to give Luca time. Sure. To [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2003.36s)]
*  adjust to his new team and get back in shape. I'm pretty sure he'll be able to figure this out. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2012.08s)]
*  He's had one of the five best offensive starts to anybody in the history of the NBA in their first [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2016.8s)]
*  seven years. I think we're going to be okay with Luca Doncic. I'm not worried, but people were [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2021.12s)]
*  worried. It's, I don't know what happened. Like who did you respect that is what was worried? [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2025.92s)]
*  Well, that's, but some people have platforms who this is, this is kind of what you do. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2030.8s)]
*  You just go nuts, get mad. Luca Doncic was terrible. This is why the Mavericks traded him. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2036.08s)]
*  I would say over 50% of your tweets are about LeBron or Jordan. Then you should just be banned [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2044.32s)]
*  from the platform. It's fair. We can talk to Elon about it. Um, so you've been hanging out with him [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2048.72s)]
*  much of it. I haven't talked to him. Um, Lakers have the six best odds on Fandel right now. So [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2054.88s)]
*  it's not a hot take to say, Oh, I think they're a title contender. I think that's where they are. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2060.88s)]
*  I think they're in that wild card team. I went back and I looked at, uh, I think this, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2065.6800000000003s)]
*  this needs a name. I came up with post all-star late bloomer, but I think we could do better. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2070.96s)]
*  I don't know. That sounds great. Thanks. What is it? Well, these teams that over the course of the [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2077.44s)]
*  last 30 games at some point got their shit together and became a real contender. So the [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2083.04s)]
*  reason I thought of this was because we watched it happen with Dallas last year. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2088.0s)]
*  Dallas was 16 and four to finish the season. They were fifth net. They just remember they had a big [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2091.12s)]
*  winning streak. Then they had a losing streak and then they started winning again. And at some point [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2098.48s)]
*  it felt like there might be something there in a real way, right? 2023. It happened with the Lakers. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2103.44s)]
*  They were 16 and seven down the stretch fourth net. They ended up making the Western finals. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2109.2s)]
*  2022 is when the Celtics were they 25 and 25 then went on the run. Their last 22 games, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2114.24s)]
*  they were 17 and five first in that below 502, like it might've been maybe 24, 25. They made [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2120.48s)]
*  the finals. I threw out the two strike, uh, not strike the COVID years. And then in 2019, Portland [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2126.16s)]
*  finished the last 25, 19 and six fourth net and they made the Western finals. So this does, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2133.9199999999996s)]
*  there is a team, there's a track record of a team we didn't think was in the top three or top four [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2139.2799999999997s)]
*  moves up there. And for me, it's either the Lakers or Golden State. And we're taping this right now [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2145.6s)]
*  as a, as Golden State's playing and they're beating up on Dallas, but those would be my two picks. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2150.24s)]
*  Golden State or the Lakers. And I probably lean Lakers cause a, cause a Luca and the talent. Who [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2155.7599999999998s)]
*  would you have? It feels like the Knicks are on the Lakers line of this though, right? That's fair, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2159.8399999999997s)]
*  but I don't think they would you necessarily say they would be an out of nowhere team. I guess it [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2166.3999999999996s)]
*  could conceivably happen. I, I think they're more likely to have more injuries and weird shit [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2171.52s)]
*  happened than to go on and run, but maybe I'm wrong. Okay. But here's, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2176.56s)]
*  here's something that I like about the Lakers. Cause I think this is always an important thing. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2180.08s)]
*  And because I think guys play more often now, cause this could get really misleading. Sometimes [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2183.7599999999998s)]
*  you're looking at like a matchups against the better teams. You're like, okay, who was there? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2187.8399999999997s)]
*  You know, like even when I go through those Nick seven games is basically everybody playing [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2191.04s)]
*  in those games for the Knicks. I think OG missed one. So, you know, there's different times where [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2195.2s)]
*  you go head to head and you're, you're looking at it and getting ready for the playoffs, but like, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2200.16s)]
*  how do they do against each other? You're like, all these guys miss these games. But again, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2203.2s)]
*  like I said, it's been a little bit better. The Lakers are one of three teams in the west of the [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2206.56s)]
*  winning record against teams 500 or better. So clearly okay. See's 20 and nine, the Rockets are [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2210.16s)]
*  20 and 15 and the Lakers are 15 and 12. And I think that's important. Memphis is under 500, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2215.9199999999996s)]
*  Memphis is under 500, Denver's under 500, the Clippers are to 500, Minnesota's under 500. So [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2220.8s)]
*  again, like I said, only three teams, the rest of them are all under 500. I think for me on the [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2225.44s)]
*  Lakers part of it is we're totally aligned on the Luca thing. Like, give me a break. Like this guy [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2231.84s)]
*  at this age with his track record and because he hasn't played in two months, so you're like, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2236.7200000000003s)]
*  if you were watching these early games going, what's wrong? So this is what you think it's [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2242.48s)]
*  going to be now. You just think this is going to be like, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2246.1600000000003s)]
*  she's going to be a complete mess. Yeah. Do you know how absurd that is? So it's, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2248.72s)]
*  we're not even at peak Luca. They're putting together this performance. They have this defensive [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2252.96s)]
*  profile the last month or so, but you know, bracket it out. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2257.52s)]
*  Four or five, they're playing Houston. You're probably picking the Lakers because you trust [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2263.04s)]
*  their offense more than you trust Houston's offense. Right. Okay. Then, then guess what's [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2266.4s)]
*  waiting for them on the other line. Sadly, I, sadly I did this and as you know, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2271.04s)]
*  I hate the Lakers and this made me sad. Okay. But how serious by serious, I was like, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2275.12s)]
*  Oh my God, they're going to fucking make the Western finals. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2279.92s)]
*  So they're beating Oklahoma city in a one, four matchup. You're crazy. Oh no, I'm just saying [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2282.88s)]
*  there's a scenario with these brackets where if they're not four or five, if they can somehow [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2287.8399999999997s)]
*  avoid okay. See to the Western finals, right. And then you think they're going to beat Oklahoma city. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2292.16s)]
*  Well, so they would have to get to two or three. Okay. All right. I think it's completely, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2298.3199999999997s)]
*  completely reasonable right now. They're 34 and 21, Memphis is 37, 19 and Denver's 37 and 20. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2303.36s)]
*  I think they have to leapfrog. I don't think they'd want to play. Okay. See, but I also [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2309.36s)]
*  wouldn't blindly pick okay. See against the, against Luca LeBron either. Would you, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2312.72s)]
*  I mean, I know I would pick them to win, but I wouldn't be like, I wouldn't be like, oh, lock [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2318.96s)]
*  it in, write it in, in marker that okay. See is a hundred percent winning. I'd be a little nervous. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2323.92s)]
*  Well, I want to see more of the chat stuff, but defensively the chest stuff has been really good. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2330.0s)]
*  So, you know, it's, it's not the same as the lucid thing, but I mean, we're looking at [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2333.84s)]
*  Chet missing three months and then trying to come back. He's not taking a ton of shot. Like I can't [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2338.16s)]
*  wait to see what that guy looks like and what this team looks like. So there's just, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2342.16s)]
*  but they still have a massive issue with certain matchup bigs. And normally I would say, what are [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2346.96s)]
*  you going to do against Yokech? Like, do you really think you're going to survive seven games against [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2351.6s)]
*  like having Rui was great last night, but let's not lose our minds about who this team is. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2355.68s)]
*  I still have Denver and okay. See in the Western finals, but I think if you start thinking about [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2362.56s)]
*  series by series, game by game, this Lakers team is scary, especially with the fact that they're [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2368.56s)]
*  actually well-coached. Right. And there's, they're a matchup team. I think they're a team that could [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2373.12s)]
*  win on the road in a game seven, right? How many teams could actually go on the road and win a game [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2377.6s)]
*  seven? It's not the longest possible list. This is a team that would not be afraid to go on the road. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2382.24s)]
*  I think the Vincent thing is important for them too, because that's a guy who they signed who's [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2387.04s)]
*  been banged up or sucked for a year and a half. And then people forgot that he wasn't good. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2392.56s)]
*  People forgot that he was actually good and valuable in Miami and was in big games for them [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2397.52s)]
*  and kind of knows where to go and what to do. He's one of those guys. And you need a guy like that [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2402.08s)]
*  in a weird team like this. And the fact that Reeves has gone up a level and JJ loves Reeves. I mean, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2406.08s)]
*  the best thing JJ and LeBron have done have been just pump Reeves up, pump them up, make them really [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2411.6s)]
*  think he's this gifted offensive player. And I think he's playing with so much confidence now. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2417.44s)]
*  Like he's, how many teams have a third guy who's as good of an offensive player as Reeves is? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2422.72s)]
*  It's not a long list. It isn't a very long list. I mean, Pat Bev really went for it last night. I [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2428.88s)]
*  think he tweeted out, they have the best one through four in the NBA. And I was like, who's the fourth? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2434.56s)]
*  It was like Rui. I'm like, all right, going, I think you're forgetting about Boston and then [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2438.24s)]
*  OKC with chat. I think there's a lot of guys that you could pick from there that would be in the [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2443.6s)]
*  conversation. But as far as like number three guys with Reeves, I mean, is it Derek White? [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2448.24s)]
*  Is it? I was thinking somebody on Cleveland. Is it like Mobley? It's just a completely different [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2454.3999999999996s)]
*  kind of player. Like I'd rather have Mobley than Reeves, but offensively like initiating your own [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2460.08s)]
*  stuff. It's not even a conversation. Reeves is so good at it. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2464.32s)]
*  When you're talking about good offensive players, a good litmus test is that guy scored 45 last [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2467.44s)]
*  night. Are you surprised? Right. Like if Derek White scored 45, I'd be like, what? Did he make [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2474.1600000000003s)]
*  like 12 threes? What happened? But Reeves had that game the other day when everybody was hurt. What [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2480.96s)]
*  did he have? Like 38, 40? No, he had 45. He was 46. Right. I wasn't shocked. Yeah. But the other [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2484.88s)]
*  stars are Dorian Finney-Smith, who by the way, like we hadn't even mentioned yet for the defensive [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2494.16s)]
*  part of what they've done. Right. You know, getting D'Angelo Russell away from this basketball team. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2498.24s)]
*  You know, I try to tell you guys, Lakers fans, I know I get it. You know, he makes a couple threes [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2503.3599999999997s)]
*  and points and you guys are super into that. But getting him away from this group has also been a [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2507.6s)]
*  big transition from who they are right now. Like I feel bad we didn't even mention Dorian Finney-Smith [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2513.52s)]
*  at this point. I mean, he made one shot last night and he was a plus 20. That trade made me mad. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2518.48s)]
*  Why? Because you liked D'Angelo Russell so much? No, because I like the, I wanted the Lakers to not [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2526.72s)]
*  be good. I said, fuck, they got Finney-Smith. Finney-Smith's good. He's an additive player. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2531.84s)]
*  There were some guys around the trade deadline that I was wondering, like I still can't believe [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2537.76s)]
*  the Lakers didn't go after Nick Cliaxton. Was he available though? I don't know what. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2541.84s)]
*  But what are the Nets doing? I mean, playing their ass off. I know, but they traded to get [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2546.16s)]
*  their picks back for some tanking plan and then they just can't stop beating teams. I know. I just [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2554.24s)]
*  don't think Philly was ready for the Keon Johnson Watford two-man game to close. They had no [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2559.2799999999997s)]
*  scattering report on that. Watford was like, I got to get this video to the scouts. I tried to turn [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2563.8399999999997s)]
*  that game off like four different times last night. Yeah, you couldn't. I hate watching the Sixers play [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2569.7599999999998s)]
*  basketball. They are disgusting. Okay. I can't, but I can't turn it off. And then I was like, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2575.52s)]
*  that's close. And I'm like, look at Brooklyn, look at this team. No, they can't stop. It's now [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2583.28s)]
*  they're ahead of them. They're ahead of them in the standings and the ease that flipped it. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2589.52s)]
*  In that Philly game, they had a couple of moments where they blew the lead and like, all right, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2592.72s)]
*  value and effort. Exactly. Somebody else would hit a three and they'd be winning again. Whatever [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2596.48s)]
*  Philly is doing to Embiid is one of the weirdest subplots of not just the year, but the decade. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2602.56s)]
*  I have no idea why he's playing and he looks miserable. He's falling down. I think twice as [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2607.2s)]
*  much as he's ever fallen down. Uh, looks like he's literally hurt. What's his F pro 100? Do you know? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2612.4s)]
*  I think this is the highest the last couple of weeks. He's just, he had that play when he ran [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2618.0s)]
*  into contest to play in the corner and just kind of went into the third round. He could stop. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2622.88s)]
*  It's pretty, uh, it's pretty brutal. So the case for Golden State really quick for it to be the [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2628.4s)]
*  late bloomer is just a combo of Jimmy. I don't know what it is about staff. It would be the [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2633.04s)]
*  greatest feature. Somebody wrote, but it just seems like everybody that passes through Steph's [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2641.6s)]
*  life, they turn into Gandhi for like the first three weeks. Like the way they talk about him, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2645.6s)]
*  it's just like this religious experience to be Steph's teammate. And Jimmy is like, so happy, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2650.08s)]
*  like there was that clip of him diagramming plays in the huddle. This is a guy who was just sitting [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2654.72s)]
*  next to the water cooler the last three months of the Miami season. And now he's like, Traymond, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2659.52s)]
*  come here. I have an idea for a high screen. And he's just so invigorated. And I think they're [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2665.52s)]
*  legitimately dangerous looking at their schedule. Um, and they're beating Dallas today as we're [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2670.48s)]
*  taping, but they got Charlotte, Orlando's a mess at Philly. Great at Charlotte at Knicks at nets. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2675.2799999999997s)]
*  Then they have a seven game home stand against Detroit, Portland, Sacramento, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2682.24s)]
*  Knicks, Denver, Milwaukee, Toronto. Like it's a team that could go on like a 12 to two run. And [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2685.52s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised. So that, that would be the other one I'm kind of looking at. I guess the [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2690.72s)]
*  thing that the thing to watch is whether Curry can go up a level again or not. Cause we haven't seen [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2695.2s)]
*  it this year from him. His life looks a lot easier having somebody like Jimmy Butler out there. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2699.8399999999997s)]
*  And the shooting numbers would back it up. The three point shooting would back it up. Even [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2705.92s)]
*  watching the beginning of today's game, even though it wasn't just super aggressive, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2709.36s)]
*  like having Butler just be somebody else that people are worried about. And of course they [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2713.28s)]
*  ran some other play where it's like Curry's the lead block on the cut. So everybody freaks out. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2717.44s)]
*  And then Butler kind of slips a screen and then he's the second cutter behind it. And he's [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2722.6400000000003s)]
*  wide open in a way that, you know, he's probably like, this must be, I just can't imagine playing [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2727.28s)]
*  basketball for a living and then getting the chance. Like no wonder everybody's in a good mood. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2732.56s)]
*  They're like, this is what happens. Like when he moves, all of this other shit happens. And then [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2736.3199999999997s)]
*  now my life is like this much easier. Although I do have to point out on a couple of broadcasts, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2740.9599999999996s)]
*  our memories can't be this short. Like Butler has a nice game. He's super aggressive. I mean, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2747.9199999999996s)]
*  he was taking 10 shots a game from Miami. It was the lowest field goal of teams per game. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2752.3199999999997s)]
*  Not going to foul line at all. Yeah. No, he was actually still was like, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2755.7599999999998s)]
*  not he's, he's one of the most like hyper free throw rate guys in the league because he pump [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2759.2s)]
*  fakes at the rim and guys just go for it all the time. So like if you played him in a series, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2764.72s)]
*  you go, you guys are going to stay down against him. Now he's shooting a million free throws, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2768.8799999999997s)]
*  but he's just more aggressive. Now you can tell he's taken 13 shots a game. Again, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2773.04s)]
*  the shot count goes down because he's taking so many free throws, right? But he, [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2776.48s)]
*  for all the stuff that he talked about in Miami, like they took my joy from me. Like he broke up [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2781.2s)]
*  the quarterback. You're just going like, we just saw this guy destroy his value around the league [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2786.88s)]
*  and he makes a couple of cuts and hit some free throws. And it's like, man, golden state, like, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2796.0800000000004s)]
*  you know, everybody who's golden stays probably still scared to death of like what the longterm [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2801.36s)]
*  thing could be here. But in the short term, it's, it's awesome to see, you know, some of these [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2805.6800000000003s)]
*  possessions late in games where you could just see step being like, I'm running around, I get [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2810.88s)]
*  the ball, I'm trapped. I throw it to somebody else and I don't even want to take some of these [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2816.64s)]
*  shots. And then you have people being like, Oh, his, his shooting is dipping. It's like, well, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2820.96s)]
*  no shit. So I think his life is going to be a lot easier now. I still don't even think they're in [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2826.0s)]
*  the last though. Are they used to having them in the Lakers class? I don't know. I want to watch [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2830.64s)]
*  it for a couple of weeks because like Butler, he's averaging almost 10 free throws a game for [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2835.2799999999997s)]
*  Golden State. As we're taping this, they're beating Dallas by 20 and he's already six for six. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2840.56s)]
*  He's plus 24 in the game, but watching the way he's playing with these guys, it, it's weird. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2846.08s)]
*  It reminded me of when Moss got to the Oh seven paths and was just like, so delighted to be in a [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2851.44s)]
*  real offense with Brady. And he was just like skipping around, right. And just so happy and, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2857.36s)]
*  and, uh, had so much space and knew that if he was going to do whatever the ball was going to be [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2863.6s)]
*  there and Butler watching the space that he has, but also the connection he has with Draymond, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2869.12s)]
*  I wasn't prepared for. I wish we were watching the game right now. Um, but the, the high IQ [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2873.6s)]
*  thing he has with Draymond, I think has been fun to watch where he's posting up and Draymond's at [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2879.6s)]
*  the top. They're playing on this weird two man game, but everybody's so scared of the courage [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2883.8399999999997s)]
*  shooting. Um, I'm, I'm not counting this team out. It reminds me a bit of like when Brian Heideck was [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2887.8399999999997s)]
*  cast as the pool guy and Melrose place. And he was like, look, I'm just, I'm just happy to be here. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2896.64s)]
*  Who was it? Brian who? Heideck. Who's that? I think he's played Brian Heideck. Yeah. He played [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2901.44s)]
*  the pool guy and Melrose place. It just reminds me a lot of that pool guy and Melrose place. I [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2907.8399999999997s)]
*  feel like you're making this up. Google it. Right. Hi, Dick. So is there anybody else you would put [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2912.16s)]
*  on the late bloomer list? Late bloomer list? Uh, is there any, is there any hope for a healthy Orlando? [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2920.16s)]
*  So I had them mark down. They've been so, I mean, they were six and 14 in their last 20. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2928.56s)]
*  So there's only a, their offense in their last, their last month, they're the, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2933.8399999999997s)]
*  they're the third or fourth worst offense in the NBA. And boy, when it's bad on offense for the [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2938.8799999999997s)]
*  magic, I'm surprised it was that high that they were only 27. So the other three had marked down [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2943.2799999999997s)]
*  the last year. It's not going to be Detroit, even though there's a lot of good Detroit numbers for [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2950.16s)]
*  the last 20, 25 games. How many people do you think right now know what seed Detroit is? [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2954.48s)]
*  Yeah. Not only is Detroit for the people listening, probably locked into the sixth seed. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2960.0s)]
*  It's not like an easy series for the Knicks. Like they're going to be favored. I would pick the Knicks, [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2965.7599999999998s)]
*  but I don't know if that's like the easiest series possible for them. The other two teams, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2971.68s)]
*  I have Minnesota, just cause who knows 31 and 26, but maybe that maybe something is Randall playing. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2975.84s)]
*  I'm out. Is that good or bad? Randall's playing you're out. Okay. And then, uh, the only other [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2982.48s)]
*  way, I mean, Dallas, I guess we have to watch, but the only other one I was thinking was the Clippers. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2988.08s)]
*  If, if there's like a long, healthy Kawhi stretch, a bug Donovich resurgence, um, [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2992.96s)]
*  they're really well coached, like the Lakers and, um, you know, could, could something blossom with [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=2999.84s)]
*  them in March. I wouldn't rule it out. All right. More 30 games left subplots. So your, your pick [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3006.48s)]
*  would be the Lakers. I think I agree with you, but I have Golden state a little closer than you do [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3012.2400000000002s)]
*  for a possible late bloomer. Anybody else? Well, I'm glad. I don't think we spent enough time [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3016.88s)]
*  on Minnesota because I think we did 10 seconds on it. And I know they lost in the Houston game. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3021.76s)]
*  That was just kind of a frustrating game. They didn't have Rudy, but that, you know, sometimes [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3028.2400000000002s)]
*  is that play to their strength. Now, when you look at some of the declining Rudy stuff, but then [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3032.1600000000003s)]
*  that also means Houston, you can go small. Cause even Houston against Utah last night, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3036.1600000000003s)]
*  they lost because they were just like Utah size bothered, bothered Houston. Um, and granted [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3040.32s)]
*  Houston's kind of rotating some guys in and out, so they're not playing with like the full cast of [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3047.0400000000004s)]
*  guys. So look, sometimes you're just going to lose to Utah when George decides to go [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3050.96s)]
*  all first team NBA, but let's just say, okay, open, like open to the idea. Like I feel a little bit [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3056.16s)]
*  better about Minnesota maybe than I did because in the beginning of the year, when it was frustrating, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3062.64s)]
*  it was like, this team's healthy and these other teams are hurt and they're losing to these teams. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3066.3199999999997s)]
*  But there's just a Randall stretch here where it's like, man, this, they might just be better [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3072.0s)]
*  without this guy. And they haven't had D even chenso for a month either. You're going to go might for [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3076.64s)]
*  that. They are. I just think they're unquestionably better when he's not out there for them. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3081.6s)]
*  I don't know. I've been watching basketball my whole life, but just he screws up the spacing. He, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3088.88s)]
*  he's might be a good player on other teams for that team. He does not make sense to me. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3093.2799999999997s)]
*  He's good for 20, you know, and it's like, okay, but there's just a lot of other stuff that, [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3098.3199999999997s)]
*  that we'd need for him. So here's what I don't love with Minnesota. Okay. As you know, I'm a, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3102.96s)]
*  I'm on the amp bandwagon. There's been a lot of really high volume field goal games for him. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3109.84s)]
*  Yeah. That I can't really explain. Like even if you just go into the, in, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3117.36s)]
*  in January and February this year, he had a 31 shot game, he had a 29 shot game, uh, 25, 28. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3122.56s)]
*  So just the last two weeks, 28, 25, 28, 33, 18, 32. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3131.44s)]
*  I, I don't think they're winning three playoff rounds with that happening would be my point. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3139.28s)]
*  And I don't really know. I haven't watched enough Minnesota the last three weeks to understand why [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3144.56s)]
*  that's happening, but, um, it's just a lot of three, like he took 14 threes in a game. He took [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3148.48s)]
*  15 threes in a game, 17 and 14, just a lot, you know? And then I look at the free throws, [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3154.56s)]
*  like in one game he had 28, they went by 19, he had 28 shots and 18 free throws. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3161.84s)]
*  25 shots and 15 free throws. It's just, it's a lot of ant. I don't, that's pretty easy to stop when [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3167.68s)]
*  you get to a playoff series. So I wish they had a lot, but I don't know if they have a lot of other [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3173.68s)]
*  choices. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3177.68s)]
*  No, they've done a good job. Like Terrence Shannon has been playing well, Clark, this other young [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3180.4s)]
*  players coming in, he's been good for him defensively. And, um, yeah, like I'm not disagreeing [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3183.92s)]
*  with any of that stuff. I just think there's certain dudes that maybe I defend because I like them, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3191.2000000000003s)]
*  but I think I like and dislike players for very valid reasons. And for the high volume stuff with [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3195.76s)]
*  him, I think it just ends, the ball just ends up back in his hands. And, you know, he's getting [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3200.8s)]
*  trapped, he's getting a ton of attention and it's up to you to figure all that stuff out. I mean, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3206.48s)]
*  he had a play against Houston where he split the screen and it was, it was two defenders that came [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3209.84s)]
*  with him and he just split it in a way where I just couldn't believe and believe like it was [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3216.4s)]
*  physically possible. And then he almost throws it down from there. And then he's like, I'm [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3220.0800000000004s)]
*  going to throw it down from there. And so because he's capable of doing some of that stuff, um, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3224.96s)]
*  I don't know that he wants to take those shots. Like some other players, like again, you just go [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3229.44s)]
*  through the list of guys I don't necessarily like. I think they're totally fine being like, cool. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3233.12s)]
*  You did a good job on the Mello and the, the Lamello usage rate shot rate stuff. You talked [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3236.16s)]
*  about that in your pot a couple of weeks ago. Yeah. Per 100, he's taking the most shots. Yeah. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3240.64s)]
*  Like we haven't seen somebody take that many shots per 100 possessions. That guy should be the all [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3246.48s)]
*  star game. Well, the other reason you got somebody all star votes is somebody pointed out to me after [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3250.56s)]
*  the fact and they're like, do you realize like if you, well, the voting was still open, but if you [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3255.6s)]
*  went to the voting tab, it was done by points per game. So he was like the first option when you went [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3260.0s)]
*  to the page to vote as a fan. So he's popular. They have the top Instagram panels in the NBA, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3264.88s)]
*  him and Lonzo have two of the top five. It's awesome. For most, most, most viewers, like people, [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3272.4s)]
*  people like the balls. Um, we are going to have a lottery ones as well. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3277.52s)]
*  Oh, before I switch topics that Minnesota Houston game, when Dylan Brooks was talking shit to aunt [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3287.6s)]
*  and they got into it a couple of times. And then that game just got more and more competitive [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3295.12s)]
*  and heated and kept going and kept going is in the running for my favorite game of the season. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3299.44s)]
*  I love that game, but I knew like going into it. That was one of those deals where it's like, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3304.72s)]
*  whatever I'm doing tonight, I'm watching Minnesota and Houston. I wonder is Dylan Brooks, [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3309.2s)]
*  does he do that again? Or is he like, all right, here's somebody I shouldn't do that to again. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3313.2s)]
*  Or does he double down on it the next time they play and what happens in a playoff series? [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3317.6s)]
*  Are you serious? You think you're gonna do that? You think you double down? [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3321.2s)]
*  Do you remember him in that Lakers series where people thought his career was over? [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3324.08s)]
*  This is different though with the end. I actually think he might double down because he, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3329.36s)]
*  he might think aunt might punch him in a series and then he would take an out of the series. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3333.52s)]
*  Basically. Well, he did it to LeBron in a way, but LeBron was just not going to fall for it. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3338.48s)]
*  But the thing that turned everybody off. Right. And then Brooks couldn't make a shot. And then [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3345.04s)]
*  he didn't do a media availability in his like, what, nobody likes it better player now though, [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3351.36s)]
*  than he was in that Lakers series. It was an awful Lakers. Like people were going, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3356.72s)]
*  get ready to learn China buddy type of stuff. I mean, he was a China meme dude. And then all of [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3360.96s)]
*  a sudden he gets a huge contract from Houston and to Houston's credit, like they desperately need him. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3365.76s)]
*  And what I liked about that game is this. Amen Thompson progression is like nightly man. You have [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3370.96s)]
*  to watch him every night to see it. And you and I were talking about him. We did that pod for the [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3379.52s)]
*  trade value thing. I was like, yeah, doing this at the worst possible time, cause you're going to [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3385.84s)]
*  lose your shit about Thompson. But I feel good about, I thought we were properly careful while [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3390.16s)]
*  also respecting the mom. Where was he again? He was like 19. Okay. Um, and I had said something [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3397.2799999999997s)]
*  and I remember I was pissed when we did it. I wasn't like mad. I wasn't like mad the next day [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3406.64s)]
*  type of mad, but I was like, you know, are you still going to run like pick and roll for him in [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3410.64s)]
*  a late possession? And you were like, well, they did on the game winner. And I was kind of like, [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3416.48s)]
*  I didn't want to get into it with you. I was like, there's four seconds left. They inbounded it to [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3420.08s)]
*  him and he uses athleticism and he hits the game winner against Boston. The stuff he was doing [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3423.52s)]
*  against Minnesota and even some stuff that I saw last night against Utah, like the drive and kick [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3428.88s)]
*  stuff that he's showing now. And there was a, like granted, we know he can't shoot yet, which is the [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3435.44s)]
*  funniest thing about how much we all love watching plays. Like, you know, the joke is he's not even [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3439.84s)]
*  good yet. And it's this much fun, but he hit a shot because Utah just didn't respect him. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3443.76s)]
*  He hit a shot late last night where it was like, I'm catch and shoot three. Like I'm not even going [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3449.28s)]
*  to Dick around with this. Like I'm getting this shot up. I'm going to make you try to come out [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3453.2000000000003s)]
*  here a little bit more. There's more and more ball handling with him where they trust him, where [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3456.5600000000004s)]
*  these, there could be this amend Thompson reward of these van, these van Vliet minutes as, as like [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3461.5200000000004s)]
*  disrupted as they can be. Cause clearly they need him to organize them on offense, even though they [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3468.32s)]
*  have all these clutch wins, but other clutch numbers stink, which is one of the weirdest profiles. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3473.36s)]
*  Nobody can create a good shot. That's why with Thomas and it's like, at least when he's driving [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3478.88s)]
*  to the basket and he kind of doesn't know where he's going or what's going to happen, but he always [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3484.7200000000003s)]
*  goes by whoever's guarding him. But he kind of does know that like they were getting kickouts [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3489.6s)]
*  in that Minnesota game where it was a very clear, like when he takes off, he's going, if I don't have [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3494.48s)]
*  this, I know where to kick it out. And it's also just awesome having Jabari back as, you know, [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3500.24s)]
*  the stretch option because, you know, it gives you some more flexibility with Shungoon because I'll [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3505.9199999999996s)]
*  admit there's some, as I can't say it, some Shungoon nights where I'm like, what, what's up with him? [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3510.64s)]
*  Are you there at all with that? It just feels like he's depending on the matchup. He's kind of one of [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3519.04s)]
*  those guys. Yeah. And Adams at this point is kind of like, do you know how old Steven Adams is? [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3525.2s)]
*  Isn't he like 28? It's like some crazy number. Yeah. He's 31. Right. But, but he's been in the [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3532.3199999999997s)]
*  league for 25 years. Yeah. I don't think he should be this bad. So having Jabari back is really [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3538.7999999999997s)]
*  important for them. So look, I mean, none of this was- That's one of those where they could have [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3545.3599999999997s)]
*  probably flip Steven Adams and one of the 90 picks they have to get [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3549.52s)]
*  Capella or somebody who could actually play a little bit more for them. I had them on my list [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3554.4s)]
*  for subplots for the last 30 games, cause they're three and eight in their last 11, [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3558.88s)]
*  18th and net. They've dropped to 35 and 21 for the season. And they're a five seed right now, but [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3563.2s)]
*  like if I'm Golden State and I'm five losses back from them with a bunch of time left, I feel like [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3570.08s)]
*  I can catch them. Cause I thought Houston was overachieving with some of the stuff that was [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3575.52s)]
*  happening in them the first two months. The league, their conference is getting better. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3580.4s)]
*  Clippers are better. The Lakers are better. The Warriors are better. And I don't know if they're [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3585.2s)]
*  going to stay in the top six. That would be my pick to drop out. What do you think? I was looking [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3589.52s)]
*  at some of that schedule stuff in the expanded schedule, where if you look at games against [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3594.16s)]
*  teams 500 or more, which you've already gone through the record stuff, but Denver's played [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3597.44s)]
*  26 games against teams with that. And Houston's played 35. So scheduling wise, they've been a [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3600.72s)]
*  little unlucky. But then when you look at the remaining schedule stuff, I mean, it's the top [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3607.2799999999997s)]
*  three most difficult remaining schedules, it's Phoenix, Denver, and LA. Houston's like down at [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3611.12s)]
*  18. So it should, because of that number and the record I told you about, it should even out. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3617.4399999999996s)]
*  Like I can't wait to see what LA does. Torrey missed the game. So, you know, I'm not putting [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3623.4399999999996s)]
*  a ton into the Utah loss. I put way more into the Minnesota win. Because that's one of the subplots [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3629.12s)]
*  that's left is who are the 10 teams going to be? And more importantly, who are the playing teams [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3634.0s)]
*  going to be? And then how can you avoid that eight spot where you have to play OKC in round one, [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3638.0s)]
*  which would just suck no matter who you are. You know, it does feel like Phoenix is going to drop [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3645.68s)]
*  out and we should talk to them. We talk about them. They're 27 and 29. They have three more wins than [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3652.16s)]
*  your Portland Trail Blazers, your favorite team. They're six and then they're last 15, [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3657.12s)]
*  they're 19th and net. I know you talked to Goldsberry about this and you're a pot on Friday, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3661.7599999999998s)]
*  but I sat at that game with Goldsberry and the Suns were absolutely alarming in person. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3665.04s)]
*  Give it to us. Give it to us. There's no other word than body language bill. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3671.3599999999997s)]
*  Oh my God. I mean, we were pretty close to the bench so I could really watch it. It's, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3674.56s)]
*  they weren't talking to each other. You know, you judge certain things like how many guys get up [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3678.7999999999997s)]
*  after a big play on the bench. What are guys doing during timeouts? What happens when a star [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3684.32s)]
*  player walks by his coach? Does he acknowledge him? Does he talk to him? Does he just kind of [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3689.76s)]
*  stop by? Does one of the star players yell at the coach? Well, KD yelled at Bud twice during that [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3694.96s)]
*  game. There was near the end, one of my favorites is when one of the stars, there's somebody [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3701.04s)]
*  shooting free throws at the other end and one of the stars moves to the furthest part of the court [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3709.04s)]
*  away from everybody just to go sulk in the corner. That was KD near the end because he was so mad [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3713.92s)]
*  the way they used them in that game. And the team played like crap. They were playing all the hits [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3718.96s)]
*  and it is not a team that seemed very happy. And I don't know. I actually, we were talking and it [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3724.48s)]
*  was like, I don't think Bud was trying to get fired, but it was the kind of coaching where you [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3731.2000000000003s)]
*  were like, if that guy's trying to get fired out, point back to that game where it's like, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3736.16s)]
*  you're just leaving Grayson Allen out there for the entire crush try and get killed by Darren Fox. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3740.88s)]
*  It was weird. It was a team that was not on the same page in any respect and seemed unhappy. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3744.6400000000003s)]
*  That was my takeaway leaving for two and a half hours, an unhappy team. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3752.7200000000003s)]
*  Trey Lockerbie Yeah, it's not Bud's fault that people can't come over to help on cuts. And [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3755.92s)]
*  Durant had a bunch of those swiping late, out of position. And if you don't believe me, I think [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3760.88s)]
*  Van Gundy was on the broadcast of that one too, being like, what are you doing? And [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3766.08s)]
*  Durant puts up these numbers, but I mean, there's some stuff here. And look, the worst thing Durant [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3771.76s)]
*  did was tweet that the NHL has loyalty and doesn't trade his players, which is still one of the dumbest [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3776.48s)]
*  tweets I've ever seen. Trey Lockerbie Did he do that? When was that? [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3781.2000000000003s)]
*  Trey Lockerbie Yeah. It was during the whole stretch where it's like, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3783.6800000000003s)]
*  why don't you watch something else? And you're like, all right, dude. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3787.2000000000003s)]
*  Trey Lockerbie Yeah, not great. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3790.56s)]
*  Trey Lockerbie When you look at their whole thing here, I don't know, rebound is usually a number [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3792.7200000000003s)]
*  where you see like rebounding decline. It kind of speaks to effort and all that kind of stuff. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3797.84s)]
*  I mean, he's under five rebounds a game in February. The crazy thing is like some of [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3803.04s)]
*  the other numbers are nuts because the guy can't miss a shot right now. The shooting [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3806.96s)]
*  spots are incredible. Free throw attempts are down the last couple of months. So, you know, [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3810.1600000000003s)]
*  I don't know if this is, hey, this is part of this little decline here, but with him, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3814.88s)]
*  but he still gets his numbers because the guy is so brilliant offensively. But like, [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3820.1600000000003s)]
*  you know, it's kind of up to you, man. It's kind of up to you to be a part of the solution here. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3826.32s)]
*  And they tried some different things and they're just not very good. Even when they're [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3831.92s)]
*  Trey Lockerbie You know what they unfortunately tried to do is they tried to trade him and didn't [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3837.04s)]
*  tell him. And I think that was the death knell because, you know, the way the NBA works. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3840.48s)]
*  Trey Lockerbie I don't think he's wanted to be there, man, going back to last summer. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3845.6800000000003s)]
*  Trey Lockerbie You think that this whole season, you don't think you want to be there? [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3848.88s)]
*  No, I don't think I think there was pretty strong indications that if he could have gotten his [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3853.04s)]
*  preference to go somewhere else this summer, he would have done it. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3857.8399999999997s)]
*  Trey Lockerbie Interesting. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3860.0s)]
*  Trey Lockerbie You don't think so? You didn't hear? [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3861.2799999999997s)]
*  Trey Lockerbie I don't know. Well, I never know what to believe with the rant stuff, [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3863.3599999999997s)]
*  but I had always heard that he likes Phoenix. But I think it was a pretty unusual move by them [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3867.2s)]
*  to shop him around quietly with the don't tell anyone in a league where somebody is immediately [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3874.0s)]
*  going to tell somebody. And that's how they found out. I just thought that was the kind of thing [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3879.76s)]
*  you do when you're trying to burn the relationship. Well, Luca never found out. Listen, I test why I [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3884.1600000000003s)]
*  been watching Trey in his whole career. He's at a slightly different point in his career physically. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3890.7200000000003s)]
*  You can see it. He's as amazing as he is. And we've never seen a guy with that kind of size [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3895.84s)]
*  and shooting and athleticism. He's a little bit creakier than he used to be. You can see it when [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3901.36s)]
*  you watch it. And it makes sense because he's been in the league since 2007. Like this is how it goes. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3907.2s)]
*  Trey Lockerbie I don't really enjoy them. I looked at it last year. Remember, we kept waiting. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3915.12s)]
*  Hey, I don't care about any of the stats. And the fourth quarter stuff didn't make any sense. It was [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3922.64s)]
*  so bad. It had to be an anomaly. And that part of it's been fixed a little bit. But even with last [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3926.96s)]
*  year's injuries and guys missing games, they were 38 and 28 through 56. They're 27 and 29 now after [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3931.28s)]
*  an eight and one start. Their bottom third in offense and defense the last month. Katie's only [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3937.92s)]
*  missed 13. Booker's only missed three. The Beale bench thing, it doesn't matter because I don't [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3942.96s)]
*  think that dude cares at all. I just don't. So they needed those three guys to be just top level. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3947.28s)]
*  Not to sound like a soccer analyst. And they rarely gotten that. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3961.04s)]
*  Trey Lockerbie The Beale thing was interesting to watch in person because [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3964.48s)]
*  he was in a funk to start the game and wasn't really trying hard. And then there was a moment [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3969.2799999999997s)]
*  where you could almost seem like, oh shit, this is on TV and there's fans. And then he started [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3975.7599999999998s)]
*  trying harder. But you know, it's an unhappy team. I will promise you that that team does not make [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3980.56s)]
*  the playoffs. There's no solution for whatever is wrong with them. And I don't, you know, [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3986.4s)]
*  it's probably the all time new owner syndrome example we're going to have other than Prokhorov, [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3992.0s)]
*  which I think is number one. Although Dallas in the running. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=3998.1600000000003s)]
*  Fair. Fair. I still think Prokhorov. It's unbelievable. Like I've done this assignment. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4003.76s)]
*  If you go through every ownership transition, the new owners fuck up so bad within the first [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4009.2000000000003s)]
*  12 to 18 months. Like even Cuban, when he brought it in and I never forget him being on with [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4016.32s)]
*  Dan Patrick talking about acquiring Ralph LaFrance. And I remember thinking like, [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4023.2000000000003s)]
*  what the hell is he doing? And then Cuban just so good after 10 minutes of Dan Patrick, I was like, [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4027.92s)]
*  oh, I guess getting Ralph LaFrance is a good idea. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4032.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, think about it. If we bought, if we bought the Pelicans, would we just keep the roster [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4039.28s)]
*  intact for a year or would we just be going out to dinner every night trying to figure out [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4044.16s)]
*  what our first trade was going to be? I feel like they would be the latter. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4048.16s)]
*  I would be so determined if I owned a team to not screw up in the first 18 months, I would just [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4052.48s)]
*  be like, say no to everything. So I think Prokhorov was worse than the Luka trade. And here's why. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4058.8799999999997s)]
*  Because the Luka trade as ridiculous and absurd as it was, and it's going to go down as one of the [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4066.7999999999997s)]
*  worst trades in the history of the league and maybe in the history of sports. So putting that [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4071.76s)]
*  aside, at least there was a strategy in place that I genuinely think they believed. The strategy was [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4076.5600000000004s)]
*  insane. It makes no sense. It made no sense when it happened. It's indefensible, but they had a [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4084.48s)]
*  plan and a strategy. Prokhorov, his plan was let's spend as much money as possible and do whatever [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4091.76s)]
*  it takes. I don't care about picks. Let's keep going, going, going, going. And then it didn't [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4097.92s)]
*  work for a year and he was like, I'm out, no more money. I'm not spending anything. He just zagged [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4102.88s)]
*  the other way, but now they had no more picks left. I just don't feel like anyone's ever going to top [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4107.4400000000005s)]
*  that. Two strategies that one was worse than the other and in the span of two years, and he just [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4111.52s)]
*  demolished basketball at Brooklyn for no reason. Well, the fact that he changed course so quickly [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4118.64s)]
*  after he'd already started digging a hole for a house and going, you know what, it should be over [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4127.04s)]
*  here now. No, you can't. I mean, even then eventually you'd have a house at the end of it. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4132.64s)]
*  So digging a hole for a street, it wasn't even one house. It was like nine houses. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4138.4s)]
*  Which way do you want these highways going? North, south? [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4142.48s)]
*  I didn't realize the sun came that way. I'm out. Let's not do this. Just spelled a lot. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4146.32s)]
*  Yeah. But the problem is there's no single piece that's as damp. I mean, I guess you could get into [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4151.6s)]
*  the Tatum and the draft picks and all that kind of stuff, but they weren't like Tatum wasn't playing [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4157.28s)]
*  for that franchise and having everybody fall in love with them over the course of seven years. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4164.4800000000005s)]
*  The way, like the reaction, like I saw a quote the other day on the Luca trade where somebody [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4169.76s)]
*  had said, we had underestimated the reaction to this. Multiple people said that. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4173.92s)]
*  What did you think was going to happen? And it just sucks even worse because AD gets hurt immediately. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4178.32s)]
*  But the other thing that I love too about this, and I'm going to make this joke throughout the [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4184.48s)]
*  rest of my career is this stupid fucking timeline people do and talk about and how married they are [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4188.719999999999s)]
*  to the age timeline of NBA rosters. Like we need somebody on this timeline. It's like, so if Cooper [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4195.04s)]
*  flag, if you had like the number one pick, would he be too young to put with Kyrie and AD now? [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4201.599999999999s)]
*  Like he's not on our timeline. Yeah. Right. Like as if every rebuilding team, everybody has to be [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4205.599999999999s)]
*  between 18 and 22. And then any team that's like going for championships, like this guy's 25 and [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4210.4s)]
*  good. What the fuck are you guys doing? It's way too much of a cap with the rest of our timeline and [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4215.5199999999995s)]
*  all this stuff. So also the iconic, um, part of the reason you're getting rid of Luca, cause he's not [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4221.679999999999s)]
*  a safe enough risk physically and his devotion to the game. And then you trade for Davis who got [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4228.08s)]
*  hurt an hour into his first game. Like you, or when I thought you nailed it when you were tweeting [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4233.36s)]
*  out about that really good feature with, um, the owner who's, what is he the son-in-law? [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4238.639999999999s)]
*  Married to the fan. Patrick is a Dumont. This is your dream. This is what I want to happen to you. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4246.08s)]
*  You marry into the rich family. That's thinking about getting into professional basketball. This [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4252.4s)]
*  is, this is it. This is the path. No, I like, I go on Instagram and click on the link. I'm [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4256.32s)]
*  no, I like, I go on Instagram and constantly like single daughters of NFL ownership. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4261.68s)]
*  Their pictures I'm like, Oh, I want it, you know, nothing creepy, just really tasteful stuff. Be [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4266.400000000001s)]
*  like, Oh, it's such a great sweater, you know, but that party looks awesome. Yeah. Oh my God. You [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4271.76s)]
*  guys, that's so great. Did you guys reach out to the community like that? Keep, keep doing you. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4279.280000000001s)]
*  Uh, he, he went through all of these players, like clearly like Nico had gotten to Patrick. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4285.76s)]
*  It was like basically to be on brand here. The messaging should be like, we here at the Dallas [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4292.4s)]
*  Mavericks want people that are fully committed and clearly like, look, it's no secret on the [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4297.599999999999s)]
*  Luca thing. He wasn't committed enough. I'm not going to make the argument that he was and was [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4301.44s)]
*  misunderstood, but you can't then run through all the lists of players to be like, you know, Kobe [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4305.44s)]
*  and Shaq when Shaq himself would admit that I could have done a better job. And that was the [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4311.6s)]
*  whole reason of the Kobe Shaq divorce is that Kobe, you know, Phil's line to him being like, [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4319.04s)]
*  your 10 is unattainable for everybody else. Your 10 is their seven and they don't understand that [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4323.92s)]
*  there's a higher number. That's your gift. That's what makes you you. So holding everybody else, [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4329.04s)]
*  that standard is completely pointless. All you're going to be doing is wasting your time. So getting [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4333.92s)]
*  on Shaq's case because he's not going to approach the off season the way you are. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4337.04s)]
*  That's unsolvable, man. And so when he went through the list of players that he admired [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4340.64s)]
*  because of their work ethic and their conditioning and all that stuff, and as much as we all love [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4346.08s)]
*  Shaq, he'd be the first to admit that he didn't take it serious enough while he played. So it was [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4349.2s)]
*  an awful quote. He wouldn't have been in my top 700 to list for that. I remember when John Walsh [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4353.92s)]
*  sat me down and told me that my 10 was everyone else's seven. What did you say? [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4361.5199999999995s)]
*  Thanks, Jeff. Thanks just to relax on everybody. Did he? Did he say that to you? [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4367.44s)]
*  What did he say to you? What's the most meaningful thing that he ever said to you? [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4374.0s)]
*  Most meaningful thing John Walsh ever said to me [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4379.92s)]
*  to care about the relationships with the people you have professionally, because those are things [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4385.36s)]
*  going to last after you do whatever you're doing professionally, which I think took me a long time [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4391.2s)]
*  to realize. Yeah, I didn't realize that until recently. And he didn't say he recommended [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4395.84s)]
*  Game Change, the book, which I did enjoy that summer. It's a good one. It's a good book. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4401.280000000001s)]
*  More storylines for you. I almost don't want to get to Philly. I feel like Philly is like, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4408.24s)]
*  like the the the let me ask you that. Let me ask. Let me ask you a Philly question off of what we [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4414.56s)]
*  just did. No, I want to almost save Philly. Philly is like the fucking huge dessert we [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4419.52s)]
*  have coming out that's got like the table where the guy's going to do like a baked Alaska. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4425.52s)]
*  Like that's how much excited I have talked about. Does anyone actually make a bake? I've never even [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4429.68s)]
*  seen one. It's referenced. It's the most referenced food item that I don't even think exists. Never [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4434.240000000001s)]
*  seen it on a menu. I've never seen a presentation. I've never seen anybody order one. I think it's [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4439.76s)]
*  fake. I think I've had it like once in my life. Philly is 20 and 36. They have the six worst [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4444.320000000001s)]
*  for record in the league. They've lost seven straight and they owe a top six picks to OKC. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4451.44s)]
*  And now they're in the zone where it's like, should we just fucking, should we tank it? What [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4456.719999999999s)]
*  do we do? And it's funny, I wrote down, could this hit mid 2010 Brooklyn proportions for them? [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4461.28s)]
*  Or I was thinking of like the single bleakest situations we've seen in the NBA. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4468.0s)]
*  And I think the bleakest they can get, and I've certainly rooted for Celtics teams that had pieces [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4472.719999999999s)]
*  of it like that when the Vin Baker trade, when it was became clear that there was no way of getting [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4478.32s)]
*  out of his contract and you just start looking ahead and you're like, wow, this is so we're going [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4482.24s)]
*  to have this for three more years and we're just fucked. And that slow realization comes in. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4487.679999999999s)]
*  And I think it's hitting some of the Sixers fans with the, with the George and bead money. So you [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4494.32s)]
*  have that on top of, you might give the seventh pick in the draft to OKC. You might not even get [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4498.799999999999s)]
*  a draft pick out of this season. If you can't land the plane on this lottery, what would you do? [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4505.12s)]
*  I would tank. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4510.24s)]
*  So you're shutting everybody down. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4512.72s)]
*  Yeah. There's no point. Why? Why is this NBA thing going to look better this year? [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4514.48s)]
*  It's not, it's not going to look better tomorrow. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4521.76s)]
*  And then Paul George, he's like, yeah, my finger, I'm taking shots. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4526.88s)]
*  It's like, well, why can't you move? [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4531.12s)]
*  Why do you seem slow half the time? But are there other injuries you have that you're not telling [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4533.28s)]
*  us about? If I were CEO of a company and I wanted to short my own stock, but I couldn't just say it [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4537.599999999999s)]
*  outright, I would hire Paul George to run PR. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4544.16s)]
*  What are they doing over there? [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4551.44s)]
*  We do feel like we went strongly enough on us being concerned from the moment they did that contract [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4554.08s)]
*  to the start of the season, because I feel like we both of us danced around, including in combos [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4560.88s)]
*  with each other recorded where I was trying to be diplomatic, but deep down in my soul, I just felt [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4565.4400000000005s)]
*  like this was a bad fit and it's been way worse than I thought. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4571.52s)]
*  See, the problem with it was, is that on one hand you have Darrell pulling a rabbit out of his hat [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4575.68s)]
*  in a way that very few GMs can, you know, whether it's having a top five player in the world when [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4582.16s)]
*  he's healthy and in bead, because that's what he was, but he's a great player. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4586.72s)]
*  But even if you don't like him now, and I don't like him now, you have a guy who's going to make [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4591.36s)]
*  multiple All-Star teams, most likely in Maxi, you hit what 21st pick and then all these other little [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4597.2s)]
*  things and you delay the Maxi extension. You figure out a way to move Harden out because you knew [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4602.96s)]
*  after that playoff series, it's like, I don't really want to extend this guy to whatever was [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4609.2s)]
*  talked about and how many different versions of that story you've heard. And then you have this [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4612.96s)]
*  cap space that almost never works out for anybody. And then you have this rare instance where the, [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4616.96s)]
*  you know, in this case, the Clippers, the incumbent team, right, decide they're okay losing the asset [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4624.16s)]
*  for nothing and not giving this player who's all NBA level a fourth year. Like everybody just gives [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4633.76s)]
*  them the fourth year. Like, why are you not giving them the fourth year? So you have this one team [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4640.4800000000005s)]
*  that's deciding to not give the fourth year. And it's not like they weren't going to pay him a ton [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4644.16s)]
*  of money in the three years, but they're not going to give him the fourth year. Like, who cares? Just [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4647.92s)]
*  do the fourth year. You figure it out later. It's better than just letting him walk. And they let [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4652.639999999999s)]
*  him walk. So now you can use this cap space on a guy who in theory is all NBA, even if we would say [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4655.92s)]
*  that he feels like with all of his talent, like at the end of it, Paul George is probably going to be [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4660.16s)]
*  kind of a disappointing player for his career. And now he's even worse. Like when they've needed him, [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4666.16s)]
*  when other guys have been out and you've needed him to be this alpha, he's just incapable of it. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4672.08s)]
*  And then on top, so like it's all of this credit on top of, to your point, like is George personality [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4676.0s)]
*  wise, the guy that fits into Philadelphia and knowing what the standard is and knowing what the [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4681.92s)]
*  expectations are. And it's been, is it more disappointing than Phoenix? [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4686.4s)]
*  Well, I'm personally more disappointed because we had Phoenix in that big super boost, [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4693.5199999999995s)]
*  which I haven't lost all decade. So that was kind of like, like all of us were aligned on, [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4700.48s)]
*  we think Phoenix is going to be really good. I can't wait to watch this offense and they've [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4706.08s)]
*  all been healthy, which is the weird part. So, I mean, to me, that's almost more surprising. I can't [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4710.24s)]
*  say I'm, I can't say I'm surprised that Embiid broke down and that Paul George looks a little [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4716.16s)]
*  long in the tooth. What's surprising to me is how miserable everybody seems. And the fact that [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4721.04s)]
*  there's no outs, like to go 20 and 36 is really hard. Right. That's, that's a bad record. You're [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4729.12s)]
*  on, you now you're on pace for what's that? Like 27 and 55. Like you're just, there's a reason [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4736.24s)]
*  there in the standings. Can I push back on one Paul George thing though? Yep. Cause you said, [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4744.72s)]
*  ultimately you're going to remember him as like kind of disappointing. I think he's exactly, [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4750.64s)]
*  it was exactly the best version of whatever career we ever would have thought it was going to be. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4755.68s)]
*  I don't like he made, he made conference finals a couple of times. He had that one nice [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4762.24s)]
*  playoff series with the Clippers after Kawhi left. He also had a couple where he was that great. I [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4767.04s)]
*  still like, I would still take him over Vince Carter and Carmelo and people like that from a [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4771.92s)]
*  success standpoint. You take him over Mello? I wouldn't take him as, as a player from like, [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4775.92s)]
*  I have Mello ranked in the top 75, but I'm just saying like his achievements. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4782.88s)]
*  I think he's achieved more than Carmelo did as a player. Like he made it further in the playoffs [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4787.92s)]
*  twice or three times. He was in the conference finals three times and he was second team all [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4792.8s)]
*  NBA. If Mello had been in the East, I think he probably like, if you go through all the Mello [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4799.2s)]
*  playoffs stuff for the most part, every time he lost to a team, it was a team they were supposed [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4804.16s)]
*  to lose to. I've heard that argument, but it doesn't explain Oh nine when I felt like they [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4807.92s)]
*  pretty easily could have beaten the Lakers. And I don't feel like he had a good enough [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4813.2s)]
*  series personally. That's fine. In that series. All right. Paul George was 2019 first team all in [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4816.4800000000005s)]
*  Bay. I don't know. I think he said, uh, if you're going to compare him versus Carmelo and I was a [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4824.24s)]
*  Carmelo defender forever. Um, but I also feel like now Carmelo has become a little overrated [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4828.32s)]
*  in retirement, which I think happens depending on if you have a podcast after retirement or not. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4833.68s)]
*  Um, I don't know. We were there for the Carmelo thing. He was an incredible score, [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4838.8s)]
*  but the Denver years pretty much all the way through until 2009 were disappointing, [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4844.240000000001s)]
*  right? Then pushing his way to the Knicks and making them basically trade all of these assets [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4849.68s)]
*  that actually could help them if he stayed. I think that he gets dinged on that. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4854.96s)]
*  Yeah, there's not, there's nothing. He doesn't even have a moment. You know, that used to be [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4858.5599999999995s)]
*  my Vince Carter argument was like, where's the playoff moment is for the longest time. And I [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4861.679999999999s)]
*  know you'll be right down the middle on this one. Like people were actually trying to argue like [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4866.24s)]
*  Paul Pierce against Vince Carter before the Oh, wait, title. And you would just go, come on, [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4869.679999999999s)]
*  you know, this is, there's a, there's a level to like, you've got to have some kind of playoff [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4874.48s)]
*  moment. And for Vince for the longest time, like he didn't have anything. I mean, it might have [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4878.48s)]
*  taken all the way until like he hit a corner three for the first time. And then he was like, [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4881.839999999999s)]
*  I mean, it might have taken all the way until like he hit a corner three for Dallas. So maybe it's [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4885.76s)]
*  just cause Paul George at one point was in this conversation of like, could this guy be the best [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4891.12s)]
*  player in the league? And, you know, I guess you could do the same thing with Mello because early [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4895.04s)]
*  on that's kind of how you looked at Mello and then the playoff part of it. I can't sit here and [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4899.92s)]
*  defend it because it's generally really disappointing. But I think for George and some of those Pacers [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4904.8s)]
*  years, you were like, is this guy, and then it took forever for him to have like a playoff [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4910.0s)]
*  series. You felt like you could trust him. And that, that was like hard nests, you know, for him, [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4914.32s)]
*  it was like, what is going on? And then they had, they had lost Kawhi. They had that Utah series or [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4919.679999999999s)]
*  Utah, I think had that really good record and that two year window. They, you know, they kind of [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4923.84s)]
*  got Gobert stuck in the spot. We was trying to defend everybody. So he was really, really good. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4928.88s)]
*  It was like, okay, well that's like, finally, like there's something there to kind of point to there [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4933.2s)]
*  a little bit, but he just needs to be, I mean, we're back to the beginning of this whole thing. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4936.5599999999995s)]
*  He is incredibly disappointed, but he's so bad right now that I can't believe he's doing podcasts. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4941.44s)]
*  You tell him, take a break. I would just be so embarrassed. Paul's going to be taking a month off. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4948.799999999999s)]
*  Obviously that's not going to happen, but I would be embarrassed being a dude who comes in with the [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4954.5599999999995s)]
*  four year max and like, Hey, we need you to be the guy throughout all this and beat stuff, you know, [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4961.12s)]
*  and Max, these numbers aren't as good. Cause I think Maxie was pressing and trying to go like, [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4967.12s)]
*  all right, I guess I'm going to take 25 shots and I have to raise the risk of like, what's some of [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4971.76s)]
*  my shots are here. I mean, what is there any part of this that you would disagree with? Cause I'm, [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4975.28s)]
*  even if he's older and all this different stuff, like man, year one, this is what it looks like. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4979.68s)]
*  It's just so frustrating. Well, what would scare me for affiliate fans is we've seen this with [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4985.2s)]
*  other players that all of a sudden we're at a different level and you know it right away. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4990.16s)]
*  Like I always remember Jermaine O'Neal and Jermaine O'Neal had those two years through [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=4996.16s)]
*  he's getting traded around and people are still acting like he was 24 and 10. Jermaine O'Neal [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5000.24s)]
*  just wasn't anymore. Usually when the stats drop this dramatically, they don't come back. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5003.92s)]
*  That's, that's what we've learned. You can go on basketball reference. You can look at any of these [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5011.5199999999995s)]
*  guys. There's some sort of level, especially if it's second half of your career, when your stats go [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5016.08s)]
*  from like here to here and that's just who you become. And we think it's coming back and it just [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5021.6s)]
*  never does. I'm still going to defend Paul George's 2019. I feel like that was a really good year. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5026.160000000001s)]
*  Even like that Phoenix series, like he was kind of carrying them. It was like he had kind of reached [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5033.4400000000005s)]
*  his, the 2019 OKC year was good. And then that, I don't know what it was for Carmelo. What is it? [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5039.120000000001s)]
*  The 2013 next season, the regular season. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5047.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. But you know what, dude, I'm sorry. I actually going to repush back on your pushback [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5052.48s)]
*  because it's a double pushback. Yeah. Right. Because if you look at the Thunder [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5057.12s)]
*  during those post Durant seasons, like they're getting blasted out in the first round. They [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5062.32s)]
*  lost to Portland in five games the year he was third in MVP voting. You know, and he has one of [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5068.639999999999s)]
*  those horrible, horrible game sevens where you don't even notice that he's out there. And like, [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5074.08s)]
*  look, we joke, we've made this joke before. You know, it's a really simple test. Like, [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5079.12s)]
*  do I forget you're out on the court? Paul George should never be somebody with his skills, [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5083.2s)]
*  with that contract, with Philly's injuries this year, where you forget that he's on the court in [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5088.48s)]
*  the fourth quarter. And it happens all the time. It would be a fun podcast just to discuss Paul [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5092.5599999999995s)]
*  George's career for two hours. There's been a lot of ups and downs because the bubble was really bad. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5096.88s)]
*  The year after was really great. You could go over the map of it. A couple more storylines quickly. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5100.96s)]
*  Let me just finish this Clippers point though. Oh, please do. Because, you know, their defensive [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5107.92s)]
*  profile is incredible. Lawrence Frank in this front office, they deserve all the credit in the [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5113.28s)]
*  world for doing something that I just don't think a lot of teams would have done. Most teams would [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5118.4s)]
*  have given Paul George the fourth year. And to your point, like maybe that tells you something if they [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5122.32s)]
*  were so adamant of not doing it. But then again, it's like, well, it wasn't like he was going to [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5126.56s)]
*  play for free in the other three years. But I just laugh when I think about the Clippers [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5129.44s)]
*  transactions this year, because it's almost like, hey, who are all the players that Cilla doesn't [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5133.12s)]
*  like? Let's bring them in. The hardened one they need. They need his usage, the highest usage that [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5136.639999999999s)]
*  we've seen from him in five years. But it's not just that. I mean, they have brought in [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5142.0s)]
*  Kevin Porter Jr., who they moved on from, who, you know, you want to talk about playing your own game [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5146.96s)]
*  when you're out there on top of all the other shit you can get into with him. Bones, who couldn't make [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5152.16s)]
*  it work with Jokic. Like if they're like, hey, man, all you had to do was cut. All you had to do [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5157.12s)]
*  was cut and you would have gotten second contract. It would have worked out. Mo Bamba, who is going [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5162.96s)]
*  to just forever trick teams. They brought in Kai Jones. Okay. And then they were like, while we're [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5169.12s)]
*  at it, let's add Ben Simmons. This is an absolute anti-Risillo heater of roster movement. And they're [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5175.68s)]
*  and they're pretty good. I kind of like the Ben Simmons move. Oh, do you? I didn't mind it. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5182.48s)]
*  Pay nothing for him. He costs like five bucks. I tell you that guy is like, all right, this Brooklyn [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5189.92s)]
*  thing's over. And then, you know, I just love that it was actually like a story of like, Ooh, we're [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5195.84s)]
*  on Ben Simmons, buyout watch. And it's like, of course he gets to go to LA. Of course he does. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5199.76s)]
*  Good for him. It's a nice team for him. Hey Ben, just play some defense and bring the ball up for us. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5205.28s)]
*  Can do that. Occasionally do the thing where you drive really hard and then kick it back out. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5210.64s)]
*  Somebody saw what we need from you. Grab some rebounds. And if you want to make, if you want [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5214.64s)]
*  to make all your off season videos, make them. I, if I'm paying Ben Simmons the minimum, I'm [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5219.04s)]
*  okay with it. If I'm paying $43 million a year for him, not as okay. Some quick storylines quickly. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5225.04s)]
*  Is John Moran ever going to be John Moran again? Awesome question. Awesome question. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5231.76s)]
*  Uh, yeah, he's still young enough, but I've been worried this year. You 34 games. He's missed 22. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5237.84s)]
*  He's averaging 20 a game, 30% from three free throw attempts down to 5.9. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5247.84s)]
*  They're 23 11 with him 14 and eight without them. And there's moments and flashes, but [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5254.88s)]
*  I was kind of expecting more from this season. We'll see. Maybe this, this is why maybe Memphis [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5261.6s)]
*  could be the late bloom or even though they have a good record, could he just go on a heater? The [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5266.72s)]
*  next 20 games and look like Jagan, but it's, it's not the guy from three years ago. I'll tell you [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5271.52s)]
*  that much, at least not yet. No, it isn't. And I do wonder if it's kind of like the, [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5276.16s)]
*  the disruptive pattern for him, like, Hey, he's back. He's not back, but I know they'll rest [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5282.08s)]
*  him sometimes in there as well. It just, it feels like a 25. Like I'm not there yet, but [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5287.2s)]
*  watching it. Yeah. Yeah. Be good for four weeks in a row with you. Yeah. Put up like a 28 and 10 [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5293.76s)]
*  for a month. So I'm watching that and it's hard to take Memphis seriously, not knowing what we're [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5300.56s)]
*  getting from that dude. Even though I love like Jaren Jackson, I think has been one of the big [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5306.240000000001s)]
*  winners of the season. I thought he went up a level. It's noticeable. He's going to, he's an [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5309.84s)]
*  all NBA guy for me right now. John was really going against Orlando because Orlando never [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5315.280000000001s)]
*  changes defense the entire time. So that was good. Cleveland versus OKC for home court, [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5320.24s)]
*  46 and 10 versus 45 and 10 taping it before both of their games today. But I think that's the [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5325.44s)]
*  storyline at some point because one of those teams could get a game seven and those are the only two [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5330.5599999999995s)]
*  teams left. Same thing for MVP where it's SGA versus York, which although it seems like SGA is [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5335.76s)]
*  kind of got it locked up. He's minus 500. It would take a lot at this point. Next one. This [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5342.32s)]
*  is specifically for you. Can the Pistons, how frisky can we get? How much friskiness should I [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5346.88s)]
*  be prepared for? Do I need to put on a frisky jacket to combat their friskiness right now? [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5352.56s)]
*  Are you suggesting a seasonal friskiness update ranking? What do you think the record is in their [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5364.32s)]
*  last 28 games? Last 28? I'll say 18 and 10. 19 and 9. Last 20 games, they're seventh and net. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5370.32s)]
*  Cade Cunningham, your guy, you never gave up on him. You own the most amount of stock. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5381.44s)]
*  You were just buying other people's stock when they were down and he's averaging 25 and 9. And [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5387.28s)]
*  as if we kept track of who was the best player in that game as an award, I feel like he would [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5392.96s)]
*  have about 25 of them, 20 of them, 19 of them, 22 somewhere in there. But he's been awesome and [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5398.48s)]
*  they can rebound and they're tough. That's what I like. They're tough. It's a tough like kind of, [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5405.28s)]
*  it's a veteran team and with some wild cards, beef stews out there. There's some elbows. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5410.639999999999s)]
*  Did you see that Duran dunk the other night? What was it? Just, he almost got like horizontal [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5415.599999999999s)]
*  to the ground, like at rim level. I don't know what was going on. Because I was watching, [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5422.4s)]
*  I forget which show I watched again, Sports Consultants available per diem. I guess we should [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5427.36s)]
*  say Pro Rata. But there was a show the other day I was watching where they were showing like [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5433.92s)]
*  something from track and field. There was a track and field meet and they were showing the high [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5442.48s)]
*  jumper and he was like jumping over the thing where he would, like there was no Fosbury flop. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5447.12s)]
*  He just jumped over it. Oh my God, really? Yeah. So there was no one apparently on the set that [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5453.04s)]
*  would have been like, Hey, you realize no one would ever do a high jump this way. Yeah. And [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5458.56s)]
*  they didn't do it. And if you had Duran out there, he'd be like, this is how you do it. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5462.72s)]
*  Cause it looked like he was trying to high jump the rim when he hit this dunk. I'm so happy. I [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5466.64s)]
*  think scholars will look back at the Zach Cramm, Cade Cunningham tablets as the turning point of [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5470.96s)]
*  his career. Cause Zach did a piece that was like lit them up. Like, Hey, this is who this dude is. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5476.24s)]
*  An incredibly high volume, inefficient dude who may not have like one go-to thing. That's all that [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5482.56s)]
*  great. And it feels like from that point on, he became the player we all thought he could be. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5488.240000000001s)]
*  So I think the tablets will be a turning point on his. Interesting. Maybe he'll get invited to the [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5491.84s)]
*  hall of fame. The, when Cade goes, uh, I actually was, I've been sketching out all MBA every week, [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5496.320000000001s)]
*  just for as an exercise. Good for you getting those reps in when no one's looking. Just part of the pod [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5504.080000000001s)]
*  process. I have Cade. I think, I think there's a real case for him for second team all MBA right [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5509.28s)]
*  now. Who are your four guards? Well, you figure Mitchell, like SGA Mitchell, our first team [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5516.08s)]
*  and Brunson is going to be second team. And if you're going to, if you're going to go at least [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5525.36s)]
*  a little traditional and say, I want to put a guard as my fourth, you know, but basically the [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5529.759999999999s)]
*  fourth guard and second team on BA it's between him and Edwards. And I think that's really it. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5536.5599999999995s)]
*  What about Kyrie? Kyrie's in there and Curry's in there. If you're, if you're betting on the [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5542.48s)]
*  Curry bump, um, I had Kyrie and Curry and Edwards all 13, but I mean, it's all like, I didn't really, [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5547.759999999999s)]
*  I spent five minutes on it, but I was just, I was like, I wonder where Cade is. And Cade to me with [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5553.919999999999s)]
*  what he's done with Detroit, they lose Ivy and they somehow keep going and how hard he plays [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5560.24s)]
*  every night. I'd have trouble leaving them off second team right now. It's him or Edwards. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5566.16s)]
*  And you can talk me into Edwards because of the defense and, but you know, they have the same [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5571.04s)]
*  teams have the same record and you could say Edwards has more talent. So at least it's a good [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5575.04s)]
*  argument. So anyway, um, Cade would have on there. So the reason I wanted to mention them though, [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5579.76s)]
*  is cause I think they're going to be kind of a bitch in the playoffs just for one round. I don't, [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5587.28s)]
*  I don't necessarily think they're going to beat the Knicks. I just think they're going to be [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5593.52s)]
*  really physical, super excited to be there. And they have a really good guy at the end of these [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5598.0s)]
*  games. Who's not afraid of whoever the best guy on the other team is. And, um, it's an unusual [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5603.200000000001s)]
*  six seed for a conference that I think is pretty awful. Once you get past the first four, [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5608.0s)]
*  it's amazing what shooting can do when you have, uh, like a guy is going to have the ball in his [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5614.72s)]
*  hands as much as Kate, because I've watched an Orlando game recently and we all love Palo. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5619.44s)]
*  I think that established and whenever I watch them, I just think of like, [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5626.32s)]
*  there's just not enough spacing because Suggs is out. Right. This is too hard. It's like, [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5631.759999999999s)]
*  if there was ever a team that would love a prime stretch five per Zingas to balance out all the [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5637.44s)]
*  other stuff the guys could do. And it's not like they had this massive overhaul this off season [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5644.8s)]
*  because all the young assets essentially are still there. Although Killian, how about his possessions [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5650.24s)]
*  and passing the other night was, was KLC wrong or just early summer? KLC still stay. He never gave [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5654.56s)]
*  up a stock. He's still holding on. Killian back in the league, just the simplicity of a little [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5661.4400000000005s)]
*  bit more spacing. You know, it's what every team, maybe there's just not enough shooting to go [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5665.84s)]
*  around, but every team should aspire to do that. Cause it's just different. Your job is different. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5670.24s)]
*  Now as his primary ball handler, when there's just some people that you have to worry about. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5673.52s)]
*  And look, last night's Denver games, a perfect example, the Lakers did not worry about any of [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5677.360000000001s)]
*  those other guys all night. So a couple more subplots and then we'll go. I mentioned the all [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5681.040000000001s)]
*  NBA battles. What's weird is the top five seem like they're locked in unless a Mitchell Brunson [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5688.400000000001s)]
*  development can happen. But I don't know how Mitchell's, if Cleveland's going to have the [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5694.400000000001s)]
*  best record in the East and maybe the best record in the league, he's probably going to be first team. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5697.68s)]
*  Anyway, worst rookie of the year race in a while. Castles, Castles minus one 75 on Fandel. It [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5702.96s)]
*  doesn't even start for the, I went to the game Thursday. I didn't start, um, 10th playoff spot, [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5710.64s)]
*  Russian roulette in the East, Orlando seven, Miami eight, a game and a half back at Atlanta [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5716.96s)]
*  nine at 26 and 30. And then you have three teams that legitimately don't want to even make the [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5726.4s)]
*  playing game. Chicago at 10, 22 and 34, Philly 20 and 36 now, and then, or 35 and then Brooklyn [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5731.04s)]
*  20 and 35 Chicago, Philly and Brooklyn. I don't think want to be in the playoffs. Maybe Philly's [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5737.76s)]
*  just going to have to stumble into it. You realize though this top, like they're, they have the sixth [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5742.64s)]
*  worst record right now. Imagine if they tank and end up with the seventh pick and it goes to OKC, [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5748.0s)]
*  which is almost what happened at Dallas that year. And then Dallas ended up keeping the pick and [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5752.96s)]
*  getting lively. Remember they are right on the edge. Yeah. And everybody lost their minds because [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5756.56s)]
*  they didn't want to be a 10 seed when it was like actually smart for them. I know. Yeah. Right. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5760.4s)]
*  I'm looking right at you. I was talking about you right here. Right here. Is this shit. You're, [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5766.4s)]
*  you still bothered. You ever drive around and you're going down sunset. You're like, [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5770.5599999999995s)]
*  I'll tell you what though. Fucking mavs a couple of years ago. Have you done zero times? I still [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5773.92s)]
*  stand by my foundation. You know what? I look back at my playbook and, uh, the thought process [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5778.16s)]
*  was you have Luca Dacic. You always have a chance that that guy's in your team. The next year they [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5784.24s)]
*  made the finals. Was that wrong? Um, I think the criticism was outsized for what they actually [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5788.0s)]
*  were doing. Um, I have no idea who's going to be the 10th seed and what it'll be funny as if it [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5793.92s)]
*  ends up being Chicago, which I think would be the team I would bet on out of those three Chicago, [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5799.04s)]
*  a team that, uh, openly tried to sabotage their own team at the trade deadline and, uh, and still [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5803.68s)]
*  might make the playoffs. So you have that, then you have tank a Palooza, the Cooper flag stuff's [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5808.48s)]
*  heating up. Washington has a four, four win lead over everyone else. They have nine wins, [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5813.2s)]
*  New Orleans, Utah, Charlotte, Toronto, Philly is our, our top six. And Utah's hilarious because [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5819.92s)]
*  every once in a while they look really good. Like I watched some of the, some of the Houston game [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5826.96s)]
*  and Houston was really trying to win and Utah's like, nah, we're going to do this and, [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5832.5599999999995s)]
*  and watch this and then we'll do this. And, um, they just look really competent from time to time. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5836.48s)]
*  And I don't know how they're going to fuck up, but they seem pretty happy where they are. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5841.2s)]
*  Or then they'll run a play where Keontae George in that Lakers game that I was at, [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5845.36s)]
*  I almost tweeted it out. Like, will you remember where you were when they came out of a timeout [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5849.84s)]
*  and Keontae George threw up a left-handed floater in the lane? I think it was actually a left-handed [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5853.679999999999s)]
*  jumper. I, maybe it wasn't out of a timeout. There was another play out of a timeout where I think [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5859.36s)]
*  they turned the ball over immediately. They have a lot of on-ball guys with confidence. I will say [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5862.639999999999s)]
*  that about the Utah Jazz, but who do you want to have win? If you could go right now, win. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5867.12s)]
*  Cause I mean, if you think scoot and Cooper flag the next 10 years over under three and a half titles. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5874.16s)]
*  Trying to think how many did the mid eighties Lakers when they won five, [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5882.88s)]
*  nine finals in 12 years. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5888.24s)]
*  Listen, if this season, if any great thing happened through 50 games, other than Dallas [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5890.080000000001s)]
*  making the dumbest trade I've ever seen, we might be alive with scoot. We haven't talked about this [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5896.0s)]
*  on a pod. We might be alive. We might be. There's it's still breathing. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5901.4400000000005s)]
*  There's enough there and he's young enough that I feel okay. This isn't like where I was mentally, [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5908.72s)]
*  you know, a month and a half ago with this, where it felt like a sunk cost. Now I'm, [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5916.0s)]
*  you know, he's gotten better. He's getting so big. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5920.320000000001s)]
*  Last thing and Dallas got killed as we were taking this to go and state, but [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5925.84s)]
*  they're not getting their bigs back until the first week of March. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5931.04s)]
*  What do you, where do you have them in your head? [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5935.92s)]
*  Cause that's another sort of plot for the last 30 games. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5939.12s)]
*  I'll probably like them better than the Clippers. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5941.5199999999995s)]
*  I might even like them better than here's the thing. I liked them. I liked the healthy them. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5944.719999999999s)]
*  I thought they were better this year before all this trade stuff. Like they were always a team [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5950.0s)]
*  that I had to say, don't, don't lose sight of them with all of this Lucas stuff. Like I think Denver [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5955.2s)]
*  paid this weird Aaron Gordon price where people were looking at what they were doing or what they [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5959.759999999999s)]
*  weren't doing. And you go, I don't really care. Like, I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5964.0s)]
*  I don't care about what they were doing or what they weren't doing. And you go, I don't really care. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5969.04s)]
*  Like if Aaron Gordon's going to midst this many games, he's so important to what they do. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5972.4800000000005s)]
*  Let's see what they look like when they get him back. And clearly Lucas, even beyond that [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5976.240000000001s)]
*  and 80s even beyond that for Aaron Gordon on that part of it. So I, I think you still have to keep [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5980.0s)]
*  it open for them. Even though, I mean, imagine having three centers like this that you would [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5986.4800000000005s)]
*  feel so good about and none of them are playing. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5991.04s)]
*  Well, the good news for them, it looks like they're going to keep the 10 seed no matter what [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5992.88s)]
*  happens unless Phoenix gets their shit together, which I don't think will happen. And I didn't make [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=5998.32s)]
*  Wembe a subplot because we already know how that's going to play out. It's such a bummer. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6003.36s)]
*  I thought San Antonio was kind of lurking as a party crasher for maybe a nine or a 10 seed, but now [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6007.6s)]
*  that one shot and they're going to sink back. And the Wembe thing is a bummer. We don't, there's [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6015.52s)]
*  really not a lot to say about that one. So if I had to bet, so Sacramento you would have as a 10 [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6020.56s)]
*  seed 30 games left. Is there anything you've seen from Sacramento that got you excited since all the [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6026.72s)]
*  trades? [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6031.120000000001s)]
*  I don't, I don't think it's going to be, you think it's going to be San Antonio on the 10? [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6036.0s)]
*  No, I think San Antonio is out. I have Phoenix and San Antonio out and I have Sacramento as, as the [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6040.080000000001s)]
*  10. I think that's how that plays out. And maybe Dallas passes them and becomes the 10 and [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6045.36s)]
*  Sacramento is not. And, but I think that's something, it looks something like that. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6050.799999999999s)]
*  I think it's Sacramento. I mean, at least with Sacramento, I kind of know what I'm getting. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6055.04s)]
*  I know I know. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6060.0s)]
*  It's a good to see Subonis and Valenshinis back for you. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6060.719999999999s)]
*  I've loved it. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6064.32s)]
*  You said you see those guys. I know you watched a lot of Lithuanian Olympic tape. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6065.04s)]
*  All right. Any other subplots before we go that you want to see? [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6069.2s)]
*  Um, all right. Any other subplots before we go that you care about? [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6072.24s)]
*  No, I care about you sending me a deep dive thing that you've been just YouTube and out, [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6076.0s)]
*  like a high school kid with no friends. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6079.84s)]
*  You want to do that really quick? [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6081.599999999999s)]
*  I do. Cause I have one for you. Cause you gave me the assignment. Mine'll be quick, [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6082.96s)]
*  but I know you really want to do this. So go for it. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6086.4s)]
*  No, I asked you, I said, we should talk at the end of the pod or near the end of the pod every Sunday [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6089.04s)]
*  about one rabbit hole we fell into over the course of the week. Cause I think we both fall into a [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6096.08s)]
*  rabbit hole. So either a book rabbit hole or, um, some sort of YouTube or somebody sends you [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6101.2s)]
*  a video and you're like, what's that? And then you're watching seven of them. Um, [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6108.5599999999995s)]
*  I w we want to talk about this Lauren Michaels book I was reading, but we don't have to do that [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6113.2s)]
*  today. So somebody sent me a Reddit thread about the silver Springs performance by Fleetwood Mac [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6116.32s)]
*  in 1997 in the dance. I don't know if you're familiar with this. I'm not. I mean, I'm, you [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6126.88s)]
*  know, look, who doesn't love a little Fleetwood Mac in the background, but go for it. Well, [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6132.4800000000005s)]
*  so this is why, this is why the deep dive so much fun. Um, so Stevie Nicks and Lindsay Buckingham, [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6136.32s)]
*  they're together as a band in the early seventies and then they ended up joining Fleetwood Mac, [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6144.08s)]
*  right? Both of them together and they're dating and they're in a hot relationship and [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6148.96s)]
*  they write the first album there together. Rumors, the most famous album they made. Um, [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6152.96s)]
*  they broke up as they're making that album. And then a couple other people in the band broke up [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6159.04s)]
*  too. Basically everybody in the band's breaking up with something with their day in the band. And [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6164.16s)]
*  that's what the album becomes. So they cut out silver Springs, which is this song she wrote about [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6167.44s)]
*  Lindsay Buckingham and they cut it out of rumors. It's a great song. They put it on the B side and [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6174.0s)]
*  it becomes one of the biggest albums ever. But silver Springs is the B side and she's mad about [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6181.12s)]
*  it forever. Cause it's one of her best songs. So when they do the dance, now they've broken up. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6186.0s)]
*  Lindsay's with somebody and they go on stage and they do this and they rehearse it and she's playing [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6192.719999999999s)]
*  it the same. But then when they do it for the actual concert film and the album, she, she really [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6198.799999999999s)]
*  gets into it and starts like kind of staring them, giving some side-eye stares as she's doing it, [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6207.04s)]
*  all performative. I think I've seen this. It's one of the best clips on YouTube is Stevie Nicks [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6213.36s)]
*  by the last like minute and a half of the song and he's just playing and now she's like turning [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6220.56s)]
*  over and walking toward him. And she's now like, and her eyes are starting to bulge out and she's [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6224.88s)]
*  like, you'll never forget. I forget the lyrics, the voice of the woman that haunts you. And she's [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6231.44s)]
*  just like yelling it out and he's just like, all right, cool. And he's just playing the guitar. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6239.5199999999995s)]
*  That must've made him want to get back together. Well, and then at the end, she's like, the lyrics [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6245.12s)]
*  in the song are you'll never get away from the voice of the woman that loves you. And she's like, [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6249.28s)]
*  you'll never get away. You'll never get away. And she's like, and it's a thing. And it's become an, [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6253.28s)]
*  ever since YouTube popped up, it's become a thing. And then there's all these theories about the [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6259.44s)]
*  performance, how much of it was performative, how much it was a stage. This Reddit thread that I got [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6264.48s)]
*  sent was about how they're preparing to do this comeback thing. And they might've gotten involved [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6269.12s)]
*  a little bit again. And because they have these different interviews where they're talking about [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6276.719999999999s)]
*  what a good place they're in. And they're, they have interviews together where they seem a little [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6283.679999999999s)]
*  lovey-dovey and maybe, maybe some sparks will fly. Maybe not. But then by the time they do the dance, [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6287.92s)]
*  it's clear to her that she, that he's with somebody else, like for whatever, because [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6296.32s)]
*  here's the piece. He has a kid the next summer. So this is what the thread. That's evidence. That's [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6302.64s)]
*  usually good evidence. Yeah. With somebody else, by the time they do this performance, [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6308.16s)]
*  he probably knew they were having the kid. And this was when it maybe died for Lindsay. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6313.44s)]
*  So the theory was for Stevie. So the theory was when she's singing this, it's like within a few [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6318.88s)]
*  weeks of after she found out, maybe they don't have a chance to get back together. And she's pouring [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6324.4s)]
*  it on in the thing, but then it's a legendary YouTube clip. Anyway, I read, I spent an hour and [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6329.36s)]
*  a half reading everything I could read about this on the internet yesterday at 2 30 in the morning, [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6333.839999999999s)]
*  Boston time. I think that's time well spent. Thank you. That's good. Cause I'll get into [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6339.12s)]
*  a band, whether it's new or something I want to revisit. And I'll be like, all right, I'm going [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6345.04s)]
*  to read about Dwayne Allman for an hour, you know? So actually to kind of like this stuff. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6352.48s)]
*  It's the seventies music stuff. Everybody's got a story that is with at least worth an hour of [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6357.76s)]
*  your time that goes in a bunch of different directions. The other thing I found out was [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6363.68s)]
*  there's a 1977 performance of silver Springs. Cause people thought they never really played it [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6368.16s)]
*  that much. That's on YouTube in black and white of like an original performance of her, like right [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6372.32s)]
*  after they broke up singing it. So I watched that too. Anyway, cause I'll go through some like [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6378.0s)]
*  talking heads phases. I love them. And I, I like them so much that, you know, again, it's, I'm not [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6382.16s)]
*  going to get to experience it the way people get to experience when it first happened. But I always [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6387.12s)]
*  think like I'm having Les Claypool of Primus on at some point here soon, who's generally considered [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6390.48s)]
*  one of the best bass players of all time. And in the beginning with Primus, you were just like, [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6396.0s)]
*  what the fuck is this? And I'm, I'm so fascinated to think of like what it was like when Les Claypool [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6400.8s)]
*  was like, well, I want to make the bass, the feature thing, and I'm going to sing these songs [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6406.32s)]
*  and they're going to be a little different. And my voice is probably not the most traditional rock [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6409.44s)]
*  star kind of voice. But then once you kind of buy into the whole thing, you just appreciate how [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6413.36s)]
*  great the music is and how great he is. But I can't imagine how people told him in the beginning, [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6417.44s)]
*  like, are you kidding? This isn't going to work. And when I think about the talking heads, [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6421.2s)]
*  I just imagine was New York so cool? Cause I read that, please kill me punk book about [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6425.679999999999s)]
*  just punk in New York City. Yeah. And I, I'm glad I read it. And I'm also like, it was so disgusting [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6431.679999999999s)]
*  that I couldn't, you know what I mean? Like I'm going to get through this. It was so gross [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6438.719999999999s)]
*  so many spots and I certainly don't feel like a prude, but after a while you're like, all right, [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6444.0s)]
*  I got it. It was a weird time. Um, [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6448.879999999999s)]
*  wait, can I read you silver Springs letters really quick? And then you go to your deep dive. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6451.92s)]
*  Yeah, but you have to say a couple of samplings. No, I'm not saying [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6456.64s)]
*  time cast the spell on you, but you won't forget me. I know I could have loved you, [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6461.4400000000005s)]
*  but you would not let me. I know that and then later I'll follow you down to the sound of [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6466.4800000000005s)]
*  my voice will haunt you. Give me just the chance. You'll never get away from the sound of the woman [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6473.6s)]
*  that loves you. This is when she kicks it up in the, in the performance. And then the end is, [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6479.28s)]
*  was I such a fool? I'll follow you down to the sound of my voice will haunt you. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6484.0s)]
*  Give me just a chance. You'll never get away from the sound of a woman that loves you. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6488.8s)]
*  And then it just keeps going and going and going. Yeah. Anyway, it all played out on stage and it's [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6493.599999999999s)]
*  amazing. And it's one of the best YouTube clips. She screams your man, you man whore, I think too [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6499.84s)]
*  in there. No, I don't remember that part. Okay. Yeah. So I referenced her, I think at the very top, [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6505.36s)]
*  I'm reading all three volumes of Susan Wise Bowers. The first one is the history of the ancient world. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6512.24s)]
*  And I just love it. She's a complete pragmatist about things and I'm going through some of the [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6523.12s)]
*  early Egyptian dynasties. And so I just finished the chapters on the pyramids. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6529.44s)]
*  And I don't understand why people love conspiracy so much. I know it's conspiracy build. This may be [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6535.2s)]
*  offensive to you, but usually there's a very simple, the, the Occam's razor, you know, what's [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6542.48s)]
*  the simplest explanation? Be like, that's probably what it is. So there was another author, [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6548.639999999999s)]
*  um, a Swiss author named Eric Von Dynakin, who wrote this book about how aliens essentially [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6555.2s)]
*  built the pyramids. And he wrote this book in the sixties and it did really well. And then, [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6565.280000000001s)]
*  you know, you always kind of wondered like, what the hell's going on over there in Egypt? [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6569.6s)]
*  And if I had a kid and I couldn't answer that, I, you know, again, it's probably why I'm not a parent. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6573.84s)]
*  You don't have a kid? [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6578.64s)]
*  No, but I feel like ill equipped. If I had had a kid, it was like, what's up with the pyramids? [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6579.6s)]
*  I go, you know, shit, he's got me. I haven't done a ton of research. And I want to just go [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6583.68s)]
*  based on the Swiss authors thing from the 1960s. But Susan's explanation of it, like after you read [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6588.4800000000005s)]
*  literally two pages bill about the history of like how the pyramids get started, like one small, [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6595.6s)]
*  it's six levels up. So the next guy's like, well, mine's going to be seven. And then the next guy's [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6602.64s)]
*  like, well, I'm going to do like eight, but then that one doesn't get finished. Then another one [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6608.400000000001s)]
*  doesn't get finished. Then there's another one called the bent pyramid where they're just kind [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6612.0s)]
*  of like moving them further away from everywhere. The previous one is built by the way. And that's [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6616.48s)]
*  called the bent pyramid because they realized halfway through construction, if their angles [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6622.64s)]
*  are off and it's going to be too steep and then it's not going to hold up. So they have to like [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6626.16s)]
*  flatten it out a little bit. So there's physical visual evidence to this day of what would be kind [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6630.0s)]
*  of man's attempt at building these great works. And she just goes like, look, this one was small. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6638.56s)]
*  Then they tried to build this one. It didn't really work. This one was unfinished. And then [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6646.56s)]
*  this one's like really screwed up. And yeah, they've done a good job with the corners and it's a [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6651.84s)]
*  massive undertaking, but they just basically ask their citizens based on the Pharaoh's power of [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6657.200000000001s)]
*  like, no, this is what we're doing, dude. Like we're building it and we're moving these stones [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6661.52s)]
*  around and it can take forever, but we're going to leave you some water and maybe like a sarong [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6665.6s)]
*  or something. And then they master, like any civilization, they become better at building [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6670.64s)]
*  these things. And all it took was like a couple of pages for me to go, okay, well that's the answer. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6676.96s)]
*  Like that's it. So now you're set. Yeah. So I'm going to have a kid is my point because now I can [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6682.8s)]
*  answer that question. What you just laid out reminded me of what happened in Vegas when they [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6687.84s)]
*  were building the casinos and the themes got stupider and stupider. And they were like, [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6692.48s)]
*  we're going to have a casino. It's, it's New York, New York. It's going to be like going to [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6697.36s)]
*  New York in a casino. And then somebody else would be like, Whoa, I'm going to make a casino [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6703.599999999999s)]
*  called Aladdin. And we just go. And it's like, it's like being in a fantasy. And then somebody [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6709.679999999999s)]
*  else was like, I'm going to create Paris and it's just going to be like going to Paris, [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6717.12s)]
*  except somebody else said, I'm doing Venetian and it's going to be like going to Italy. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6722.24s)]
*  Some of these casinos stayed and then other ones just, you know, failed miserably. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6726.96s)]
*  That's a really good, it's exactly, well, it's not exactly because I don't think anybody's ever [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6731.599999999999s)]
*  accused, uh, despite some of the weird Vegas stuff of ever being built by aliens, but like [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6736.72s)]
*  not being educated on it and going, yeah, what is going on? Is it, is it actually a perfect [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6741.84s)]
*  representation of all this mathematical stuff? Is it a reflection of the stars? Like all of these [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6746.96s)]
*  theories that I've heard over and over again. And then I never thought of like the simplest approach [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6753.12s)]
*  to it is that here's the first one. Here's the second one, third, fourth. And like, by the time, [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6756.96s)]
*  I think it's like the sixth or seventh one. It's like, okay, now we've really got this thing locked [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6761.5199999999995s)]
*  in because we've been trying to build these things for years and years and you go, oh, [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6766.16s)]
*  wow. All right. Yeah. That actually makes a ton of sense. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6771.5199999999995s)]
*  I wonder if that's going to happen with NBA trades where the KD trade was basically your version of [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6775.599999999999s)]
*  them completely fucking up that last pyramid before they got better at it. Or maybe the Luca [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6781.68s)]
*  trade will be the last one and then we'll just get better at trades from that point on. Maybe not. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6787.92s)]
*  That'll never happen. No, they'll still mess up some pyramids. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6792.64s)]
*  They'll probably still mess up some trades. It's 2025 and Luca just got traded. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6798.0s)]
*  That should have been a 1975 trade. Yeah. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6804.320000000001s)]
*  It was really funny sitting next to my dad because he's like an old married couple with [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6808.56s)]
*  the Celtics team because he's been watching these guys so long. And so like the start of the second [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6812.240000000001s)]
*  quarter, Jaylen Tatum's out and it's going to be like Jaylen's five minutes where it's like [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6817.36s)]
*  that part of the concert where it's like Keith Richards has a new song for you and he's going [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6822.88s)]
*  to come out and play like his song. And my dad's just like, watch this. Jaylen's just going to, [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6827.2s)]
*  he's just going to try to get some shots off. Like this is, we just watch what's going to, [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6832.96s)]
*  and it was like, he knows the team. He's been going to the games too long. He knows like every [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6837.44s)]
*  part of it. And it was just really funny because our record is like 39 and 15 and we won the title [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6841.68s)]
*  last year. And it just proved to me, my 77 year old dad, you're just never going to be happy with [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6848.0s)]
*  sports. He's complaining about Jaylen who's awesome. I think because they get older and I'm going [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6852.08s)]
*  through this a little bit with my dad where like he'll complain about something sports related. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6858.32s)]
*  And I just go, what, what are you talking about, man? Like what do you not, do you not watch, [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6862.96s)]
*  is your father not watching enough, enough like other games? [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6867.84s)]
*  Will he watch other NBA games in a non-selfish life? Well, he'll watch the TNT ABC sometime, [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6872.4800000000005s)]
*  but he watches every self's game, which is kind of adorable because that's how he finds out sometimes [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6877.4400000000005s)]
*  about other teams. Like guys, like he wants to see Wemby right before the break. And it was his first [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6883.6s)]
*  Wemby game. And it was just his scouting report really made me laugh because it was like, he's so [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6890.96s)]
*  long. You think you have them and then he blocks it. I was like, yeah. Yeah. That's what it's like. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6896.88s)]
*  I think it's a common thing with guys past a certain age is they're just so much older. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6904.24s)]
*  They're selfish. They're incredibly selfish about what they want from their sports teams. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6910.96s)]
*  Yeah. I don't know if it's a counting down the years. I'm not trying to be like morbid about [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6915.52s)]
*  this, but it's possible. It like my father can be so incredibly difficult. Like I went to a sporting [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6919.2s)]
*  event with him and now meanwhile, the guy hasn't had to pay for a ticket because I've helped him. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6926.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. You know, which I'm happy to do as a payback for all the years that he took me to all the games [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6930.72s)]
*  growing up. But like if the Celtics get up big, he'll want the other team to make a run for his [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6935.44s)]
*  sole entertainment. Just to make it more fun? Yeah. And I'll just be like, Hey, you can't, [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6941.679999999999s)]
*  you can't fucking be doing that. All right. Like you can't, you can't be rooting on the other team [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6945.44s)]
*  for this five minute window. And he's like, well, I only get to a couple of these a year. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6950.16s)]
*  It's like, well, you know what? You didn't pay for anything. The seat is awesome. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6953.679999999999s)]
*  And you need to not root for the calves for six minutes, just so you get not only a win, [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6959.919999999999s)]
*  but a close one. Yeah. Well, I like with the older fans, how cut and dry it becomes. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6968.0s)]
*  Like my dad just wanted the Red Sox to sign Bregman. He's like, we need a right hand hitter. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6975.839999999999s)]
*  He's going to be good in Fenway. He looked up no stats. None. He had no, there was no, there was [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6980.24s)]
*  no average annual salary home road splits. These guys don't care. No, he's like, we need a right [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6987.28s)]
*  hand hitter. And he's been really good in Fenway. He can't, you know, he can't lay down any of the [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6993.5199999999995s)]
*  stats of Bregman actually in Fenway, but that's just where he stands. And that's the way it is. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=6999.12s)]
*  Yeah. See that's, that's always like the funny thing with, you know, we're terrible because [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7003.84s)]
*  we live it, but your dad, and I don't even mean your dad or my dad, but everybody listening to [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7010.16s)]
*  this right now, like your dad's advanced scouting is if the guy had two doubles in like a three game [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7017.12s)]
*  series once. It's the Doc Rivers has a GM strategy of when I played Byron Mullins that time when he [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7022.8s)]
*  hit those threes, we got to get them. Was there any part of you that immediately looked up Bregman's [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7028.4s)]
*  deal and then compared it to the average annual salary of Mookie Betts? No, I didn't do that, [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7035.2s)]
*  but I will say I didn't think it was, I looked at his stats and noticed that he hadn't had a [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7040.5599999999995s)]
*  really awesome year since 2019, which made me nervous, but then MLB released their top hundred [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7044.96s)]
*  players and he was like 57. I was like, yeah, baby Bregman kind of sucked me back a little bit. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7050.96s)]
*  The Red Sox had four of the top hundred. Well, I'm all over baseball America again. I renewed [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7058.4s)]
*  my subscription at a benefit of years. Right, the prospects. Yeah, big farm. I mean, that was my [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7065.12s)]
*  lunch reading for years and years. Little Christian Campbell, little Marcelo Mayer, Derek Harding. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7069.12s)]
*  Little Roman Anthony. Yeah. The Bregman thing pissed me off just because I can't think of [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7074.48s)]
*  any transaction without Mookie. I'm surprised. I would say 38 year old Bill probably have [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7081.2s)]
*  7,500 words on the Mookie Luka thing. No, you know what? I have 20 words for you right now. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7087.92s)]
*  The Luka trade made me feel better about Mookie. It actually, it was a trade that was so much worse [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7095.5199999999995s)]
*  than the Mookie trade, which was reprehensible and awful. Cause at least we won the title with Mookie. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7102.32s)]
*  Like they never even won the title with Luka. Then they traded them for, you know, they probably got [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7108.240000000001s)]
*  more in the trade. But I really identified with the Mavs fans because what they were feeling after [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7112.64s)]
*  the trade was like Red Sox fans on steroids and HGH, how we felt with Mookie. But at least with [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7120.0s)]
*  the Mookie thing, we had time to prepare and it seemed like it was headed that way for a year. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7127.76s)]
*  It's like, oh man, they're going to fight. This is not going to end well. Luka, they had no idea. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7133.200000000001s)]
*  No, there was a lot of preparation on the Mookie thing and I know it's not fair to do [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7138.56s)]
*  average annual salary because the Bregman thing can be a one year deal. But you know, one of the [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7142.0s)]
*  things about like these commitments for these position players that historically been so bad [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7147.76s)]
*  at baseball with him, you figure he was going to age right. And he just go like, look, what his [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7151.6s)]
*  deal will be in seven years average annual salary compared to like what you're signing for now. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7157.6s)]
*  And then what it will be as salaries keep going up. Although, you know, that's another topic that [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7162.24s)]
*  we could probably spend a lot of time on. Cause I thought that ESPN baseball news was crazy. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7167.04s)]
*  Like it was like, wow, you guys are actually opting out of live rights. You're going to do it. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7171.44s)]
*  And then Manfred just daggers. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7178.24s)]
*  We didn't want to be on a declining platform or whatever he said that I couldn't believe that. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7185.04s)]
*  But you know, he's, he's setting the table because he needs to negotiate with other people. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7190.08s)]
*  And he's trying to make it seem like ESPN was a bad partner. And that's why our ratings were down [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7195.76s)]
*  because they didn't push the game. I get why he did it. It's just really unusual. But I think [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7199.92s)]
*  baseball is a local sport. And I think we've known that for 10 years and you and I personally talked [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7204.4s)]
*  about it 10 times. I don't think people want to sit there. Oh, it's Sunday night. I'm going to [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7208.4s)]
*  watch the Cincinnati Reds play the Milwaukee Brewers. Like nobody's doing that. And if they're [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7211.84s)]
*  not anymore, I'll be years old. Do you remember when you used to do it? Cause I did it [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7217.12s)]
*  religiously. I didn't matter who was playing with Sunday night baseball and I couldn't wait. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7221.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, these are over. All right, we got to go. Uh, Rossello good to see you. We'll see you next [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7226.16s)]
*  Sunday and, and, uh, next Sunday when, when Celtic city starts the last segment of the pod, [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7230.96s)]
*  we're going to do some sort of topic based off of whatever the first episode was. So [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7235.92s)]
*  that'd be good to get some Celtics content in the pod fired up. That's what the people wanted. They [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7241.12s)]
*  kept asking. Good to see you, Rossello. Good to see you. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnIhtK_6LzM&t=7245.84s)]
