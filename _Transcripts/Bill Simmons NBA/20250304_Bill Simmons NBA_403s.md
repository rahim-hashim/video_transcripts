# Kyrie’s Injury and the Year From Hell for Mavericks Fans | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU)
*  Want to talk about Kyrie Irving, uh, and the Dallas Mavericks in this crazy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=0.0s)]
*  situation Kyrie out for the year towards ACL came out today and Kyrie is I've [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=4.8s)]
*  had a roller coaster ride with over the years where didn't really like them on [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=9.88s)]
*  Cleveland. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=12.86s)]
*  LeBron showed up really liked them. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=13.8s)]
*  Didn't like them as much came to my favorite team, uh, was all in it ended. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=16.44s)]
*  Couldn't ended worse became probably my least favorite basketball player. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=22.52s)]
*  It goes to Brooklyn. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=26.2s)]
*  That goes terrible. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=27.84s)]
*  Goes to Dallas. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=28.900000000000002s)]
*  You guys are so stupid. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=29.84s)]
*  And then over the last two years or last maybe a year and a half, I really [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=31.16s)]
*  grew to like him as a basketball player. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=35.2s)]
*  I liked the, I liked how he talked about everything, how he took some [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=37.2s)]
*  responsibility. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=41.0s)]
*  It was like everything I wanted from an athlete. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=41.88s)]
*  I really liked watching him and I grew to respect and like him as a player. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  And, uh, they make this Luca trade. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=48.32s)]
*  It is the least popular, most shocking, most indefensible trade in the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=50.92s)]
*  history of the league. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=55.620000000000005s)]
*  It's getting worse by the day. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=56.44s)]
*  The fans are just so angry. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=58.08s)]
*  They are like scorned lovers multiplied by a hundred. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=60.76s)]
*  They raised the season ticket prices this week. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=63.92s)]
*  Everybody goes nuts again. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=66.0s)]
*  This is the angriest fan base that we've had in a while. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=67.44s)]
*  And here's Kyrie who's by the way, they're putting crazy minutes on him. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=71.74s)]
*  He's in the 2010 draft or 2011 draft. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  He's been in the league for a while. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=81.32s)]
*  He's a point guard. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=82.36s)]
*  He's playing the last six weeks, 38.7 minutes, which led the league. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=83.68s)]
*  So they're throwing this huge burden on a guy who hasn't exactly been Cal [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=87.8s)]
*  Rivkin Jr. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=91.56s)]
*  And, uh, and they're talking about how they rebuilt themselves. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=93.16s)]
*  This was about a title window. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=96.52s)]
*  They trade for Davis. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=98.44s)]
*  He gets hurt in the first game. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=99.36s)]
*  They put this crazy load on Kyrie. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=100.96s)]
*  He breaks down. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  Uh, it's after the trade deadline. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=104.32s)]
*  They have their first round pick next year. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  And what we've seen with this injury over the years is it's, it's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=109.4s)]
*  almost a two year injury. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=112.64s)]
*  You lose the guy this year, but even when he comes back, we saw this [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=113.84s)]
*  happen with Jamal Murray in Denver. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=117.6s)]
*  They're not either they don't come back the season after when they come back. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=118.96s)]
*  They're not, you know, not, not the same person. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  So you almost have to think you lose a year and a half. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=125.83999999999999s)]
*  They don't have control of their own pick from 27 to 30. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=128.16s)]
*  And on top of this, they have to watch Luca who's already rejuvenated. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=131.56s)]
*  You can see it who, when we talk about face to the league, face to the league, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=137.72s)]
*  like Luca on the most famous basketball franchise we have, all due respect to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=140.72s)]
*  the Celtics, uh, you can watch the Celtic city documentary, but the Lakers, I [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=145.56s)]
*  think are the, the premier franchise in the league, the Celtics are the most [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=149.4s)]
*  successful, the Lakers are in LA. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=153.52s)]
*  They've had the most stars. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=156.4s)]
*  Luca's in there now. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=158.16000000000003s)]
*  There's an energy that's completely different at these games. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=159.16000000000003s)]
*  And the Maverick fans who already got kicked in the nuts with this [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=162.56s)]
*  trade in the worst way I think we've ever seen in basketball. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=166.44s)]
*  Now they have to watch this guy blossom as their team already just fell apart. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=170.08s)]
*  And, you know, I tweeted this earlier today and I really, I really mean it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=174.12s)]
*  I went to, um, those three 2011 finals games in Dallas when, uh, they came back [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=178.56s)]
*  and they beat Miami, they actually lost the first game, which was Dwayne Wade. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=184.72000000000003s)]
*  I think the best game I've ever seen him play. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  Um, and then they come back, they win game four, they win game five. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=190.28s)]
*  And a big reason they won those games was their crowd was incredible. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  I don't know where they rank in the best basketball fan bases, but for me, they're [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=199.0s)]
*  in the top seven and you know, I used to love the Warriors fan base even [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=202.64s)]
*  before the Curry stuff happened. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=207.04s)]
*  There's the Knicks, no matter how bad the teams are. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=208.48s)]
*  If you went to a game and they liked the team, it was just a great place to see a [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=210.95999999999998s)]
*  game, you could feel the love. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=214.76s)]
*  And I really feel like the Dallas fans, everything they had built from 1980 on, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=215.92s)]
*  like had gotten to that level. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=220.32s)]
*  They really loved this team. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=221.48s)]
*  They appreciated Dirk. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=223.39999999999998s)]
*  Um, they really wanted him to come through. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=225.23999999999998s)]
*  And then in those, those three games, especially the last two, and they [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=227.79999999999998s)]
*  started to shift the narrative on Dirk and you could just really feel the love [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=232.16s)]
*  and the pure euphoria. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=235.76s)]
*  Um, and then Luca shows up, becomes their guy and they're like, we're in, we [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=238.4s)]
*  have 20 air season tickets for this dude. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=243.28s)]
*  We'll buy his jerseys. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=245.32s)]
*  We love this guy. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=247.0s)]
*  This is our guy. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=247.76s)]
*  We'll, we'll have some ups and downs. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=248.64s)]
*  Maybe he won't always be in shape, but this guy's special and we're going to [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  win the title with him and it's going to be amazing. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=253.64s)]
*  And the trade pulled that away. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=256.68s)]
*  They're still pissed about it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=258.28s)]
*  Now you have this. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=259.52s)]
*  And this situation is not so bad. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=261.12s)]
*  We were joking after it happened that the real reason the family that [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=263.32s)]
*  owns the team did this is because they wanted a sabotage basketball in Dallas [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=267.4s)]
*  and move it to Vegas, uh, move the team to Vegas because the Dallas team, the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=271.08s)]
*  Dallas fans would hate them so much. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=276.08s)]
*  That you'd almost have to move. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=278.68s)]
*  It's almost like there's a precedent of this, like George Shin and Charlotte. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=280.08s)]
*  He, his name became so bad in Charlotte that he actually moved the team in New [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=283.56s)]
*  Orleans. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=287.36s)]
*  It's obviously ridiculous. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=288.84s)]
*  It would never happen, but that, but the Kyrie injury on, on, on top of everything [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=290.4s)]
*  else is the first time where I started thinking to myself, Holy shit. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=294.36s)]
*  Like that, that's actually how bad this might get where they might have to be [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=298.64s)]
*  like, Hey, can we have the Vegas expansion team and said, and we'll just [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=302.2s)]
*  sell Dallas, um, and maybe, or make Dallas the expansion team, or we'll move [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=306.12s)]
*  operations to Vegas and you can make Dallas the expansion team and the call [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=310.64s)]
*  out the Mavericks and keep it the history. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=314.56s)]
*  That's how bad this is. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=316.84000000000003s)]
*  Um, and I'm really feeling for the Mavs today because the combo of that trade, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=318.52s)]
*  losing Davis in his first game and then losing Kyrie for a year and a half, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=322.92s)]
*  probably. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=327.24s)]
*  Um, it's, I honestly can't think of another NBA situation like this where a [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=328.24s)]
*  fan base has taken in the teeth like this. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=334.76s)]
*  So shout out to them. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=337.12s)]
*  I think it's a sad basketball day because Kyrie was playing great. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=338.68s)]
*  I loved watching him. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=342.24s)]
*  Um, this really feels like this kills the Mavericks now for the rest of the [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=343.52s)]
*  decade. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTYsHxryqU&t=346.88s)]
