# Bill and Ryenâ€™s All-NBA Teams | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-LqCNqs2Q8)
*  First team, OMBA. So I guess we have the same. Jokic, Luka, SGA, Janis, and Jason Tatum is my five.
*  We do. Any thought to having Brunson?
*  Yeah, a lot of thought actually. And here's where I landed. Tatum was 27,
*  eight and five. I don't want to do the thing where we just read math when we do the OMBA stuff,
*  but his stats are...
*  Give me his free throw attempts per game.
*  Free throw attempts, 6.8.
*  Oh.
*  He played over 2,600 minutes. He was 12.2 net, which was I think first in the league.
*  The case for Tatum is this. The team was the best team in the league by far. He was the biggest
*  reason because he got better as an offensive thinker, picking his spots. I just thought there
*  was a sophistication that was a slight level above where he was last year. I thought his rebounding
*  was really good, especially in games where they really needed it. The defense, I thought he was
*  a two-way guy was way more committed this year, game to game than maybe he used to be.
*  The engine of this team was Tatum and Brown together and how hard those guys just wanted
*  to win every night. And really the record could have been better than 64 and 18.
*  When you think about how many dumb games that team lost, in the dumb game win-loss,
*  the swing, seesaw, they're probably like minus four. It really was like a 67-68 win team.
*  With that said, the clutch stuff was bad and it's been well documented. If you're talking about why
*  you leave them off the MVP ballot, the crunch time offense just wasn't that good. I think
*  that's the negative. The positive though is this. I think Tatum and Brown specifically sacrificed
*  some numbers for this team to succeed the way they did. And if you put them in different
*  situations, I think Tatum, if you want it to average 31, 32 a game, I think he could.
*  And I think if Jalen Brown want to average 27, 28 a game, I think he could. But I think those guys
*  gave up something to be part of what this team did, which is why both of them have to be all
*  NBA guys for minutes here. That's the SGA point is that if the team gets better,
*  he should probably be taking less shots. Some of the maxi stuff that you have to talk about is you
*  go, maxi is awesome. He's in the conversation for me for third team. I think he's the betting
*  favorite for most improved player, but there's also a massive shot spike. And that's the part
*  of the Brunson conversation where you go, okay, the last, however, three months, he's taken almost
*  25 shots per game. And the fact that he's kept that up, I think it's at least a little bit fair.
*  And I still end up having Brunson fifth and MVP over Tatum. But when you talk about sacrifice,
*  that's a sign of, well, okay, the team is better. It wouldn't make any sense for Tatum or Brown to
*  be guys at 23, 24. Once you're north of 22, 23 shot attempts per game, it usually means the rest
*  of your team is so bad offensively, or you're just like a ridiculous human being. And Brunson,
*  I think it was really by necessity in the fact that he stayed at 49, 48, 47%.
*  And 40% from three. Yeah.
*  And by the way, in April, after Brunson had a bit of a free throw decline, I hate to say this,
*  after all the hard work, there's a few games now where I'm starting to notice some stuff on the
*  free throw deal where I'm like, wait, we did so much hard work, guys. We finally got there.
*  Because Brunson had had a pretty significant drop off going back to March, and then he was at nine
*  free throw attempts again. So some of the raw numbers are also your situation. So I would agree
*  with the point on Tatum. It's good that he doesn't have the opportunity to take that many shots,
*  because it's a reflection of how deep the team is and also maturing. Because it's like, okay,
*  cool. What do you want to do? Do you want to score 35 or do you want to win some games and
*  have everybody feel involved? He made the right choice, but I think he gets credit for that.
*  I will say this, Tatum has been prominent now for the entire time he's been in the league.
*  Even as a rookie, the Celtics were really good. So there's never really been a moment when he
*  wasn't relevant. I do think he's been around so long that people kind of miss how unique he is
*  as a player. The size that he has, his ability to guard. Him and Jalen both can guard all types
*  of players on the other side from all sizes. And the fact that if you need some rebounds,
*  there's just things that he brings to the table that is pretty uncommon.
*  I think Durant feel the same way about him to some degree this Phoenix season that he had, where
*  there was times when he was their rim protector. There was times when he was really their only
*  rebounder. And I think that's the piece with Tatum. I just think people are used to Tatum.
*  So now you start like, Oh, look at this clutch numbers and start picking it apart.
*  All right. Second team, OMBA, Rossello. I'm guessing we had the same four.
*  And then the fifth one is a wild card. Jalen Brunson, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, and Kawhi
*  Leonard as four of the five. Do you have those four in your second team OMBA? I do.
*  Before we get to the fifth spot, we did the Brunson credentials. We talked about AD in
*  the first segment who had his best year, I think since probably 2018 and played a ton of minutes
*  too. Durant. Do you know Durant played almost 2800 minutes this year, which is his most since 2014?
*  This is a recurring theme of the OMBA this year. A lot of guys set like minute highs.
*  He hasn't played this many minutes in 10 years. He's basically 27, seven and five. He was almost
*  the 50, 40, 90 guy. Played 37 minutes a game, which is nuts. His usage was under 30. He had a great
*  season. That team was a little weird and a little off. I didn't love the body language all the time,
*  but it seems like they've settled in a good place. And then Kawhi, who ends up at 68 games,
*  somehow played 2330 for minutes, which is his most since 2017. Another guy,
*  24, six and four, almost a 50, 40, 90 guy. I missed it by one percentage on the free throws.
*  Played 68 games plus 8.2 net and had stretches where it just seemed like he was one of the five
*  best players in the league. So we agree on those four and we can move to the fifth guy unless you
*  have anything else to say about those four. Yeah, Durant, oddly enough, like if you look at some of
*  the numbers from last year, some of the advanced stuff, he's dropped off pretty significant in PER,
*  dropped off pretty significantly in the wind shares of 48 because the true shooting percentage dipped
*  and then his free throw rate dipped. But I would say there were too many moments in the course of
*  the season where I'm like, wait, what other forwards am I going to put ahead of him when I've already
*  put the two ahead of him with the honors and paid them? And then the Kawhi discussion, we agree there.
*  So whatever you want to look at there with the Durant part of it, it's 74 games in the season,
*  as you already mentioned, the minutes and Phoenix. Okay, fine. They weren't a top three seed,
*  but it's not like they suck. Yeah. So I think there's just a lot of, a lot of pro Durant arguments
*  in there. I went with Ant as the other guard on my second team. So did I. 26, five and five.
*  He played almost 2800 minutes. His advanced numbers were surprisingly good across the board.
*  And I think there's a lot of room to grow for him, especially at three point shooting. The big thing
*  for me is when towns went out, I really feel like he grew his game and filled in the blanks in a
*  bunch of different ways. I think this would be allowed easier if they had ended up being the
*  number one seed, then it'd be number three. But the two way stuff with them, I thought was,
*  that was what was in my head when I had him second team, like the defense that he's
*  been playing in some of these games when he really wants to, he can go to this level. That's
*  very few swings occupied defensively. So that was a pretty easy one. There's one guy I had in the
*  third team that I really thought long and hard about. We should mention we did, I know it's
*  positionless ballots, but I think both of us are trying to keep these picking five that at least
*  look like a basketball team. We're not going to do the thing where it's like, here are my five
*  guards that are my second team on, but I just, I still want to have the structure of center,
*  two forwards, guards, unless there's some way to, you know, and we don't want this scenario where
*  it's like Deandre Jordan on some of my third team in 2016 because he's a center. I think when you
*  start doing that, that's nuts, but for the most part, we want it to look like a basketball team.
*  Yeah, I'm not going to marry myself to anything because what if we have one year where it's just
*  absurd that there are four guards that are completely off the charts and you go, hey,
*  those are four of the five best players in the league, then maybe I'll do it. But I don't feel
*  wrong about anything so far. You know, it's a really hard task because I started by going, hey,
*  no matter what you do, it's not going to be perfect. So go into it with the minds like the first one I
*  ever did. I was like, all right, I want this to be perfect. But I stuck to it and that's where I
*  think the third team, maybe you have a little bit more and look, every voter can do whatever they
*  want. But I think the third team is maybe where it allows you to have a little bit more creativity
*  with it because I don't like over the years, some of the times we did put that third center in and
*  you're like, this guy's not even close to the other 14 guys as far as stature in the game and
*  he's going to make all of them gay. And then the guy's going to end up in the hall of fame. He's
*  like, oh, he made four all three. What is this? Third team. So LeBron James was my guy that I
*  thought about for the ant spot in the second team. No kidding. He played over 2500 minutes.
*  He was 26, seven and eight. They almost a 50, 40, 80 guy. He shot 41% from three best he's ever done.
*  He shot over five threes a game and almost six free throws a game.
*  He played 71 games. They're 41 and 30 when he played. He played 2500 plus minutes this year,
*  which was his most since 2018, another guy. And I just thought his, the ceiling of some of the games
*  that he was in where he was just kicking the ass of the other team, like he did today against New
*  Orleans. I was like, how is he not second team OMBA? And I don't know if it's the right choice.
*  I kept going back to that December, January stretch though, where I just felt like from a
*  leadership standpoint with the stature that he holds, having some of those guys dangling around
*  the trade rumors, I just didn't feel great about that two month stretch for them. And I think he,
*  it's something he could have squashed and he just didn't. And then as soon as the deadline passed,
*  that team fell into place, but he's still one of the 12 best players in the league. And I think him
*  versus Ann is a really tough one. I just didn't want to put two Lakers in the top 10 spots in
*  OMBA when they're not even a, a playoff team. They're a playing team. So at some point somebody's
*  got to lose. It just felt like a lot of nights that Ann had to carry it offensively for a team
*  that, you know, very well could have been the one seed where it sounds like I'm then applying the,
*  the Bill Simmons school of the seeding mattering so much, but I mean, it just depends on who you're
*  comparing each other to. So I felt fine about Ann and I mean, at one point you were like,
*  is LeBron going to make the third team? And then by the time you're done with it,
*  like he was one of the easiest picks. Like there was like four or five weeks ago, it seemed like,
*  it was like, man, I don't know if I'm going to vote for two Lakers if this team goes 42 and 40,
*  like I'm not doing it, but they turned it on. They played really well down the stretch and
*  I think he earned it. It was easy. I mean, did you think about putting them ahead of Kawhi?
*  I did. I did. You know, you look at the Quippers though, and the Quippers won 51 games.
*  You know, they had a big trade during the season. They, they, they lost their center for a while.
*  And I don't know. I was, I felt like he was so good. It kind of levitated them a little
*  up a level and I just had to give them that. But I did think about that. So the rest of the guys,
*  I'll do three more and then I'll talk, we'll talk about the last spot,
*  which I had the most trouble with to me. Paul George was a no doubt about it. I thought he was
*  especially down the stretch was awesome. He played over 2,500 minutes this year, which was his most
*  since 2019. Another guy, I don't know if this game limit, uh, shifted it for people. He was plus
*  9.1 net. He was almost a 50, 40, 90 guy. And I test wise, I thought the way he was peeking down
*  the stretch, I thought it was some of the best basketball I've ever seen him play. Uh, not to
*  mention the two way stuff. So I had him, I had Jalen Brown for all the reasons we mentioned earlier.
*  And then, uh, I had to put Stefan because I thought what he dealt with this season,
*  all the Dramon drama, which now it seemed like it just never ended. Chris Paul missed half the
*  season. Um, Wiggins disappeared twice. The West was brutal. He still was able to get to his 26,
*  four and five every game. He had 357 threes. He played 74 games. There were 43 and 31 when he
*  played. And he's just clearly one of the best 15 players in the league still. So those were four
*  of my five. Did you not have any of those guys? No, four for four, man. This is ridiculous. Uh,
*  the step thing, by the way, we should mention, we didn't compare notes at all.
*  Well, we did touch on it last week. We already knew. I think we had both the same. Oh yeah. But
*  I'm saying for the final edit. Yeah. Well, we hadn't talked prior to that. Uh, Stefan was easy
*  for me. The team was still good enough despite being the plan, but I go, okay, is he one of the
*  10 best players in the league and he played 74 games? Let's not make this complicated.
*  No problem. Booker I think ended up what sixth and scoring this year. So you have Booker because I
*  haven't talked about my fifth spot yet. Oh, I thought you said, I think maybe I was just
*  remembering from last week. I thought you had Booker in there. Okay. So I put Booker, LeBron,
*  Paul George in there and I'm going to do some more digging for the 15th and final spot. So I
*  had Jalen. So you don't necessarily have Jalen. What's the case against Jalen in your opinion?
*  Your argument because it's the best because it's the best team by far that they deserve
*  the second player. I'm like, I don't know. I don't know that I would do that. I mean,
*  I'm giving you a hard time a little bit here. Uh, I wrote down Zion and then cross it out. I
*  promise I didn't do it after just today's game. That's not the exercise. There's some Halliburton
*  guilt there where I think if it's close and a contract extension is on the line, like I'd be
*  more likely to vote for that player. So I'm having a really hard time with the 15th spot because I
*  like, well, cause I've told myself in the past, like, Hey, if it's somebody with the contract
*  thing on the line and it's like really close, like, I don't even like talking about this,
*  but I'm just trying to be transparent. Like I probably should feel the need to vote. And I
*  mean, I know this is why Zach Lowe is like, I don't want to do this anymore because of this
*  specific reason. And I know people hate the media even does this, but there's a real argument that
*  like Halliburton hasn't been the same guy for a long time. So am I going to feel guilty leaving
*  them off of this knowing that he's eligible for this extension? It sucks. It's the worst part of
*  this. So I had for my last spot between Booker, Sabonis, Halliburton and Wemby.
*  How about post all-star break is 18 and nine. Um, eye test doesn't look the same. And I don't feel
*  like he's jumped off the TV in the same way. And I kept coming back to that. His first 10 weeks were
*  awesome and he was in the running for first time on BA. And since then he hasn't looked the same
*  and you can give him credit for the style of that team. It's a little like what we talked about with
*  Jokic. Like that team is go, go, go, go, go. And he's, he's put that imprint on it. He's also,
*  I think the worst defensive player of anyone we've talked about so far, which I think matters. And,
*  you know, it just feels like his season kind of peaked in December range. So that was the case
*  against it. I think it's hard. I think one of the problems here is we probably have 20 guys for 15
*  spots, which is unusual. Booker who, I think it's like five, six guys for one spot. That's what I
*  mean. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. 25 guys for 15 or 22 guys for 15 spots, whatever it is. Booker,
*  the sons were 42 and 25 when he played, he played almost 24, 150 minutes of share, which is most
*  since 2020 27 points, five rebounds, seven assists. He was a 49, 36, 89 guy. And I thought about
*  leaving them off because I just didn't like putting two sons in seemed crazy to me, but then watching
*  the Minnesota game today, it's like, he's one of the best 15 players in the league. And that was
*  where it landed. Right. It's like top 15 is low for Booker. Yeah. But the one through 10 is really,
*  really hard. I mean, Ant's not going to, is Ant going to get one MVP vote this year? Like he probably
*  will from somebody along the way. He'll get like a foot place from a couple of people, I think.
*  He probably will because that's just kind of the way it works. But I had no problem. Like I went
*  into it probably thinking I was like, oh, okay, how am I going to do the final guard pairing?
*  And then once I was done with it, like, I don't mind defaulting to, hey, this guy played a full
*  season. The team was good enough. He put up huge numbers. Like we said, he was six in scoring. And
*  I think he's one of the 15 best players in the league. So I'm going to do it.
*  Yeah. One thing I was thinking about, especially with Curry, you know, when, once you hit a certain
*  level of stature as a player, LeBron obviously is the best example of this. Like you shouldn't lose
*  your spot if you had a typically really good season. Like there should be some sort of,
*  like somebody's got, it's almost like the, uh, like a UFC when it's a five rounder. And it's like,
*  you get to kind of take the title. And I don't know if anyone took the Booker spot. I think
*  Hal Burton was damn close, but I don't feel like he really took it. So bonus, there's great cases,
*  right? He played 2,900 minutes. Most of anyone in the league, he averaged 19, 14 and eight.
*  He's a really, really skilled offensive player, not as good defensively, but you know, they're
*  plus 0.4 net when he, when he's out there. Um, I don't think he passes the, does he jump off the
*  TV test? I don't think any of us feel like he's one of the 20 best guys in the league.
*  And I just wasn't going to put him on all NBA because we needed a center. Like I'd rather just
*  play LeBron as center on my fake team. I gotta be honest. When Benyama gave me more trouble than
*  Hal Burton, like I really went down the process with it thinking like since the all-star break,
*  he's 24, 12 and five with almost five blocks a game watching some of the games like that Denver
*  game the other night, his per 36 would be 26 and 13. Um, his numbers with like his, as 2010 guys
*  with blocks and steals combined stocks, 4.8 and above it's Robinson, Hakeem, Kareem and Ewing,
*  like at any point of their careers. And he was just so impactful down the stretch to me, it's
*  like the reverse of the Hal Burton argument. However, it was so impactful the first 10 weeks
*  of the season and Wemby was so impactful the last 10 weeks. It almost cancels the arguments out
*  cause you can't make the Hal Burton case, but then not make the Wemby case. Now Wemby's team sucked,
*  but Wemby that he didn't perform like it was a lottery team. Like he really gave a shit in
*  these games. Wasn't like fake stats. It was real shit. So anyway, I left them off, but I want to
*  mention it. I can't believe that you're the one arguing for women, Yama on all NBA when
*  we argued quite a bit about the Rudy Wemby thing for defensive player of the year, but
*  it's all kind of a moving target here. So bonus, I'll admit, I always feel guilty about because I'm
*  like, Oh, what do you have against tonight? Oh, 28, 14 and 11. You just go, yeah, I don't know.
*  I don't know. Like it just feels like he gets hosed despite putting up these numbers
*  that are incredible. Um, because I also think that there's a limitation on this team because of him,
*  like as skilled as he is and as great as the numbers are all the time. I'm like, do I really
*  think he's one of the 15 best players in the league? And I don't. And the Halliburton off of
*  the Wemby point, like I didn't even think about women, Yama for this. I feel stronger about a
*  different category, but for Halliburton after the all star break 43 before it, 25 after it, he went
*  from 40% from three to 31. The assist dropped off a couple. The scoring dropped off by like five
*  points. Like if you look at who he is post all star 29 games at 19, 10 and terrible three point
*  shooting, you're like, no, I can't really going to put that guy. And I, I'd say same thing, right?
*  It wasn't, he wasn't a jump out of the TV guy after the, what are you going to do? I'm, I'm putting
*  Booker. So my third team is Paul George, Jaylen, Steph Curry, Lebron James and Devin Booker. And
*  I think that's a good snapshot of the season. And so bonus Halliburton and Wemby, Yama were the
*  biggest, uh, the toughest ones for me and Zion I think has to be mentioned. I never was seriously
*  thinking about putting him there, but you know, Zion played the most minutes he's ever played and,
*  uh, really came on second half of the year to the point that he felt like a force. But then you
*  watch a game like tonight and Lebron kicked his ass, you know, he's not, he's not ready to be a top 15
*  guy yet, but there's flashes. Um, yeah, but I mean, I can't, I can't put too much into that.
*  No, I'm just saying like, I don't, I don't think he's there as a top 15 guy is my point. I think he
*  showed a lot of flashes. If you wanted to get on his case a little bit, even if you go
*  with the pre all-star post all-star splits, cause there's so many more games before the all-star
*  game. Yeah. You know, I wish, I wish they would just do like a 41 game split or something. And
*  that's how they would bring up the splits instead of this all-star stuff. Um, but it's the way that
*  it's sorted so many times on different websites, like even when he was out of shape and he was
*  still getting stats. Right. So there were games. I remember one game that was outside of the in-season
*  tournament. I was like, Oh my God, he looked terrible. Like what is he doing? And then I think
*  the next night I forget, maybe it was the golden state game they lost in January or something. And
*  I was like, Oh man, he doesn't look good. And then he went for 30 back to back the next two games.
*  And I was watching it. I think going, Oh, I still don't know that he looks good. He just looks
*  better now. He just looks so much better. And I think this week was terrific up until today's
*  afternoon game. I feel bad about the Halberd thing.
