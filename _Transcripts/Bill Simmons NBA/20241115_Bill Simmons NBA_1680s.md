# The Dangerous Cavs, Knicks Struggles and More NBA Takeaways with Big Wos | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [November 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM)
*  All right, Big Waz is here. We're taping this 1230 Thursday afternoon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=0.0s)]
*  Last time I saw you, we were doing the league pass rankings. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=4.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  And trying to figure out who we like the most, who we were the most excited to watch. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=7.36s)]
*  What's changed for you since the season has started? Has there been a team jump out? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=13.76s)]
*  Has there been somebody that captured your fancy? Has there been a new league pass mistress [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=17.84s)]
*  for you that you didn't expect to be cheating on with some of the other favorites? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=22.8s)]
*  Yeah, and I owe a big apology to Justin Verrier. It's the Chicago Bulls. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=26.16s)]
*  Oh, look at you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=31.44s)]
*  They really thought the Bulls were going to be fun and Josh Kitty was going to have this new role and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=31.92s)]
*  Damar DeRozan was going to open things up, but they've been way better than I could have [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=38.4s)]
*  expected. Obviously, they beat the Knicks last night on the crazy last second foul on a three [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  point shot, but they're just so well coached. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  Kobe White's hair got fouled. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=51.92s)]
*  I know. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=54.16s)]
*  I really think that's what happened. I thought he hit his hair. I've never seen that before. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=55.76s)]
*  That is what happened. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=59.28s)]
*  I don't think he actually fouled him. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=60.16s)]
*  But you know, he airballed the shot to make it look like he got hit pretty bad. But yeah, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=61.92s)]
*  it's Kobe White, it's Zach Levine who I don't know if he's found clarity in his role on the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=66.8s)]
*  Bulls or if he's really dying to get traded because he was so unhappy this off season. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=73.44s)]
*  I just thought they lost their most consistent player in DeRozan. Zach Levine has been sulking [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=79.44s)]
*  for like a year and a half. They're bringing in Josh Kitty, ushering a kind of youth movement [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=84.56s)]
*  kind of thing. I just thought they would stink and it's been the opposite. And Vucic has been [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  playing some of the best ball of his career. He's taking and making threes. The guy looks [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=96.16s)]
*  rejuvenated. They've been, to me, the team that has kind of jumped off the screen like, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=100.32s)]
*  wow, I thought you guys were going to be horrible and you're way better. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=105.28s)]
*  They're five and seven, which sounds like it's bad, but that's the sixth seed right now. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=109.44s)]
*  I'm with you. I was thinking about it last night, watched that Knicks game. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=115.44s)]
*  Everything they seem like they wanted to do on paper, including like pick up the pace, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=118.64s)]
*  play with some pizzazz. It's all happening. I think they're a really, really frisky five and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=125.12s)]
*  seven team. And Levine, like, I know, yeah, I get it. He was upset about whatever he's got. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=131.44s)]
*  I don't know what he's upset about. He's certainly got an amazing contract, but you watched him last [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=137.2s)]
*  night against the Knicks and my thought was this is actually a great situation for him. He's got [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=142.8s)]
*  guards that push the ball that are pretty, Kitty's pretty unselfish, right? Kobe White, I don't think [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=147.76s)]
*  is like a Trey Young monopolized the ball type guy. And it just seems like Levine's in a nice spot. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=152.88s)]
*  And what stuck out to me yesterday, they win the game on that weird Kobe, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=158.4s)]
*  Kobe White foul, get the Brunson toilet bowl in and out to win it. But you watched the way their [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=162.64s)]
*  bench was celebrating. It actually seems like they liked each other. Last year did not. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=168.64s)]
*  No, it was, man, last year was toxic as hell by all indication when you talk to people [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=172.4s)]
*  who was in and around the team at that time. And I think with Vucic and Patrick Williams, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  I'm still like, whoa, what were they thinking with that contract? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=184.24s)]
*  Yeah, he's like one of those. What do you do? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=187.68s)]
*  I don't know if it's the three or the D. What's your specialty? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=191.84s)]
*  I don't know. I'm still trying to figure it out. But he's been a more willing shooter. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=194.56s)]
*  Yeah. And like with Vucic finally being a stretch four, Levine is playing with like a really [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=200.16000000000003s)]
*  spaced out floor in front of him. And the guy is really talented. Like he's not a, well, this year [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  he's not been afraid to take it to the basket. And there were just some isolation plays last night [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=213.12s)]
*  in the fourth quarter where it just felt like the Knicks had no chance against Zach Levine, which [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=218.8s)]
*  like, when's the last time you said that about Zach Levine? He looks incredible. And then, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=222.96s)]
*  you know, the Knicks. Wait, hold on on Zach Levine, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=229.12s)]
*  because I want to talk about the Knicks. I was thinking about him, Brandon Ingram. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=232.32s)]
*  Yeah. I think Trey Young's about to be in this boat. These guys that got these big deals. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  Julius Randall, these guys that are being paid like they're superstars, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=241.04s)]
*  they do put up production and yet there's not a market for them. And it's because of the second [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=245.67999999999998s)]
*  apron. Kurt Goldsberger was talking about them in my pod on Tuesday. It's just, it's changed the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  dynamic of roster building of how we think about players. We take somebody like Brandon Ingram, who [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=256.08s)]
*  was available all summer for anybody who wanted to offer anything and they couldn't trade him. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=261.76s)]
*  Now he's scoring 23, 24 a game. Zach Levine, same thing. And we're moving into this new era [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  of these guys that it's like, well, this is my price. I don't want to pay that. I'm stuck with you. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=272.32s)]
*  But you're still producing. Yeah. I don't remember another era like this. The only [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=280.4s)]
*  time I could think was that 2000s when guys were getting those six, seven year deals. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=284.24s)]
*  And you would just be like, oh, I guess we have Allen Houston now for the entire decade. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. I think that's the difference between now and 2011 or 12, which is like when I first became [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=293.44s)]
*  a regular on league pass, it was like whoever the bulls were, when they decided that they were going [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  to stink up the joint, they were going to have basically three rotation worthy guys in the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=307.44s)]
*  starting lineup. And everybody else was kind of going to be like, okay, this team is headed for [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=314.08000000000004s)]
*  17 wins. They're playing the lottery game and whatever. Nowadays, like the Bulls we expected to [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=318.48s)]
*  be a bottom four Eastern Conference team, but because they haven't gotten rid of, like they [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  would have sold off Vujicic, they would have sold off Levine, they would have sold everything off. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=330.48s)]
*  But now because they kept those guys, like they're just not a given win. There's no like given wins. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=334.88s)]
*  And then even the Wizards on some nights of first game, I think. Brooklyn's another one. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  Brooklyn's another one. Yeah. Toronto. There's no process Sixers is what I always say. Like that [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=346.8s)]
*  process Sixers team where Michael Carter Williams was leading that team in scoring for an entire [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=353.04s)]
*  season. That was insane. And we were like, he's not good. And he was like one of the rookie of the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=359.2s)]
*  year. It's like, well, he's 20 points a game. Exactly. You know, this is a really interesting [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=365.2s)]
*  point. Can you have tanking when there's too much talent in the league? Because I think about that [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=369.44s)]
*  with Brooklyn. I watched Brooklyn. I saw them in person on Friday. I talked about it in the pod. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=374.08s)]
*  Watched him yesterday. The Celtics played really well and beat them and they played one of their [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=378.4s)]
*  best games. But I watched Brooklyn. I'm like, I know they wanted to be terrible. It's going to be [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=381.84s)]
*  really hard to be terrible with some of the guys in this team. Like Schroeder is a above average [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=387.12s)]
*  point guard. Cam Johnson's good. Cam Thomas is a 20 80 game guy now. They have shop walking. This [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=393.2s)]
*  is not like in 2013 14 when you can just be like, yeah, we're going to throw a year away. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=399.52s)]
*  Like think about what the Lakers had during the last couple of Kobe years where it was like, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=404.08s)]
*  here's Kobe and nobody else. Yeah, it's so different. And I don't know if it's just the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=409.44s)]
*  talent. Like these dudes have just come out and played with a lot of pride. Like just quite [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=416.56s)]
*  frankly. Do you think it's social media? Like I wonder if it's just hard to suck now because [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=420.79999999999995s)]
*  if you suck with the fantasy and the and the gambling gambling aspect that that might play [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=424.96s)]
*  a part man. I feel like it's social media because I was thinking about this. Vince Carter got his [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=430.96s)]
*  number retired in Toronto and I was just thinking how crazy that is. Yeah. That he started. I was [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=435.76s)]
*  writing for US pin back then and he completely tanked on them that year to the point that I was [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=441.2s)]
*  reading those columns. Yeah. He typed it in the point that the trade that they made for him is [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=445.44s)]
*  probably the worst superstar trade anyone's made. They had to like take back Alonzo [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=450.71999999999997s)]
*  Morning's contract and a couple other bad contracts. They got two shitty picks. It was [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=454.56s)]
*  like a 20 cents in the dollar giveaway. It was because he stopped playing for them. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=459.03999999999996s)]
*  But we didn't have the apparatus we have now to be like, oh my God, did you see what Vince [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=463.44s)]
*  Carter did last night? Like he just didn't give a shit. I don't feel like anybody can do that now. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=467.76s)]
*  Yeah. But I mean, it's really hard to explain why none of these teams have come out and been, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=472.56s)]
*  you know, just dog shit. And again, it's early, like nobody's had. I guess the dog [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=479.28s)]
*  shit team has probably been Philly. Yeah. Sorry, Chris Ryan, but yeah, but there's a reason for it. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=485.67999999999995s)]
*  No, there's a reason for it, but they still stink. Yeah. They've been, they've been God awful. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=494.64s)]
*  Well, think about the other day, JJ D'Angelo Russell had that point in the corner and whatever [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=498.79999999999995s)]
*  he did, he got his three pointer blocked. He did some stupid step back and the camera showed JJ [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=505.68s)]
*  so fucking mad and he sat down and he's like, just like sat in his thing and he was like, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=511.12s)]
*  like a parent mad at a kid and even that. So now he's like, well, that'll never happen again. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=516.72s)]
*  Cause he just saw the video of it. It became a big deal. The next day he's like, I can't do that [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=521.6800000000001s)]
*  anymore. I just think there's a lot of checks and balances now for bad basketball, lazy basketball, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=525.28s)]
*  lethargic basketball. People don't give a shit. People go in through the motions. I don't know [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=531.44s)]
*  if you can do it anymore. And I think what's crazy too is that like the NBA because of how [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=535.44s)]
*  they handled some of this load management stuff have been, how did they handle it poorly? They've [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=541.0400000000001s)]
*  been so effective in messaging that the regular season doesn't matter. This isn't real basketball [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=548.4000000000001s)]
*  playoffs where things really start and people are playing hard. That's not been the case to start [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=553.84s)]
*  the season. Like every single one of these games feels like super competitive. People are playing [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=559.36s)]
*  like the people aren't playing with super low voters. There's some teams that are like, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=565.12s)]
*  seem to have a bit of a hangover. I think Denver started the first four games of the season [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=569.6s)]
*  with a bit of a hangover. Minnesota's hangover has been extended. Minnesota's not just hungover. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=573.6s)]
*  They're like lying in bed with the shades dry. They still can't drive. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=579.2s)]
*  Man. They're way over the league still. Yeah. 100%. But for the most part, man, teams have come out [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=585.44s)]
*  and been playing out the gates. Like OKC feels like they got something to prove. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=591.84s)]
*  Cleveland. I got something to prove. Cleveland. I mean, my God, they've come out like gangbusters [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=596.32s)]
*  and it's made the regular season excellent for it. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=602.0s)]
*  I'm going to read you some of the 2013-14 Sixers. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=606.4s)]
*  Leading scorer, Evan Turner. Wow. Michael Carter Williams, your rookie of the year, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=612.08s)]
*  shooting 264 from three and 40% from the field. Thad Young was our number three. Spencer Hawes. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=618.16s)]
*  Number five, James Anderson playing 29 minutes a game, 80 games. Who was James Anderson? I don't [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=627.1999999999999s)]
*  know. I was on a studio show that year and I don't remember who James Anderson was. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=634.8s)]
*  James Anderson. He went to first round pick from the, I remember him. OK. Henry Sims. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=639.4399999999999s)]
*  Tony Rotten. Yeah. Tony Rotten. That was a Tony Rotten [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=647.76s)]
*  apologist in those days. Hollis Thompson. Lavoie Allen was their ninth man. This is our point. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=652.0s)]
*  You look at the ninth man now in the Nets. The game I went to Friday, like [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=658.64s)]
*  Jalen Wilson's coming. I'm like, this guy's good. Yeah. Should he play more? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=663.1999999999999s)]
*  That Sixers team would challenge the Bobcats in terms of worst win. No question. In terms of [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=667.36s)]
*  worst win loss record ever. And teams just aren't that horrible. And some of it, like you said, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=674.96s)]
*  is the second apron where, you know, contenders, I think in a different era, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=681.6800000000001s)]
*  Golden State would have looked at, they would have said, you know what, instead of doing the [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=686.8000000000001s)]
*  Melton and Buddy Heal to replace Clay, we're going to pull the trigger on Zach Levine in a different [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=691.52s)]
*  era. But now with like all of the Salome constraints. The Lakers would already probably have them. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=696.96s)]
*  100%. And you know, maybe they're keeping the powder dry for Trey Young. Who knows? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=701.76s)]
*  But yeah, it's just a different era, man. 2014 Bucks who were 15 and 67. Brandon Knight led the [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=707.2s)]
*  team in scoring. Ramon Sessions was second. Remember him? A young Chris Middleton third. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=714.8s)]
*  Ilya Sova, John Henson, OJ Mayo, Larry Sanders, Hey Now playing 20 games. But man, and then Young [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=722.3199999999999s)]
*  Giannis was just that. That was great for Young Giannis. Larry Sanders is pissed right now. KD [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=729.76s)]
*  like smokes weed openly. Yeah, Larry Sanders is like, I tried this. Why didn't it work for me? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=735.04s)]
*  They kicked me out the league for this. Yeah. So if you think about the actual bad teams, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=740.24s)]
*  Toronto is probably like fundamentally the worst team, but then Scotty Barnes can come back and [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=746.3199999999999s)]
*  who knows? And they're competitive on a lot of teams. They can rebound. They can shoot threes. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=751.28s)]
*  The other thing is we didn't talk about the threes. Like this is the first season. The threes are 40% [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=756.8s)]
*  of the shots that everyone takes. That's just the variance that comes from that. You just never know. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=762.16s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. The threes is always, it's been a sort of, you know, less talented teams. You want to up [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=767.52s)]
*  your variance factor with the threes. Everybody's kind of known this for like seven, eight years now. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=775.1999999999999s)]
*  But like, but the discipline with which coaches are actually able to enforce it. Yeah. Is different [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=780.08s)]
*  now. It's just better infrastructure to make sure. Like, is this one thing to say, like, we're going [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=788.64s)]
*  to play with pace. We're going to, you know what I mean? We're going to shoot the three point shot. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=793.36s)]
*  We're going to encourage as many threes as we can, but to like actually coach it and get your guys [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=797.5200000000001s)]
*  to be doing a consistency to go against their instinct to dribble, dribble, dribble, shoot along [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=802.32s)]
*  two is different. You were going to mention the Knicks. What about them? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=807.12s)]
*  I miss last year's Knicks. I miss Hartenstein. I miss Dante. Yeah. They were just more fun to watch [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=815.44s)]
*  last year and I know they'll figure it out. Yeah. The Towns has been incredible. Yeah. Ronson's not [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=824.72s)]
*  been as good. Yep. There are five at the end of games, which it seems like it's a little better [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=829.28s)]
*  offensively, but it's definitely worse defensively. Yeah. The rim protection isn't there in the same [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=835.76s)]
*  way. And there's a bunch of it now that we have a sample size, some of the advanced stats are like, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=841.12s)]
*  huh, this isn't really the profile of a tips team. No. So what are you seeing? Yeah. I mean, yeah. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=845.4399999999999s)]
*  The Carl Towns rim protection, we knew that was going to be a problem coming into the season. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=852.56s)]
*  And we just talked about this on group chat with Rob and Justin. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=857.92s)]
*  But Cale Bridges is getting smoked on defense. He's just not been a deterrent at all. And again, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=862.0799999999999s)]
*  OGN and Opie. You can't mention this to the Knicks fans. Well, listen. I mentioned last week, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=869.04s)]
*  I was like, what was the point of trading five first for this guy if he's going to shoot 13 [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=874.56s)]
*  times a game? But the other side has been interesting too. I think the scoring is going to [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=878.56s)]
*  come. I think that he's going to learn what spots to pick, when to attack, when to just let it fire. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=883.28s)]
*  Didn't you think they gave them the ball more and just have run through more stuff on them? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=890.5600000000001s)]
*  I guess the Towns Brunson pick and roll is so good. They can't afford to because their defense is so [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=894.16s)]
*  bad. Like if you're getting cooked, you kind of have to look at your best player and say, yo, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=899.44s)]
*  we need points right now. If they were stopping people, then they would be a lot more patient [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=904.88s)]
*  about who gets to do what on offense. But when like you're constantly having to put out fires [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=910.64s)]
*  because you just gave up, you know, 10 points in a row. Like at a certain point it is, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=916.64s)]
*  you got to give it to Brunson. What I'm encouraged by is that the Towns and Brunson pick and roll is [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=921.68s)]
*  clearly difficult to deal with. It's a nightmare. They're putting defenses in a bind because [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=927.12s)]
*  Brunson, unlike a lot of these star point guards can be the center on a switch. Like Halliburton's [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=931.84s)]
*  been having trouble with it this year. Brunson, as soon as you put a big man on him, he's killing [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=938.3199999999999s)]
*  that guy. And if you, God forbid, you drop on freaking Carl Towns, like that's a nightmare. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=942.96s)]
*  And so I like that that's already started to figure itself out. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=948.64s)]
*  Jamie Tworkowski Can we say one thing about Towns? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=952.08s)]
*  Brunson Sure. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=954.08s)]
*  Jamie Tworkowski He's been kind of a winner of the season [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=954.5600000000001s)]
*  because he's been, I think, better offensively than anybody could have ever expected on the Knicks. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=958.48s)]
*  And then Minnesota feels worse. Brunson [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=964.8000000000001s)]
*  Minnesota is definitely worse. Jamie Tworkowski [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=966.96s)]
*  Oh, we missed Towns. Like I feel like this has been a win all the way around for Towns. And then [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=968.32s)]
*  instead of the Knicks fans being mad at Towns for whatever, they can just now be mad at Bridges. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=973.0400000000001s)]
*  Brunson Yes. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=977.52s)]
*  Jamie Tworkowski So he wins in every way. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=978.08s)]
*  Brunson Look, I think the Bridges thing is everybody's [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=981.2800000000001s)]
*  in a patient wait and see moment. It's been 11 games. I'm not crazy worried about it. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=984.32s)]
*  Jamie Tworkowski I do wonder if you stop playing defense for like, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=989.12s)]
*  you're just on bad teams for two years. Like I wonder if it almost you have to get back in the [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=992.24s)]
*  hang of what it's like to be on a really good team playing defense. Brunson [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=996.32s)]
*  It's not just that though. It's like when guys start conceiving themselves as 20 point per game [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=998.88s)]
*  scores and all of a sudden it's like, no, you're back to being that role guy that you were in [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1005.52s)]
*  Phoenix. And it's like, no, I was a ball in Brooklyn. I was like a way back. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1012.96s)]
*  Jamie Tworkowski Can I show you a YouTube clip of my game [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1017.36s)]
*  winners? Brunson [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1019.52s)]
*  No, he got to get back to what he was doing in Phoenix for sure. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1019.92s)]
*  Jamie Tworkowski If you truth serum them, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1022.48s)]
*  I wonder what they would say about the whole Yanis piece of this. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1028.24s)]
*  Brunson I know you saw the graphic last night where they showed all of the picks that the nigg [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1031.44s)]
*  sent out to bring Bridges in. Jamie Tworkowski [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1037.44s)]
*  A couple of them were good picks. We didn't know that whatever that Bucks pick, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1039.04s)]
*  which is so complicated where New Orleans gets it if it's one through four, now Brooklyn gets it if [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1044.88s)]
*  it's everything else. But I think the Bucks are a 500 or worse team. If anything happens to Yanis [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1049.2s)]
*  for a month, that team's going to be a bottom five team in the league. They're pulling these [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1055.6000000000001s)]
*  games out of their assholes. Brunson [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1060.24s)]
*  Well, it's like they've won three games. Jamie Tworkowski [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1062.0s)]
*  Well, but the one yesterday, the guy gets fouled with the second left. He just has to go one and [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1063.8400000000001s)]
*  two and the game's over and he bricks both of them. And then Yanis wins an OT. Yeah, I just [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1069.52s)]
*  like what they're doing. The next thing, if we're going to be rational about it, the Towns thing [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1076.0s)]
*  has been a huge win. All the other stuff is explainable. Robinson is going to come back. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1081.36s)]
*  There's probably some sort of buyout guy they can get in February to replace some of the [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1086.56s)]
*  DiFincenzo because it feels like there's a lot on McBride. And then the Brunson, I know he hasn't [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1089.92s)]
*  been quite as good and efficient as last year, but I also feel like teams have been watching this now [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1095.36s)]
*  for a couple of years. It's like Jalen Hurts on the Eagles where it's like, oh, I know what this is. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1100.6399999999999s)]
*  How to play a new way. Like this is a completely reconstructed offense like that. He hasn't been [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1104.08s)]
*  completely comfortable yet. I don't think it's the biggest deal. I just think it's scary that like [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1109.04s)]
*  missing Mitchell Robinson and Precious Achua is this damaging to your team. Like that's a bad [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1114.96s)]
*  sign so far. But again, I think it's pretty early. And right now the 20th in defensive efficiency. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1122.8s)]
*  Just stunning. Get that down to 13. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1128.32s)]
*  But that's the bigger question for me is, is this the right TIBS team? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1130.88s)]
*  Is this a TIBS team the way it's currently constructed? Or is this a maybe somebody else [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1136.4s)]
*  with a car keys? I mean, I think if TIBS is worth what he thinks he is, then he needs to also adjust. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1141.3600000000001s)]
*  Players have to adjust. Coaches should adjust. Can I do a PSA for the other 29 teams? When the Knicks [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1146.8000000000002s)]
*  have the ball with like three seconds or less and they need to score, they're going to throw it to [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1153.1200000000001s)]
*  Jalen Brunson in the corner. He's going to pretend to go left and then he's going to do a [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1159.6s)]
*  follow-away jump shot. I'm just telling you that's what's going to happen. You can pretend to bite on [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1163.6s)]
*  the going left, but then dive forward when he's doing the turnaround. That's his move. It works [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1169.52s)]
*  every time. Do these guys have tape? It's tough in the moment, Bill. It's like Tatum. Here's [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1174.8799999999999s)]
*  what Tatum's going to do. He's going to dribble through his legs seven times and then when there's [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1182.24s)]
*  two seconds left, he's going to do a step back 26 footer. We know all these moves. LeBron, he has [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1185.84s)]
*  a specific spot on the court. He's going to shoot a three from there. He's going to make you think [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1191.12s)]
*  he's going to the basket. The acro and step back. There's some guys that you just know what they're [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1195.04s)]
*  going to do and then there's other guys like Durant where I'm like, I have no idea what he's [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1199.9199999999998s)]
*  going to do. He's going to go right. He's going to pull up. He's going to do the turnaround move. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1202.9599999999998s)]
*  Brunson's, yeah, he's going to try to create space with a little shoulder face. He's got to be so hard [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1206.48s)]
*  to guard because I think they know what he's doing and he still get, he's got a little [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1211.36s)]
*  Luca in him in terms of the stop and start. He's not the fastest, but he can get accelerated [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1216.9599999999998s)]
*  faster than everybody else and decelerate faster than everybody else. Yeah, it's not easy from the [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1223.6799999999998s)]
*  couch, Bill. That's what they would tell you. Well, you know what I think the secret hardest [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1229.4399999999998s)]
*  move is the Luca two on one when he slows down and then almost makes it like a low post move. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1233.4399999999998s)]
*  Where he's got momentum, but he stops and the guy's like also playing the pass and then Luca just [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1241.52s)]
*  like, I'm just going to bounce off you in a bank. Four times against the Warriors the other night. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1245.84s)]
*  I don't even know what that move is, but I feel like he's perfected it. And I'm like, that's [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1249.28s)]
*  Trey Mon Green, one of the best defensive players in my life and he can't even stop it. It is weird. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1253.36s)]
*  Are you scared of the Cavs? The Cavs, man, listen, I know like every single smart NBA person, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1259.4399999999998s)]
*  you guys included on the over unders had the Cavs over Kenny Atkinson winning coach of the year. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1268.32s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, they're going to play better. They're going to be way healthier this year. But [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1275.2s)]
*  I don't know. They kind of took off last year when they guys weren't playing. But Kenny Atkinson has [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1278.72s)]
*  been smart about deploying the lineups, letting Mowgli play center at times, being the lone big. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1283.9199999999998s)]
*  He's gotten these guys to understand the importance of spacing and they're like Niang, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1290.8799999999999s)]
*  for instance, this guy is completely unconscious. Like he shoots with the green light of a fucking [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1297.76s)]
*  Kevin Durant at certain points. And Donovan Mitchell, God bless him. He's getting off of [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1303.2s)]
*  the ball a lot faster than he has at any other time in his career. That's always been my biggest [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1308.64s)]
*  criticism of him is that he doesn't see the floor as well as a lot of the guys that I think are a [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1313.36s)]
*  little bit better than him. But this year he's seeing it. They're believing in. I think there's [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1318.08s)]
*  something to everybody feeling like they have ownership of the offense, which Atkinson, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1322.4s)]
*  he spent some time in Golden State with Steve Kerr. We make fun of Steve Kerr a lot of times [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1328.16s)]
*  with his hippie dippy, like the ball finds energy shit. But Atkinson has brought it. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1331.92s)]
*  Hippie dippy. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1336.88s)]
*  That's what it feels like to me. It feels like he's on a commune when he's saying some of that [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1337.68s)]
*  stuff. But Atkinson has brought that ethos to Cleveland and they've been way better for it. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1341.8400000000001s)]
*  And he brought Ty Jerome because he knew Ty Jerome was good from like two years ago. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1347.3600000000001s)]
*  Revelation. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1351.2s)]
*  It's like when football, when the guy like when the guy Dan Quinn went from Dallas to [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1351.92s)]
*  Washington, he took like a couple of Dallas guys with him. It's like, I know this guy's pretty [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1356.5600000000002s)]
*  good. I'll grab this guy too. I'm a hundred percent in on the Cavs being real. I don't [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1359.76s)]
*  think there's any fluky shit at all. It totally may from the first, second, third game, you can [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1364.48s)]
*  see it in there. I talked about it before, but there's, there's like a charitableness now [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1370.4s)]
*  with Mitchell and Garland. I don't think Mitchell cares if he doesn't have the ball in the last [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1377.28s)]
*  minute anymore. I felt like he did last year. I think Garland did a little bit too. I just feel [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1381.6s)]
*  like they've sorted out something and then, you know, they can defend, they can switch, they have [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1386.32s)]
*  a bench. As Celtic fan, they're on my radar because I thought we would have the one seed [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1393.52s)]
*  unless somebody got hurt. Now it's like, this seems, I think it's going to be tough to, to, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1402.1599999999999s)]
*  to steal the one seed from them. You start out 14-0, 15-0. Like just think about it logically [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1408.08s)]
*  for the rest of the way, you just have to go like 45 and, you know, 18 or whatever. It's, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1415.36s)]
*  it's not the same pace to get to 60. And the Celtics are going to have trouble getting to 60. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1422.48s)]
*  And if you look at the Eastern Conference standings right now, a lot of teams are going to have [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1427.04s)]
*  trouble getting to 50. It's crazy how these things flip because, you know, there was all the smoke [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1433.2s)]
*  around Donovan Mitchell for years that he was not going to, he was not long for Cleveland. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1442.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. He ends up doing his extension. Chams puts out that report that Garland's representation might [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1446.0s)]
*  seek a trade if Mitchell's still on the team because he feels like he's not being optimized. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1454.0800000000002s)]
*  They bring in Kenny Atkinson and shit, man. Everything sort of flips and everybody has this [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1460.16s)]
*  level of buying. It's just so crazy how things can turn on a dime in this league. Kenny calls [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1466.16s)]
*  him and he's like, I'm going to optimize your shit. And, and, hey, just, just bear with me, buddy. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1471.52s)]
*  They've bought in and they look so much better for it. And like I said before, it did feel like a [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1477.1200000000001s)]
*  your turn, my turn situation with Mitchell and Garland where I'm just like, man, these guys have [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1484.64s)]
*  complimentary games. They both can shoot, both can drive it. They should be elevating what each other [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1490.96s)]
*  do. And this year is the first time in that partnership that I actually feel like it's [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1496.5600000000002s)]
*  happening and it's been exciting to watch. I'm good at very few things. I can spot toupees. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1501.5200000000002s)]
*  I can make meatballs. That's like me with BBLs. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1510.0s)]
*  I, I could spot the your turn, my turn. I'm just attuned. I've been watching basketball my whole [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1515.44s)]
*  life. You know it when you see it. You know when it's not perfect. Look at what Tatum and Brown [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1521.2s)]
*  got rid of that dynamic where they now elevate what each other do. Where back in the days we were like, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1525.76s)]
*  oh, these guys are too duplicative. Like we might have to move on, blah, blah, blah. Now these guys [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1531.6000000000001s)]
*  actually play off of each other. That is a freaking lie. I always believed in my guys. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1536.72s)]
*  No, I think, I think you can tell the difference between your turn, my turn, competitive versus [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1545.2s)]
*  elevation. And now I feel like those guys elevate each other, which is a boring topic for a podcast [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1551.6000000000001s)]
*  or a YouTube video or an NBA content segment. But it's what's happening. That team's playing super [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1557.76s)]
*  unselfish. And then you watch a team like, you know, like Philly when Embiid comes back and how [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1562.72s)]
*  they have to navigate. How do you take care of Embiid? How do you, how does Paul George make sure [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1568.72s)]
*  he's involved up? Oh wait, there's Maxie too. Oh, there's Jared McCain, who's having the, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1573.84s)]
*  would might be the rookie of the year if he could just get playing minutes. How do you navigate all [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1578.9599999999998s)]
*  this stuff? He's got to beat out Eric Gordon. And what happens, right. And what happens with [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1582.9599999999998s)]
*  Zombie Nick Nurse? Does he ever turn back into Toronto Nick Nurse or is he just Zombie Nick Nurse [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1589.04s)]
*  now? I mean, Nick Nurse did a great job last year. I think the Sixers definitely overperformed most [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1594.32s)]
*  of our expectations. Maybe the playoffs wasn't ideal. Playoffs are pretty rough. They over [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1600.4s)]
*  perform most of our expectations. And I think what we can be bullish about is- You're in the Nick [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1605.44s)]
*  Nurse Kool-Aid drinking camp. I'm just saying last year they were good. Wasn't on my research. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1611.1200000000001s)]
*  Last year they were good. The thing is Embiid, I know a lot of people kill them for saying, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1616.72s)]
*  I don't care about MVP. It's about the playoffs. It's about winning. I like that for a team that's [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1621.52s)]
*  trying to incorporate Paul George, that has Maxey, who's ascendant. I like the idea that he's not [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1627.44s)]
*  going to feel the onus to dominate every possession like he traditionally has for the team, basically [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1632.8s)]
*  his entire career. And so that's a good sign. I think they're going to be straight. You know [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1639.6000000000001s)]
*  what I mean? When Embiid is beating dudes up in the locker room for writing bad columns. And- [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1644.48s)]
*  Well, here's the thing. Yabba Selle and McCain are guys who could play in a playoff series. So, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1649.68s)]
*  when they're operating on the fringes and trying to- You're picking out of the lottery. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1656.72s)]
*  You're trying to grab, take flyers on dudes, and usually it doesn't work out. And it seems like [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1661.28s)]
*  both of those guys, I feel like, could be in a top seven on a good team. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY9m1NYWmM&t=1666.08s)]
