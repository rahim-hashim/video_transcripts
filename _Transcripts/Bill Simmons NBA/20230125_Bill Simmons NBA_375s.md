# Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Did What LeBron James is Doing Now | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [January 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fze96de1JTo)
*  Oh, this is another thing I want to throw you guys. Um, it's a good segue actually,
*  cause this LeBron people are doing this whole, oh, LeBron, nobody's ever done this before.
*  And it's amazing what he's doing. I'm, I'm conceding that, but I was really glad that
*  Ramona Shelbourne went and interviewed Pat Riley about Kareem today. Cause guess what?
*  Kareem did this. Kareem at age 38 was fucking awesome. He was the best player in the 1985
*  finals. And I know that because I went to the games and he killed us. He destroyed us. He
*  changed the series. He was 38 years old at the time. Um, his, his 84, 85 season, he turned 38 in
*  April in the, in the finals. He was 26 and nine, 60% shooting in the finals in his 85, 86 season.
*  When he was 38 turning into 39, he averaged 23 and six 56%. More importantly house,
*  he played 98 games, including playoffs in 84, 85, and he played 90 games in 85, 86.
*  So I'm just removing LeBron. I just feel, I wrote this in my book and it's worse now. Kareem is the
*  most overlooked superstar in any sport. It's unbelievable to me. It's like he'd never happen.
*  Guy was a fucking absolute unicorn and gets no credit.
*  And think about the physical challenge in the mid eighties, right?
*  Shit kicked out of them. All the benefits now of, of, you know, hyperbaric chambers and the massage,
*  like all of the advancements in, in medical science that lead to enhanced recuperation and,
*  and recovery. He did some of that. Like he, he was doing yoga. He had like, he had like,
*  he was the first guy to kind of have a diet, but that was it. I mean, it was like, whoa,
*  Kareem's doing yoga. He also did like, he did karate versus Bruce Lee.
*  Right. But Kareem, he plays, he goes all four years in college and then he plays all the way
*  until he's 42 years old. He was kind of done the last year and a half, but age 38, age 39, age 40
*  was still like a really important NBA player. Put some respect on Kareem's name. God damn it.
*  Hey, I like, I like this. And by the way, my least favorite NBA star of all time. I hate it.
*  Yeah. He's been calling him a ninny. He's been calling Kareem a ninny for 30 years.
*  You probably hate LeBron more now. Come on. No, Kareem's still my least favorite.
*  We're doing like the rankings. Come on. Who annoys you more? At least Kareem's old now. Come on.
*  Kareem on the court annoyed me the most. LeBron, the way he just kind of jumped sides,
*  depending on what's in it for him. Like the shin and sharp thing was classic LeBron.
*  But you always- If that had been Skip Bayless yelling at Russell Westbrook, he would have
*  reacted like there was like an invasion from a foreign country. But you always jump me for the
*  zags. You love when I zag. I like this. Everybody's praising how awesome LeBron is right now at 38. Hey,
*  hold up everybody. Let's talk about a guy who did it in 1985. This ain't that great.
*  Kareem is great. It's my only point. I just don't want to hear that we've never seen this before.
*  It's like we've literally seen this before in the NBA finals in the last 40 years.
*  One of the things that's frustrating to old guys like Kaus and I is that people seem to think
*  professional sports started in like 2000. And it's just the way it's going. Like even today,
*  my guy, Steven Ruiz, who's doing a great job for the ringer, he theorized that the Brady-Manning
*  debate started like the whole QB debates that we have now. And it's like, actually we were there
*  when it started because House and I are both fucking old, but it was Marino versus Montana versus Elway
*  for what? 12 years of our life, we argued. And then it was Sanders versus Emmett. And those,
*  we would just sit in a bar and fucking argue about that for an hour. Like real legitimate
*  arguments. House, were you a Sanders guy or an Emmett guy? Well, I suffered at the hands of
*  Emmett so much more religiously and regularly. He was in the division. So yeah, I put respect
*  on Emmett's name. Verno's a Cowboys fan, so he was an Emmett guy. Were you Montana, Marino or Elway?
*  Always Montana. Montana, Montana, Montana. That's where I was too, Verno. Did you have an
*  opinion on that? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Joe Montana was the guy, because he was the guy that won.
*  That's it. He's the guy that won. He's another one. Montana and this cream comp. Montana's another
*  one who's just been shoved into outer space when he's mentioned these great debates. He was the
*  mythology when I was a kid. He was the, hey, it's John Candy in the stands. Or remember that old
*  story? And then he goes, he was the original Joe Cool. And he was the guy that was so, I mean,
*  when I was a kid, much like y'all, it was, I mean, my father got Sport Illustrated. So the guys that
*  were the cover of Sport Illustrated, those were the guys. And Montana was like, it's like Super Bowl
*  Joe. And it was always, you know, I mean, I could visualize these covers of him being on. He was
*  just, I mean, he was the guy. This is before the Brady stuff, you know? And I'm sure that you were
*  saying that too, right? When Brady was going through his, you were like, why is everybody acting
*  like this hasn't been done before? Joe Montana did it. Is that what you're saying?
*  No, we, Brady needed the 28, he needed the Falcons game because to me, I was never going to put
*  anyone over Montana. And then the Falcons game, I was like, all right, he did it. That's the
*  greatest thing I've ever seen the quarterback do on top of. He has all the other resume stuff.
*  I want Kareem, I really want Kareem to come on my podcast. I know I called him a ninny in my book
*  a hundred times, but I really respect that guy. As a basketball, it was out of love that he used
*  to kick our ass. And he also threw an elbow at Larry Bird once, which it took me a while to forgive.
