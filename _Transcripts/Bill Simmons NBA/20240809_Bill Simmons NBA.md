# Team USA Survives a Classic vs. Serbia! Can They Finish Vs. France?  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [August 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZEFIpyqJIs)
*  Initially, I thought this was going to be me and my buddy house.
*  We were just going to talk about the USA blowout win over Serbia and then bring
*  in the Bundle to talk football.
*  And then all of a sudden it became a game.
*  We had to bring in Mahoney.
*  Wow.
*  He's here as well.
*  I don't know where to start, but it really felt like they were going to lose
*  this game at one point and the team USA has these every four years that happened
*  in Oh, wait against Spain.
*  It happened in 12 against Spain.
*  It happened in 16, I think in the semifinals.
*  But you always know there's one of these coming.
*  I thought it was going to be France in France, Saturday with the crowd and all
*  that stuff, but yoga Jim Bogdanovic had other ideas.
*  Mahoney, where do you want to start?
*  Do you want to go in beads?
*  Maybe greatest moment in his basketball career.
*  Do you want to go the Steph Curry moment that we talked about literally two days
*  ago, like, whoa, we know it's in there, but will we see it?
*  Or do you want to talk LeBron big boy game?
*  Um, just putting on the biceps and the chest and just ripping through Serbia.
*  You pick what topic.
*  I think we might be able to merge the latter two, right?
*  The, the lions of team USA have fully arrived.
*  We got the Steph game.
*  We've been waiting for, as you said, Jesus Christ.
*  Did team USA need it?
*  Honestly, for as much as we've been talking about, you know, the Oh, wait
*  team or the 92 team, all these like cross the limit comparisons or team USA.
*  A lot of this game felt a lot like Oh four where USA was getting destroyed,
*  trying to guard, pick and roll completely flummoxed by a zone and
*  settling for a lot of stuff.
*  Giving like just awful, awful execution in ways that feel very familiar for
*  underperforming American teams past.
*  And some weird coaching too, it just a lot of lineups and a lot of subs.
*  And it was like, he never stuck with five guys for more than like,
*  it felt like 90 seconds.
*  Yeah.
*  But the one through line was Steph was on fire and was the only reason they even
*  had a chance to come back in this game at all.
*  House, what's your big takeaway from that?
*  Are you feeling patriotic?
*  Were you thinking about your France 15 to one bet at any point and thinking
*  about rooting for Yoke-age were you waiting for somebody to step up on team
*  USA and then it happened?
*  What, what walked me through your second half?
*  Well, in the first place, I'm exhausted.
*  I need a, not just one cigarette, but two, because I'm all fucked out from that
*  one that they put me through the ringer.
*  Um, I will say from a narrative standpoint, how, how beautiful that you
*  get Steph and LeBron and KD, right?
*  KD came out, looked like a clunker, but started making the biggest of big
*  buckets, um, in the second half.
*  And this team, we all knew you guys talked about it was susceptible to somebody
*  coming in and raining threes on them.
*  And the challenge is that communication out on the perimeter.
*  They just switched terribly for three quarters of the game.
*  Now the boys from Serbia, um, were light in the basket on fire.
*  They finished under 40% from three because they didn't make any in the fourth quarter.
*  And they didn't make any in the fourth quarter because when it's winning time
*  and you're on the biggest stage, everybody, you know, gets a little bit, the tiniest bit.
*  Cause a couple of those looks were wide open for the Serbians.
*  Right?
*  I'm so glad you brought that up.
*  They were, cause I was taking notes as the game was going along.
*  It was 76 to 61, I think.
*  And, and there was a four point play by good Dirich.
*  Remember?
*  And, uh, and it just looked bleak, but at the end of the third quarter, they
*  were 15 for 29 from three.
*  They ended 15 for 39, 0 for 10 from three.
*  Um, what's so the, I love Olympic basketball so much for the moments
*  because the hierarchy the way, and we'll talk about Tatum later, we've got the
*  DMP, but the hierarchy and who the three or four guys are, I talked about this
*  before the tournament and it just felt like they were giving LeBron the car keys.
*  So he was clearly one and you knew Curry was going to be out there
*  because of the trust with Kerr.
*  And then the question was who was the third guy?
*  And Embiid looked out of shape in the, uh, in the little, the exhibition games.
*  And it just didn't seem like he was going to be reliable.
*  And I thought it was going to be Davis was going to be the third guy, but man,
*  Embiid had, I think my favorite stretch of basketball he's ever played.
*  And if you're going to make the case for Philadelphia to be a 2025 title
*  team, it's like, does this guy have this in him?
*  And I honestly wasn't sure.
*  I think this was the happiest I've ever been after an Embiid game, Mahoney.
*  I know he's done it in regular season spots.
*  He's done it in earlier in the playoff series type of spots, but I feel like he
*  needed what happened today more than anyone else on the team.
*  It also seemed like the most emotional and emotive he's ever been, right?
*  He was into this game.
*  He wanted those moments so badly.
*  I've never seen him react the way he reacted when he walled up Jokic in the
*  post and forced to travel, forced to turn over, monster play.
*  And the fact that so much of the offense was running through him down
*  the stretch is a mystifying thing, given the way that these Olympics have started
*  for him, given the way he's played in so many of these games, but you're right
*  that when these moments come, the ball kind of finds its place and it found it.
*  It found itself in the hands of LeBron more often than not.
*  He was dictating a lot of the action and with Embiid in the middle of the floor,
*  attacking, finding little pockets, getting to his pull up jumper, all the stuff that
*  won him the MVP and makes him such a dominant NBA player, but that we haven't
*  seen for the last two and a half weeks.
*  And so for all of that to finally come together for him, and it wasn't a perfect
*  game, he was certainly as guilty as anyone as far as why USA was in the hole to begin
*  with, like what he wasn't doing defensively in terms of stepping up to the level was a
*  problem.
*  Him giving up defensive rebounds down the stretch or what were offensive rebounds
*  for Serbia, huge issue.
*  But he also came up with every huge fucking bucket when they needed it.
*  And that's, that's all you can really ask of a guy like that.
*  Yeah, I wrote down 7867, eight minutes left.
*  Yokich got a layup.
*  Yokich is doing all the tricks at this point, and he wasn't shooting that great,
*  but he's doing his little inbounds trick where it's like the ball's bouncing for
*  three, four seconds.
*  He's throwing it to the ref to buy two, three more seconds.
*  And it was just, he felt like the cagiest guy on the floor.
*  And it felt like USA was moving toward a little hero ball where it was like, okay,
*  do I have to do it?
*  And I, I was thinking they were going to lose and LeBron was just going to go into
*  I'll decide this either way and miss some threes and there, and that was it.
*  There's a six point play with seven minutes left where Katie hits the three.
*  Yokich either pushes AD in the KD or AD pulls himself with Yokich.
*  Hard to say what happened.
*  And also amazing that Katie didn't like have a season ending injury because he
*  had a guy falling into his knees as a shooting makes the three fourth foul on
*  Yokich and then the USA gets the ball back and Booker hits the three.
*  And we went from 78 to 67 to 78 to 73.
*  And now it's like, Oh, okay.
*  Here we go.
*  This is, this is what we're doing.
*  But the bead part you're talking about scored seven straight, uh, had a huge block
*  and got it to 84, 82 leading to the LeBron lefty layup house.
*  Would it, what did you see?
*  Because I, I agree with Rob.
*  There was some deficiencies there with the defensive rebounding.
*  They were definitely attacking him and Steph in the first half.
*  But on the other hand, it was the most engaged two way.
*  I want to be the dominant guy and bead.
*  And I I'm sure Yokich was a piece of it.
*  He's playing with LeBron and dudes like that, but man, I, I, I kind
*  of needed to see that from him.
*  Where'd you stand?
*  I'm over the top glass half full on everything I saw out of and bead, you
*  know, when he, when he did the up and under the up fake Joker bit, and then
*  he went right to the hole.
*  He got the flush.
*  He landed.
*  He rolled over and I, you know, I put on the Twitter machine, uh, that, that to
*  me was like the most impressive bucket of his entire basketball career, because
*  I mean, yes, hyperbole, yes, prisoner of the moment, but name me another game
*  that Joel and beads played in with higher stakes, the stakes were at the highest.
*  Two game sevens against Toronto in 2019.
*  Yes.
*  And then the Celtics game seven and against in Boston when, uh, when they
*  just got smacked and then the Atlanta game when Ben Simmons murdered them.
*  Those were the three biggest games he's ever played.
*  And he's going up against the Joker, his MVP foil.
*  I mean, I wish this game was 80 minutes.
*  I enjoyed it.
*  I wish we had four 20 minutes quarters.
*  That's how much I was enjoying it, but he was up to the task.
*  He deserved to be on the floor for that last seven minutes.
*  He was a full on bad-ass.
*  There was no question about it.
*  And, and kudos to Kerr for falling on his ass and finding out a desperation, the
*  right lineup at the end of the game for Christ sakes.
*  Well, so we talked, Mahoney and I talked about what the best
*  lineups that we had seen were.
*  And this current, it was basically Curry, Drew Booker, LeBron and AD.
*  And then the last two minutes they took drew out, put Katie in for him.
*  And that turned out to be the lineups.
*  I don't know if we mentioned that lineup.
*  Mahoney, when we talked about.
*  Well, that's the most time.
*  Cause yeah.
*  Well, cause I think Kerr really wanted the defense.
*  Yes.
*  But a couple of issues happen.
*  Um, Edwards, who I think we all love the moment seemed a little big for him today.
*  And he missed wide open shots and he was turning the ball over.
*  And I think what they thought they were going to get from him in this game, it
*  just wasn't there.
*  And I think by the second half, they realized that, um, which I think is a
*  good thing that he realized it.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  I, I was a little worried coming into the Olympics with Ant.
*  Is he going to try to take a moment that isn't his?
*  Is he going to try to rise to the occasion?
*  Cause we know the confidence is there.
*  We know the game is generally there.
*  He just didn't quite have it in this one.
*  And this is exactly the sort of weird, atypical defensive look that gave him
*  trouble in the playoffs too, you know, slightly different NBA zone in that
*  situation, but you could see him passing it up to Katie, trying to get the ball
*  out of his hands, find his spot on the wing and let these other guys go to work.
*  Yeah.
*  And then, and then the Katie piece of it, cause he didn't really get going either,
*  but that the game was so destroyed in the first half, but 93, 91 under 40 seconds
*  left, Joker has a quick to USA needs a bucket and it, and it's so funny how
*  this happens in the Olympics.
*  And I remember this happened in 2008 when they're all looking at each other.
*  And then Kobe's like, I got this guys.
*  It's kind of who's going to step up and Katie had the ball at the top, 28 feet
*  away and somebody's going to send him pick and he's waving the dude off.
*  He's like, I'm fucking Kevin Durant.
*  I'm one of the best 16 players of all time of the best scoring forward ever.
*  And guess what?
*  I'm going to score on this dude right now and puts up a 20 footer.
*  So it's funny.
*  He wasn't the three stars of the game, but in a lot of ways, it was one of
*  the great Katie moments, like he has those two threes against Cleveland and,
*  and 17 and 18.
*  Um, he's had obviously a million great moments over his career is the foot on
*  his line shot against, against Brooklyn that could have won them the series and
*  misses by six inches, but I'm always going to remember that one house that was,
*  uh, I will put on the big boy pants for us right now jumper.
*  And it wasn't an easy one.
*  It was a 20 footer with a hand in his face.
*  Well, you, again, if you're a narrative lover, it makes sense.
*  Cause he just jumped over Lisa Leslie for the all time Olympic score for the
*  United States team.
*  So like, if you're just wanting to put a bow on the KD Olympic legacy, that
*  shot made a whole lot of sense.
*  And I really just reveled in seeing the Bron and, and Curry and Katie second
*  half, cause it took, it took a while for him to get cooking.
*  I was nervous.
*  I'm glad I didn't fire off anything to you guys about God damn it.
*  Get Katie out of there.
*  Cause I certainly feeling that way.
*  I was feeling it, but I, I resisted the urge.
*  And by God he came through because he's, he is our Olympic hero.
*  Well, the other thing, Mahoney, so I'm, I'm watching the game.
*  My wife does the classic comes home with three minutes left, which is just
*  been a staple of our 26 years together.
*  Um, comes home, has a story to tell me.
*  And I'm kind of like, Hey, hold on.
*  I got to do a podcast after, but I was trying to, I've learned over the
*  years how to manage that one.
*  And she's like, Oh, I didn't know.
*  And so she sits down knowing nothing.
*  First question was, why is this so close?
*  And she hasn't watched one minute of Olympic basketball, but she
*  watches the rest of the game.
*  And she's going, wow, this is so cool that all these guys are out there together.
*  And it was like, I was like, that's going to be the best part of my podcast.
*  Cause we forget we've been immersed in Olympic basketball for weeks, but
*  ultimately it's like, Hey, you know, it's fucking cool.
*  Katie and Curry and LeBron and, uh, and Embiid and, you know, some of the
*  best guys in the league all out there at the exact same time.
*  Joker.
*  For Christ's sake.
*  Absolutely.
*  Going against Joker and a bunch of Serbians who were like out of their
*  mind could not have been more excited to be there.
*  And every big, every big play down the stretch that Team USA made, it's not
*  just one of those stars making it, but another one enabling it.
*  It's Curry curling around in Embiid screen for a go ahead three.
*  When LeBron hit that lefty layup to go ahead, it was because Katie brought the
*  ball up and you could see in his eyes, he wanted that left wing pull up three so
*  bad and the time just was a little bit off and he bailed and kicked it to LeBron.
*  And set up that play.
*  There's a precursor for all those where one of these stars is helping the other
*  one, which means guess what?
*  You're playing like an actual basketball team.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, then the Curry piece.
*  So on the one hand, you could say kept him in there.
*  On the other hand, he was part of the defensive disaster that was
*  happening in the first half, but he was hitting shots and the swagger came back,
*  which we have just not seen.
*  And I made a joke near the end of the Tuesday podcast about Lori Barkan and
*  decided to reject the gold state trade and Mahoney was like, Oh, too soon.
*  Like he, he reacted like it was like some terrible response.
*  He really did.
*  It was like, I had punched you.
*  Um, but that was, that was the old school current.
*  What was really cool.
*  He was flying around.
*  I mean, this was like old school 14, 15, 16 era Curry where it, when he's
*  going so fast, it feels like he's kind of levitating above.
*  So you would that piece.
*  I, I, what did he have eight threes, 36 points, nine threes.
*  But here's the important thing to your point, the point you just made eight
*  rebounds, the dude was flying around.
*  He was around the basket.
*  That was the key is huge.
*  And with that said, we've praised Curry and Embiid.
*  I think LeBron was the MVP of this game.
*  Oh, you like the triple double?
*  I like the triple double.
*  And there was a couple of big boy moments here where he was just like, I've been
*  doing this for 20 years.
*  I know how these games go.
*  Um, I'm going to the basket.
*  I'm going as hard as I possibly can.
*  I'm one of the greatest athletes of all time.
*  I'll probably be able to pull up a layup.
*  I might be able to get fouled, but I'm just going to trust this two decade
*  process I've had of good things happen when I just attack, um, there was no
*  hesitation at all.
*  There was like serene, supreme, serene confidence.
*  And you know, I've been in the camp of like, I don't know if he's one of the
*  top 10 players in the world anymore.
*  I don't, I don't think from, we're talking from an MBA standpoint, he's hurt,
*  you know, 20 games of the season.
*  His team hasn't succeeded though.
*  And then there's the other side was like, no, he's definitely still one of the
*  five best guys.
*  Like, what are you saying?
*  You're crazy.
*  This was an absolute resume statement of like throw out the playoff results.
*  The last two years, this is still one of the guys.
*  What'd you see Mahoney?
*  Well, as far as big boy moments go, the biggest of boy moments is LeBron
*  basically saying down the stretch, I'm guarding Nikola Jokic.
*  Like he was the one in the post battling him, fighting him off spots.
*  And they were doing a lot of that so they could switch more pick and roll action.
*  And use them beat as a Rover.
*  Totally.
*  And that's the reason that works is because LeBron is up for that challenge.
*  It's just, I hear your point about where he is in the MBA hierarchy.
*  I think it's totally fair to think of him as someone kind of on the borderline
*  of that top 10 range in terms of what he can produce, right?
*  In terms of the actual offense that he himself generates.
*  But in a moment...
*  And he's been two third team all MBAs in a row.
*  Like there's just anecdotal evidence.
*  Like, hey, it's maybe not there anymore.
*  Age, injury, the way he needs to pace himself in the regular season a little bit.
*  What he is on defense in some regular season games.
*  Those are all valid parts of his resume at this point.
*  But in terms of control in these moments and who you want dictating terms,
*  he's still that guy.
*  He's still, if not the number one option, you know, Jokic certainly is as good at
*  that as anybody.
*  He has to be up there with everybody.
*  Like he is so incredible at understanding the stakes of every possession in close
*  games and understanding exactly where the ball needs to go.
*  And not every star can do that.
*  Even, even the most like transit, like transcendent athletes can't always find
*  that exact happy medium that he seems to.
*  Yeah.
*  It's the Gladwell 10,000 hours house.
*  When he was going against Jokic and there had been some bad blood with, but I don't
*  know what Bogdanovich was so mad about.
*  Cause they announced it was like, he's yelling at Carmelo again.
*  And they was like, can you guys give us like some context what's happening?
*  Cause Bogdanovich is the maddest guy in the entire Olympics.
*  Even more mad than the guy who hit his dick on the pole vote and ended up knocking
*  the pole vote thing off.
*  It might work okay for him.
*  Yeah.
*  Longterm that guy's doing great.
*  Great job.
*  But when LeBron was batting with Jokic, I was like, man, it would be really
*  fun here if, if this got even a little more heated, you know, cause Jokic has
*  won three of VPs in four years.
*  He's beat LeBron two years in a row.
*  And I was like, is this, how far is this going to escalate?
*  Poor Jokic is going against Scott LeBron guarding him.
*  He's also embied.
*  Oh, and then we're going to throw Davis and we're going to throw Bam at you.
*  It's like, like talk about the all time gauntlet.
*  He missed some threes.
*  His threes just haven't been here in the Olympics.
*  It's been that, and teams are giving them to him, but I, you know, it was fun to
*  watch him watch him battle.
*  What'd you see from LeBron has.
*  Well, I mean, we did say at the outset of the tournament that, um, there's a
*  reason he was leading the odds to win MVP of this tournament.
*  Um, I like that investment that we made there.
*  I hope a lot of that's that's, that's almost a lot.
*  He'd have to be, he'd have to go what?
*  Oh, for 15 in the gold medal game to not get that.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I don't know what the circumstances would be, but, uh, the, the, the most
*  impressive thing is the age, like, you know, you said 10,000 hours, the homies
*  at 200,000 hours, I mean, the greatest lifetime performer in the game of
*  basketball has ever seen he is unparalleled and still the two things to be that jumped
*  off where the combination of basketball IQ and poise, both of which translated
*  into like, we're not losing, we're not going to lose.
*  I'm not going to permit us to lose.
*  And I will say that I sitting and watching at no point felt like we were going to
*  lose.
*  Um, now I felt eight minutes left.
*  I genuinely thought they're going to lose.
*  I felt like it was falling apart.
*  Well, I was in the live biting markets looking, um, lustfully at a lot of
*  the plus odds for the U S.
*  Were they plus when they were down?
*  Oh, they were down plus two 30.
*  Yeah.
*  You could get, you could get plus two 30.
*  I I'm too slow.
*  I have fat fingers.
*  So I only got plus two Oh five at one point in there.
*  But yeah.
*  Um, the, the, you know, the, the, the thing is, um, ultimately Serbia all credit
*  to them, they're like one guy short, which is not a knock, you know, I mean,
*  they were, they were there for, uh, 37 of the 40 minutes.
*  And then the U S did what it did with the depth of talent and took care of it
*  right at the end.
*  Yeah.
*  I was going to get mad at the Serbia coach because they ran out of timeouts
*  because I wanted them to call timeout and they didn't have any timeouts.
*  But I asked, so I thought when they called all the timeouts were the right
*  spots for the timeouts, you just don't necessarily get enough of them.
*  One point on LeBron.
*  I was thinking, you know, you go back to where he was in Oh, eight and Oh,
*  nine and 2010 and 2011, which feels like a fucking lifetime ago.
*  Like we, we hadn't even started it.
*  We started Grant land there in the 2011 finals, right?
*  Which was like the lowest moment of his career.
*  And some of the wraps with him at the time were, you know, when it, when it
*  comes to nut crunch time, you can really see him feeling it.
*  He's not strong enough.
*  He loses command of what to do in big moments.
*  Um, and not only is all that stuff gone, but now, now it's flipped in the
*  complete opposite way where he's hit that same point that Kobe definitely hit
*  in Oh, eight in the Olympics.
*  Um, Jordan obviously was always there in the nineties KD.
*  You can feel it at least offensively, but these certain guys where you're just
*  like, we're probably going to lose unless.
*  And it's like, you start looking around and it's like, who, who do you completely
*  trust? Who do we feel good here?
*  And I just can't believe LeBron still has that in him at age 40.
*  It's it's it's now into that Brady mid 2010s kind of like, how is this still
*  happening?
*  This doesn't make like Brady, not to compare it to Brady coming back from
*  20 to three against Atlanta, but there was a moment there was like, how is he
*  still doing this?
*  And then he wins the super bowl of Tampa and you're like, how the fuck is this
*  still happening?
*  This shouldn't happen for basketball players.
*  No, what the bronze doing?
*  Like he, you shouldn't be able to go coast to coast with the same kind of speed you
*  had 14, 15 years ago, but that his athletic ability at age 40 was one of the
*  reasons they won the game.
*  It wasn't just the smarts.
*  Like he big boy, these guys.
*  And you know, he doesn't have the top of the square vertical that he used to have.
*  He doesn't have necessarily the end to end breakneck speed, but body control
*  coordination, all the stuff that leads you to go from a dead sprint into a soft
*  ass finger roll.
*  He has all those things still.
*  He has all of that at his command.
*  It's, it's incredible to watch him at this point.
*  I love watching him with this team and I'm glad we got this moment with real stakes.
*  I'm glad house.
*  You may have been confident.
*  I was Googling, like, how do I get Serbian citizenship?
*  Like I'm, I'm ready to flip.
*  I thought this thing was done.
*  And so to watch even, even in, even with being as confident in LeBron's abilities
*  as I am, I didn't know that he and these guys had quite this in them to come back
*  from that kind of deficit.
*  When they just hadn't played well all game and they found it exactly when they needed to.
*  Yeah.
*  So I was 90% rooting for USA having a heart attack, 3% thinking about our France bet.
*  Just cause on the 20 year anniversary of us winning Argentina 10 to one, I just,
*  you know, couldn't help but think about that.
*  And then my love for Yokeage, who's my favorite non Celtic other than Curry.
*  It was weird.
*  The Curry head to head battle for non Celtics.
*  I love the most for your heart.
*  I just, I just love Yokeage and I, he made a couple of play when they, he's just
*  being double triple team, they're just beating the shit out of them.
*  And he's doing like Yokeage stuff and getting shots off.
*  I was like, man, if this guy pulls this off, this would be just incredible.
*  And beating him, beating this team with Bogdanovich, Mieczic, who's like
*  Charlotte's 13th man, and then a bunch of guys I've never heard of.
*  And they're like, I'm not sure.
*  And then a bunch of guys I've never heard of and they're going to beat what I
*  think is the most talented Olympic team we've had in 32 years.
*  All right.
*  So we talked about lineups in previous podcasts here and how, when you have a
*  game like this, the lineups, they shorten the rotation, shorten, you have fourth
*  quarters where maybe six guys play and some guys end up being losers.
*  And I, the box scores I've seen, they don't have all the official minutes yet,
*  but Dan didn't play nearly as much.
*  Derek White didn't play nearly as much.
*  Aunt lost a bunch of minutes.
*  Katie seemed like he lost some minutes.
*  And then the big one was Tatum didn't play.
*  And we talked on Tuesday about why Tatum probably wouldn't play in this game,
*  especially if it was close because his shot has betrayed him.
*  I find it hard to believe he's going to play in 2028 now.
*  I'm just going to throw that out there.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  On, on, but you think he will not elect to show up?
*  I have no inside information at all.
*  Okay.
*  I'm just saying that you, when you're making hard choices like this, I think
*  there's going to be ramifications down the line would be like, I feel like
*  you're daring the aggregators now.
*  You're just, you're just dangling the bait.
*  I just said, I have no inside information whatsoever.
*  That's not going to stop anybody.
*  This is, this is now an embarrassing, embarrassing tournament for Tatum.
*  I just don't see him playing again.
*  It's not.
*  It's not embarrassing.
*  He was top five all NBA three years in a row.
*  He just won the title.
*  He's literally not playing in these games.
*  So let me ask you this question.
*  If he was on the floor in place of LeBron or Kevin Durant, do you think that they
*  would have pulled off this game?
*  I don't.
*  Not the way he's shooting.
*  Well, the problem is now it's too late.
*  Like you needed him to have been worked into these rotations and for him to
*  understand what his role and contribution was going to be seven games ago, right.
*  In the friendlies, like getting big minutes and getting big.
*  What's it going to happen?
*  I said on Tuesday, I didn't think he was going to play in this game.
*  So, so now I just wonder there's going to be bad blood with some of this stuff.
*  I'll be really excited to see how it plays out.
*  They're going to come out with the biggest olive branch possible.
*  Cause this is it.
*  This is it for Curry.
*  This is it for Durant and this is it for LeBron.
*  So it is going to be a team that very well could be led by Jason Tatum because
*  of the group that's that's on the team right now.
*  He's he's the, the, to me, the sort of natural leader coming out.
*  I mean, so that would be the argument.
*  Maybe you sprinkle a couple of minutes in, but, um, he, the thing is Kerr's not
*  going to worry about 2028, right?
*  You lose any of these games and it's on your permanent record.
*  And I was getting a bunch of texts just in the first half, like, what the
*  fuck are these rotations?
*  What's he doing?
*  Is what you're saying.
*  Well, it was, it was, I mean, he definitely looked like he was grasping
*  for, for straws in a lot of ways, but I'll be interested to see how it plays out.
*  It's pretty significant that the biggest game that this country has played in,
*  in three years and a DMP for Tatum.
*  But I also don't know whose minutes he would have taken.
*  I can't think of a single player he should have played in front of.
*  Well, and think about the gold medal game.
*  If it had been Germany in front of them, Tatum would be a great Franz
*  Wagner antidote as it stands.
*  I can't believe I'm saying this.
*  Is he the Gershon Yabusele answer?
*  Ooh, I love it.
*  Gershon Yabusele answer.
*  The fact you need an answer to the questions that Yabusele presents.
*  What a time to be alive.
*  But, but honestly, like as far as, you know, burly forwards who are going
*  to be able to combat his size, like LeBron is a great answer there, Durant too.
*  But Tatum could be another guy that they throw out, whether it's Yabusele,
*  whether it's the sore, like they're going to need forward physicality from somewhere.
*  It can't all be guards and bigs.
*  Like that range of players going to have to be really important for a team USA.
*  Yeah.
*  The rebounding today, they had 33 rebounds total and LeBron and Curry had 20 of the 33.
*  I'm not sure how that's, they diagrammed that before the game.
*  That's where, like the fact that Tatum isn't shooting well, I think really
*  has hurt this team because fundamentally he is like one of the missing pieces
*  that they need because he's such a good defender and he's got size and he can
*  rebound and theoretically he should be able to spread the floor.
*  You saw over and over again in both halves, they were leaving somebody open and hoping
*  they weren't going to make threes.
*  And it was Edwards for a little while.
*  They were never, they're never trying to leave KD open, but they were leaving BAM
*  open, they let the Booker go ahead and knock yourself out and Booker, by the way,
*  I think is a big winner of this tournament.
*  As we talked about before, he was out there for them and it's a pretty big moment.
*  So he ended up playing 24 minutes.
*  BAM only played 10, Davis only played 10.
*  So Davis was the one who probably lost the most minutes out of what we would've
*  thought because Embiid ended up 27 minutes and he was eight for 11 from the field.
*  So you, so you guys are less pessimistic than me about the Tatum 2028 thing.
*  Cause I do think that's going to be a possible storyline.
*  It's a complete rewrite.
*  We're going to have a brand new team.
*  It's going to be, you know, some young guys, maybe we haven't even
*  considered at this point.
*  It's going to be, look, nothing like that.
*  The team that's on the floor at the moment.
*  They just need a little classic American propaganda, how it was Tatum in a time out,
*  given an impassioned speech that rallied these guys, they really turned everything
*  around. Like you just need a little bit of background narrative.
*  Well, at one point in the fourth quarter, he was the only guy who still had his
*  warmup on. I was like, just take the warmup off.
*  So you fit in with the team photos better.
*  Yeah. So you think like four years from now, LeBron's gone, Curry's gone,
*  Durant's gone.
*  And there's this new wave of, by that time, like Cooper flag might be ready.
*  All this dudes. Yeah, right.
*  We're thinking ahead. Now you're talking.
*  For, for Serbia, that's probably Jokic's best chance ever.
*  Cause he's going to be four years.
*  God only knows where Jokic is four years from now.
*  I mean, is he still playing basketball?
*  We have no idea.
*  That's probably their best chance to win.
*  Let's talk about France and how it ties into the United States game.
*  Incredible.
*  France beats Germany in what turned out to be an absolute rock fight.
*  Wemby goes four for 17 and actually wins.
*  And in the most important news, I'm back out on the Franz Wagner extension.
*  I'm out. It's been another flip-flop.
*  It's been two days.
*  I'm up to three Franz Wagner extension flip-flops this summer.
*  Seems too high now.
*  I don't know if I like it.
*  Fragile and Franz.
*  I mean, there's a lot of names we can pull together here.
*  That dude, I sent around to our group.
*  What does he think he's in Cleveland?
*  Does he think it's game seven in Cleveland again?
*  Like, you know, show off.
*  Show up.
*  This is the moment.
*  This is the stage.
*  You just got 250 million bucks, homie.
*  Show everybody what you're all about.
*  And they let these French bangers suck the life out of them.
*  Is it me?
*  I mean, we do have a new big three, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Bisselli.
*  Les Sores.
*  Les Sores.
*  Yeah.
*  And, and, uh, the new big three just banging bodies.
*  I was looking at all their basketball reference, whatever, whatever stats they
*  had in it and, uh, coordinate doesn't hit threes, which I guess that's why
*  he's not an NBA player.
*  The sort doesn't hit threes either.
*  And it's just the type of guy I would like.
*  I, we were texting during the game, like who, what NBA player is he?
*  Is he.
*  I thought he was Montrez Harrell.
*  I thought he was a little strong.
*  Yeah.
*  Like Montrez Harrell with, with more of like a low post, like drop step type
*  game.
*  Um, so I guess there are guys that have, but it's just funny to watch them in
*  this format and they just become superhuman.
*  Here's where I'll start with the France game now ties in the U S though.
*  The home court advantage was out of control.
*  And if they think, if the U S thinks there was pressure and tension in the
*  game today, just wait, cause we're going, we're going up a level.
*  We're doing this final tap.
*  We're going from 10 to 11.
*  It's, it's going up and we got big bodies and all kinds of things going up.
*  But, uh, what'd you, what'd you see in that France game, Rob?
*  Well, one thing we talked about on Tuesday was Nick Patum again, pressuring
*  full court, picking up guards, hounding guys.
*  I don't know what the equivalent for that's going to be against team USA
*  because so much of it does run through LePron.
*  That's not really a guy you can press full court so easily as, as a smaller
*  guard, but I just continue to be impressed with Patum in particular, honestly,
*  all the veteran guys for France.
*  Kind of finding their roles within this new order, you know, even Rudy
*  Gobert finding his role of waving a towel.
*  Coming into coming into rebound off of free throws.
*  Look, he's a Patriot.
*  He's a true Patriot.
*  Yes, that's right.
*  Um, house is Rudy eligible for the Ewing theory because he did play a couple of
*  minutes, but they're in France taking off the moment they decided to remove him
*  from the rotation and the fact that he's never won a championship, I think makes
*  him Ewing theory eligible.
*  So I'm going to say he counts.
*  It's a one of one career, a guy who has to be off the floor at the highest
*  leverage moments.
*  He just could not be on the floor.
*  I was one like seven defensive players of the year and got traded for five
*  first round picks and a whole bunch of other shit.
*  Can't be on the floor.
*  Um, that French game plan in terms of just making it uncomfortable for Germany.
*  Cause I coming in the handicap for me was Germany has the second best, second
*  most sophisticated half court offense of any team in the tournament.
*  And a lot of that is the comfort level of them playing together.
*  They move well.
*  There's a chemistry there.
*  Um, I had them behind the United States in terms of half court offense, cause we
*  can score from all five spots, but, um, France just wouldn't let it happen.
*  I mean, no, Germany got out to the lead that they got out to by running their
*  half court offense and Franz showed up in the first quarter, you know, not, not
*  the one that that's the end of the game, but the one at the beginning of the game.
*  He showed up for, and you know, they, uh, they out rebounded Germany after
*  getting out rebounded a week ago.
*  They protected the ball a little bit better than, than, than, uh,
*  they handle the pressure that Mahoney that we're calling for in the last
*  time they actually handled it.
*  Yeah.
*  And forced turnovers.
*  Like Germany is not a high turnover team.
*  They run very efficiently and yet they were stymied and they look frustrated
*  and they look like they couldn't get to their spots in terms of that execution
*  that we've grown used to from them over these last couple of years.
*  German Steve Nash turned back into Dennis Schroeder.
*  That was, that was the subplot.
*  I was surprised to see that.
*  Um, listen, the Olympics, it's where I wrote down Fournier
*  turns into a big game player.
*  Yep.
*  Yabaseli turns into Charles Barkley.
*  Cordnier turns into Andrei Guadala.
*  Lesort turns into Farid on steroids and Schroeder becomes Steve Nash.
*  Like this is just for whatever reason, what happens with this FIBA style.
*  Weird guys change identities and turn into these different types of basketball
*  players, which was so much fun about the U S like just LeBron, Curry, KD and
*  beat all playing like the hits basically.
*  But what has, uh, what has Jason Tatum turned into?
*  I have no comment.
*  Okay.
*  So Germany was in the first game.
*  They beat the hell out of France when they played them earlier in the Olympics.
*  They were 12 for 26 from three.
*  In this game, they missed 19 of their first 26, and it was just a brick fest.
*  I think what's crazy about this France win, Wemby goes four for 17.
*  France was six for 27 from three at one point.
*  It's not like that was like, it was the opposite of, Oh, this is how you upset
*  somebody, you shoot the lights out in the Olympics and your best player plays.
*  Awesome.
*  And they, it wasn't like that at all, but their defense was awesome house.
*  You made a lot of Wemby jokes to me during the game.
*  Um, where do we land ultimately with his performance in that game?
*  It's fine.
*  I think this is like the appropriate seasoning of Wemby.
*  He is, he's a child, right?
*  These are men, these are men playing banger basketball.
*  Like the difference offensively for France was that Yabba Salih and
*  Lesort combined for 11 of 16.
*  And all of those are paint points, right?
*  That's it was man's basketball.
*  It was, and it was nice to see a couple of times, uh, uh, Wemby assert himself
*  when he's, he's like, Hey, I'm right by the basket.
*  I can dunk.
*  I'm going to try and dunk.
*  I would love to see a lot more of that, but he just doesn't have the ass for it yet.
*  I mean, he's just a youth and he'll get those, um, those baby deer legs.
*  We'll get some meat on them here.
*  Um, you know, God will give them that gift and then we'll, we'll start to see that
*  back to the basket element for him.
*  Way too many threes out of him.
*  Um, he did make a huge one to stifle, um, you know, the Germany pushback, but, uh,
*  it's fine.
*  It's the seasoning of it.
*  He's a kid.
*  I'm totally satisfied with it, my honey.
*  This is the start of something for him.
*  And honestly, if we're going to talk about France's defense, a lot of it is
*  predicated on having him behind them and go bear could have done some facsimile
*  of that, but Wemby is that much more dynamic, that much ranger, that much more
*  able to play up to the level around screens and around various actions.
*  And so the fact that you can be so physical and muck the game up the way
*  that France has a lot of that is because Wemby is there to cover for so much.
*  Well, and then they also gave 25 Rudy go bear minutes to other guys in the team.
*  And I, I don't even a hundred percent blame him because you just don't,
*  what is there to blame him for?
*  What has he done?
*  Well, because you just don't need him.
*  If you have Wemby, there's no reason to have both guys and Wemby is the future
*  of the team and Wemby is the guy everyone in France wants to see out there.
*  And Wemby could have gone two for 35 and then we're going to take
*  them out of the fourth quarter.
*  But he did enough good stuff defensively and with his hands and just being active
*  and threatening and you could see the guys and he is basically what we saw in
*  the NBA season guys dribbling toward the basket, seeing him and doing like a
*  double take.
*  He, my complaint is just that Wemby isn't, um, old enough, mature enough,
*  sophisticated enough with this basketball IQ to be a perimeter defender and let
*  go bear be the, the, the rim protector to be the basket stopper.
*  And that's not a knock on Wemby.
*  I just wish he was like two years ahead in his development so that we could see
*  that version of the French French defense.
*  That's the thing.
*  It's not unreasonable to ask that of him.
*  Like he's going to be able to do some of that stuff at some point.
*  That's what's so scary about his future.
*  So they got it to six.
*  They blew three straight possessions.
*  They had, I think 16 turnovers, but then France, it's a three to cut it to
*  39 seconds left.
*  They get a stop.
*  Franz gets the rebound and just can't keep it in the minimum goes out of bounds.
*  We were robbed of this awesome last 10 seconds of Germany with the ball down to,
*  which I'm sure Schroeder would have tried to create something, but, um, I do
*  feel like neutral site Germany wins that game.
*  And I think the home court, um, just to reinvigorate Evan Fournier of all people
*  as this huge big game, you can count on him guy making shots like that should
*  tell you all I need to know.
*  I genuinely like Yabba Silly though.
*  He's been awesome.
*  Like, like I wonder like what, like, uh, the, the other guy to just like the
*  Fareed Montrez Harrell thing.
*  We've seen that it can maybe work on the right team, but ultimately you're going
*  to be able to patch stuff together, but it's not the kind of guy who could be in
*  a seven man rotation on a NBA team that could win the title.
*  The stuff Yabba Silly does.
*  I don't know.
*  Like, could, could he be, what is it?
*  What is he in the NBA Rob?
*  Is he like a, a three point shooting three who can bang and who can switch on D
*  but also maybe you can play small ball four with him.
*  I just feel like he's actually an NBA rotation guy.
*  I think he's like, maybe not quite as good, but the model would be like a PJ
*  Washington type player, right?
*  Like a combo three, four can guard like a wide range of players, but he's a
*  little more physical inside.
*  I think that's the difference is where Washington is a little more spot up.
*  Yabba Silly can do that, but he, like he can bang in there and that's what makes
*  him valuable and honestly what makes the store valuable too is these guys who
*  don't just create space, but know how to use it and capitalize on the fact that
*  the lane is suddenly open and if you just put a body into somebody, you can draw
*  fouls or you can get layups.
*  Mahoney, what'd you see from Kula Ballad today that excited you?
*  That's so rude.
*  Come on.
*  Oh, I forgot he's on the Wizards house.
*  My bad.
*  I didn't mean to do that to you.
*  Is that necessary?
*  I'm sorry about that.
*  Kula Ball is good.
*  I'm team Kula Ballet for the record.
*  He's going to be a very important part of the French national team's future.
*  Okay.
*  Let's knock the Wizards.
*  Let's talk.
*  Let's let's talk out USA France.
*  So like Yabba Silly, the sword, these dudes that seem so great when they're
*  going against Daniel Tice, now they're going to be going against and B and
*  LeBron and Pam out of bio and Anthony Davis.
*  And there's just way more size and length and you're not going to see
*  the sword backing down people and doing five second drop steps.
*  There's a case for France to hang around that doesn't involve home court advantage.
*  I just don't know what it is.
*  House.
*  What is it?
*  I'm not going to be able to make it.
*  Their guards stink.
*  They're so bad.
*  And Germany should have been in position to exploit that, but shooter had a bad game.
*  So they, they, they couldn't take advantage of it.
*  The, the U S I, I just, you, you can continue to get these banger buckets out
*  of Yabba Silly and, and Lesor, and I just don't think it's enough.
*  They just don't have the firepower.
*  They can't do the blueprint is what we just watched.
*  The Joker controlling the ball, you know, making the right play at the right time.
*  And then just rain threes, rain threes, rain threes French.
*  French doesn't have that rain.
*  The France, the French just don't have it.
*  Well, you know who agrees with you as Fandel because USA is minus 15 and a
*  half for the gold dental game, which is only a point less than they were
*  favored against Serbia.
*  Is there a case, Rob?
*  I think the case is probably similar to what we saw in the way that it will
*  have to be a very, very ugly game.
*  That that is Francis model.
*  Like I, the shooting will come and go for them sometimes.
*  Like Courtney is a great example of that.
*  Can shoot the lights out one game.
*  Absolutely wreck it.
*  The next, if guys like him are hot, if Evan Fournier is hitting enough of his
*  like weird bailout threes at the end of clock on possessions that go nowhere.
*  If you get enough of those things working for you and you're able to muck up the
*  game, then yeah, we've seen, you can throw team USA off its axis a little bit.
*  You can get those guys overthinking or over deferring or whatever that ends up
*  looking like in that moment.
*  But having the Americans go through a test like this against Serbia helps iron
*  out some of that stuff.
*  Like the Americans will be in better shape to combat an ugly game now having
*  been through one than they would have been otherwise.
*  And so that's, that's like a really important trial for a team that honestly
*  just hadn't really been tested yet.
*  So that's an interesting point because BS, I don't think that what we just
*  watched was necessarily an ugly game.
*  It was high execution by Serbia from the three point line that really tilted the
*  court.
*  Yeah, that game was good.
*  France, Germany was that way.
*  I mean, yeah, yeah, right.
*  So my question is, you know, the Francis ability to muck things up, to make it
*  ugly comes from the physicality, their ability to play full court press and to,
*  it slows the game down because it takes all of the time to get started in the
*  offense.
*  I expect them to try and repeat that.
*  How does the U S exploit it is my question.
*  By the way, Serbia was doing, Serbia was doing that to the U S in this game.
*  And they were exposing that U S was doing some weird shit with like BAM,
*  bringing the ball up.
*  Davis bringing the ball up to rent anytime anyone other than a real guard
*  wasn't bringing up Serbia was just on those dudes, making them work.
*  Even Edwards, they were attacking.
*  So I assume France is probably going to borrow that one as well.
*  I, I can't believe I'm saying this guys, Kyle, don't turn the tick tock camera.
*  I think France has to start at go bear in this game.
*  Wow.
*  This is the zag I never expected.
*  I got to say, I happen to watch and be and beat score 70 points on Wembee and it
*  was an absolute evisceration.
*  Now it was also unfortunately for Embiid, the highlight of the season,
*  destroying a lottery team.
*  Now he has the new highlight of the season, what he did against Serbia.
*  But I thought he had a lot of confidence and he has too much size for Wembee.
*  And if they just start Wembee without starting go bear too, I just think the
*  U S is going to attack Wembee and try to put fouls on them.
*  So if I'm, if I'm France and we know Embiid is going to play like the first
*  five, six minutes of the game, I'm probably playing go bear for those first
*  five, six minutes and then bringing in the sort and Yabba Silly together and
*  trying to have them bang against BAM and AD.
*  Is that crazy, Rob?
*  It's not crazy.
*  I agree with you that go bear is better suited to guarding Embiid than Wembee is.
*  The problem is we also just went through a playoff cycle where the discussion for
*  two weeks against the nuggets was, Oh, go bear guarding on ball in the post
*  against someone like Nicole Jokic doesn't work that great.
*  It's better having him behind, you know, roving.
*  And so maybe that's the answer, whether it's Wembee or go bear on the ball.
*  The combination of the two is what you want in terms of stifling a sort of low
*  post presence.
*  I just, I don't know.
*  I hear you and I think that's the best, maybe the best option that they have
*  available.
*  I think getting more length on the floor, generally speaking for protecting the
*  rim will be very helpful for them.
*  I just don't think it's going to matter very much.
*  I think they give up too much in terms of, you know, you put those guys on the
*  floor, Joel is just going to take shots from the elbow anyway.
*  Like what, what will that do for you having go bear guarding him in a sense
*  like that?
*  Maybe you put Lasor on them and you do the thing that we saw some NBA teams
*  where they use the six, five, six, six, 30 guy and get like right basically in
*  his chest.
*  And maybe you do that way.
*  I've already flip-flopped.
*  Maybe go bear doesn't play at all.
*  You talk me out of it, Rob.
*  Use the soren Yabaseli and just get right into the beads grill and do it that
*  way.
*  I like go bear out there.
*  I think let them go huge.
*  Start Wemby, go bear Yabaseli, Lasor, and I don't know, but here's the thing
*  that we're, we're, we must countenance that whistle is going to be, uh, what
*  did they say?
*  Alley blue, whatever.
*  It's going to be very Maison à la cuisine, cuisine à la maison, home cooking
*  whistle.
*  So they, if they want to come out and be physical, I do believe that that could be
*  an element that we need to factor into how we assess this thing.
*  Are you saying this is going to be the first game that LeBron didn't get calls
*  in since like 2008?
*  Is that your prediction?
*  I didn't think that he got, you know, he got appropriate calls and what we just
*  watched, but the refs were pretty fair in today's game.
*  I didn't love the, I didn't love Yokochi's fourth foul.
*  Yeah.
*  I actually would have challenged that if I was Serbia.
*  They're not great.
*  The refs in, in FIBA basketball generally, but they are kind of evenly
*  not great if that makes sense.
*  Excepting apparently France and the home cooking.
*  Yeah, I think it could be a little baguette on that one.
*  That, that Japanese for the four pointer against Japan, which is the single play
*  that has us in this very situation.
*  Unbelievable.
*  It's literally the reason why France is in the gold medal game.
*  Yes, I do think that they're susceptible to home court pressure.
*  That's all.
*  So House, what do we do?
*  We have France at plus 1500, but a really hard hedge situation with us as a 12 to
*  one favorite on Fandl.
*  It's expensive.
*  I don't, I hedge a little.
*  That's a tough one.
*  I don't even know.
*  This is the problem with hedging.
*  Hedging never works.
*  Um, I thought before we go, I thought of something as we were talking
*  out the go bear thing, just an amazing win for Embiid from where he was three
*  weeks ago, and he even, he looks thinner and in more shape.
*  Like he clearly just fucked up.
*  He came in, he wasn't in shape.
*  Maybe he's in better shape, but we've gone from, this is where I was at the
*  start of the tournament.
*  Like I wish Embiid wasn't on the team.
*  I wish it was just Bam and AD as the centers.
*  I wish they would give Tatum those minutes.
*  I w I just think that's a better version of this team.
*  And Embiid is just this weird piece that doesn't fit in with everything to now
*  thinking they really need them.
*  And France is going to have to figure out how to match up with them.
*  So when you think like, that's how far we've gone with Embiid in three weeks,
*  I'm going to say, if you're going big winners for team USA, it's, it's him.
*  It's LeBron.
*  Curry is now back in the winter column.
*  KD is, um, even only nine points today, but somehow gets the biggest basket of
*  the entire game and probably Booker.
*  And I think those, and, and Drew holiday, who had some good glue guys stuff that
*  he had drew holidays that I forgot to mention his defense for one stretch in the
*  fourth quarter was like out of control.
*  It looked like he was going against like the Mavs in the finals.
*  Like he was at that level, but especially Derek White committed the glue guy
*  mortal sin of fouling a three point shooter and won in a way that almost blew up
*  the game.
*  I don't think we saw him again.
*  That was it.
*  You get the hook at that point.
*  We might not see him for the rest of the Olympics.
*  This is what's so dope about single elimination though, is Joel has one game
*  like this in a moment like that.
*  And it, it erases kind of everything that came before, like who cares how you
*  performed against South Sudan in the group play.
*  Like it just doesn't matter if you, if you play like this when it matters.
*  And not only that it might translate into the most impactful storyline for this
*  upcoming basketball season, because if he, what he is learning, what he's getting
*  out of these experiences with this group of guys, and we've heard these stories,
*  you know, every four years you hear guys come from the Olympics and say, wow,
*  that was something I didn't anticipate.
*  It changed the course of my career.
*  It changed the course of my career.
*  And he really did look, he was the most nimble when he went down after that dunk,
*  after he beat the Joker, I was like, Oh my God, he's dead because he fell down three
*  times in the series against the Knicks.
*  And it looked like he was hurt all over again.
*  We weren't going to see him for another six months, but he looked, he was, he was
*  very, very good on his feet and miraculously it looked like he lost 10 pounds in one
*  week.
*  It was the James Harden 10 pound weight loss just out of nowhere, just from
*  exercising.
*  But in Paris, the first man to ever go to Paris and lose 10 pounds.
*  What's going on?
*  Yeah.
*  I've had this podcast since 07 and every four years we come out of the Olympics
*  and we talk about these guys and how important this experience is.
*  And Brasileo always makes fun of me for it.
*  But I really do think if you read the stories of the people, the season after,
*  like even Carmelo had the best year of his career in 09, the best after he was on
*  this team, LeBron went to a whole other level in 09.
*  Now that probably would have happened anyway, but he's credited being with Kobe.
*  They did that in the redeem team documentary.
*  There's that story about the guys were coming back from the club and Kobe was
*  going the other way because he was going to work out at five in the morning.
*  That's the kind of shit like if you're in bead.
*  You joined a team.
*  It was the process.
*  They're intentionally trying to lose games for years.
*  They don't care if you play or not.
*  They're just trying to collect assets.
*  They're not doing any sort of team building at all.
*  And they've made excuses for him the entire time he was there, but the
*  talent's always been there and you want an MVP.
*  And if I'm a Sixers fan, I'm watching this going, this is the greatest pot.
*  This is way better than the Paul George signing.
*  Like whatever we could just sign and bring in a new guy every year.
*  It's never going to matter unless.
*  Embiid gets it.
*  And I don't, I honestly don't know if he got it until maybe these last couple
*  weeks, I loved what I saw today from him.
*  Is that fair Rob, or am I being too hard?
*  Too hard in terms of what?
*  To say this is the most impactful, maybe two weeks stretch for him
*  as a player of his career.
*  That might be making a little more of it than it ends up being, but I do think
*  these moments are important to players like Embiid.
*  Like that's why him being as reactive jumps out to me.
*  Like this is clearly a game and a moment that was crucial for him,
*  that he felt the weight of.
*  And the fact that he felt it and succeeded frankly is not something
*  he's done in the NBA very often.
*  Like he has had a great regular season performance.
*  He's had great seasons.
*  He's had great singular moments in playoff series, but their first round
*  series or their lower stakes series.
*  This was a game that the USA absolutely had to win and they put the ball in his
*  hands and that vote of confidence means a lot and in delivering means a lot.
*  Whether, you know, whatever ends up happening for him in the sixers next
*  season, like I do think those are formative and instructive experiences
*  for stars in his position.
*  Yeah.
*  And how part of the, part of the case for him, maybe not totally getting it was
*  how we showed up for the Olympics.
*  I'm just going to throw that out there.
*  I mean, it's a fair criticism.
*  But look, man, to me, it changes the ceiling of that sixers team.
*  It always comes down to the same thing with them.
*  Can he be healthy in April?
*  Can Paul George be healthy in April?
*  I wish we could fast forward to April and both guys were healthy.
*  Then it would really be a super fun Eastern conference, a playoff situation.
*  But I'll just knock on wood and root for it because the Eastern conference is so
*  much better if both those guys are playing and, and Joel's at this, this level.
*  He's got, we just saw it.
*  We know he's got it in him.
*  You know, he dropped a 50 piece on the Knicks so that they, they, they didn't,
*  you know, get swept out of that series.
*  And here we have this Olympics game and he, he does look capable of getting in
*  shape, so fingers crossed.
*  That's where the Paul George part of it, I think is nice too, of the idea that
*  inching his team a little closer to not team USA talent, obviously, but putting
*  another star where he doesn't have to have the 50 and in some games can just be
*  the closer and be in a position that in his career with the six, it was just
*  never had the chance to do.
*  Last question before we go.
*  So seeing what we saw from LeBron today, if you're the Lakers, does that make you
*  change your mind at all about putting those picks on the table and trying to
*  get a real third star?
*  I would already have put that that they would have felt that way before.
*  But so you say no either way.
*  No, I would have already put the picks on the table.
*  Like I, I I'm of the opinion if LeBron James, one of the greatest players to
*  ever live who's still this good is on your team, you should be going forward
*  hard all the time.
*  That's, that's how I think that should be navigated.
*  But that's not Jeremy Grant.
*  It's somebody a notch above.
*  So the move for them is if he can keep at this level, you wait until December and
*  you see who's unhappy and you, and you go all in and you're not going to do it now
*  because there's no guy now.
*  Who's it going to be though?
*  It's, it's Trey Young.
*  The guy is, but there might be another unhappy guy coming.
*  Ideally, the NBA.
*  Janice.
*  He's going to be unhappy.
*  Get ready.
*  I know you don't think so, but get ready.
*  I hope it's not Jason Tatum.
