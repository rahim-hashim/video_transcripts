# De’Aaron Fox Wants The Spurs… Why? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0)
*  Darren Fox, I was taping a pot on Tuesday with Rosillo and then all of a sudden [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=0.0s)]
*  this trade thing came out and I was like, boy, that's weird. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=4.08s)]
*  And that's like, he has a specific team. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=6.68s)]
*  And then it turns out he wants to go to the Spurs. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=9.32s)]
*  I haven't talked about this on my pod. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=11.6s)]
*  I know you've probably talked about it on your show, Justin. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=13.08s)]
*  I had great career move by Darren Fox trying to go to the Spurs. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=15.68s)]
*  Like this is like trying to join the hit TV show. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=18.76s)]
*  That's going to be the number one show on TV for the next 10 years. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  Like it's, I get why he wants to do it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=25.2s)]
*  It's part, they need somebody like him. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=27.84s)]
*  The question for me is what is the timetable for the Spurs? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=30.8s)]
*  Do you even need to do this now? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=35.4s)]
*  What's the point of it? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=37.16s)]
*  You have no chance to win a title. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=38.16s)]
*  Could you, if he wants to play for you this bad, why not just wait till he's a free agent? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=39.88s)]
*  Why am I giving up stuff for him now? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=43.64s)]
*  He's trying to get out ahead of it, right? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  Because everybody's going to want to go there. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=47.16s)]
*  So it's a smart decision by him if that's what he wants to do. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=48.8s)]
*  Cause Eddie, if Eddie could still play, Eddie would be like, I'm here. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=51.44s)]
*  I'll sit, I'll stand in the corner. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=55.32s)]
*  Every, every single player in the league should want that. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=57.239999999999995s)]
*  All the broadcasters like, you know, us, we should want to go down there and cover [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  them and just like, you know, be there play by play guys, cause it's going to be [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=63.32s)]
*  fun for like 15 years where you get to watch that every single night. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=66.47999999999999s)]
*  So like it's smart by Darren Fox. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=69.84s)]
*  Now the question is, is it smart by San Antonio to go out there and get them? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=71.88s)]
*  I mean, is that like, what is he 27? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=75.72s)]
*  So, uh, by the time when Benyama is ready, you know, he's, and I think when [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  Benyama I guess is ready right now, but I guess the other pieces, cause you need [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=82.84s)]
*  more than just Fox and Benyama. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=85.88000000000001s)]
*  But like, is he even the guy that you think fits in perfectly with him? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=88.56s)]
*  I mean, he shoots in the low thirties in regards to three point percentage. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  Uh, you know, he's not a particularly high level defender. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=96.36s)]
*  He has an impact in winning in Sacramento. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=99.04s)]
*  So I don't know if that's like my first choice, Darren Fox. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=101.4s)]
*  You automatically become a better defender with that dude behind you. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=104.68s)]
*  Oh, of course you would be a good defender with him behind you. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=110.08000000000001s)]
*  I mean, all you gotta do is stay in front of your man. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  And Darren Fox is so good at that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=112.28s)]
*  But here's where the fit is perfect. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=115.28s)]
*  And I brought this up the other day when Fox with Sabonis was really good. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=118.52s)]
*  But the problem is they're both left-handed. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=124.28s)]
*  Now you're coming off that screen with, with, with now when Benyama now he's [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=127.56s)]
*  going off to his right and Darren Fox is to his left, it's a better pass. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=132.64s)]
*  It's an easier fluid pass. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=137.44s)]
*  It's all of that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=139.48s)]
*  And I think Fox is looking at that as well. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=140.84s)]
*  A lot of times he and Sabonis kind of ran into each other a little bit [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=143.76s)]
*  because of that dynamic. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=148.04s)]
*  But now like this dude coming off left and you got to agree, he's one of the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=149.84s)]
*  best guys in the paint in regards to being a guard and now he's got that size [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=153.64s)]
*  to really initiate stuff to. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=159.36s)]
*  I think that's one of the reasons why he's looking at it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=162.08s)]
*  And I think he's the perfect blend for him. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=164.84s)]
*  You know, and I think even Chris Paul at times has a tough time with that in [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=167.52s)]
*  regards to him. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  So, you know, cause Chris is a more like a right-handed guy as well. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=172.72s)]
*  So I think the nuances there, man, is just, it's going to be really good [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=176.6s)]
*  if he's able to get there. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=180.76s)]
*  Plus Fox was, they were two seed two years ago. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=182.2s)]
*  He was the best guy in that team. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=185.32s)]
*  So it's not like he, teams haven't succeeded with them. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=186.84s)]
*  I guess we're the way I'm looking at it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=189.84s)]
*  The risk would be if we don't do this now, what if somebody trumps him? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=192.2s)]
*  What if somebody else trades for him? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=197.56s)]
*  What if we lose this opportunity? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=198.88s)]
*  So then who are the other guys out there? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=200.52s)]
*  Cause they clearly need somebody like this. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=203.16s)]
*  They need somebody give them the car keys, let him run shit. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=205.32000000000002s)]
*  And it's like, you start looking around the week. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=209.52s)]
*  Who else is it? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=211.8s)]
*  Like Garland's not leaving Cleveland. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=212.56s)]
*  Garland was the guy to get last summer and they probably should have tried to [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=214.60000000000002s)]
*  overpower them. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  Do you wait on hope Maxie, hope Philly just goes so far sideways that maybe they [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=219.4s)]
*  would just want a complete rebuild. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=224.76000000000002s)]
*  You go through all the rosters and he's kind of the best fit for what they need. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=226.88s)]
*  And he probably will never leave because he's from Texas. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=232.32000000000002s)]
*  So he wants to be in Texas and he has players on your team that want to be in a [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=235.56s)]
*  certain region, especially if it's San Antonio. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=241.0s)]
*  Why would you leave once you get there? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=243.36s)]
*  I mean, you're going to be winning. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=244.88s)]
*  You're going to be playing on national television every day. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=245.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=247.84s)]
*  Penny Hardaway left, Penny Hardaway and Shaq broke up. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  Safar Marbury left Kevin Garnett. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, that was the worst one. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=254.4s)]
*  I'll never get over that. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=256.36s)]
*  That's right at the beginning of their career. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=258.56s)]
*  Fox is now playing Sacramento who's a bunch of games. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=260.16s)]
*  Then get hooked up to Wemba Nyama. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=263.44s)]
*  Not if he chooses to go there, but you were like rattling off names, Bill. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=265.04s)]
*  Like, Luca's a free agent, what two years. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=269.8s)]
*  All you hear about is Miami. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=272.88s)]
*  Why is it only Miami that can get these guys? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=274.16s)]
*  Oh, key culture. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=276.08s)]
*  Key culture is red hot right now. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=277.16s)]
*  But you know, you hear that name linked to Miami. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=278.92s)]
*  Why can't Luca be linked to playing with Wemba Nyama? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=281.24s)]
*  Does that make that makes it look like a loser? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=283.76s)]
*  Honestly, like he's just going to this is the same thing. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=286.24s)]
*  We'll say we make a rant. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=289.28s)]
*  I know, but they will buy that for eight years. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=290.71999999999997s)]
*  Yama, you need to stop. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=293.64s)]
*  Now he went to Wade was one of the three best players in the league. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=296.08s)]
*  When he went there was the best player on the team until Wade figured it out [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=298.79999999999995s)]
*  and stopped trying to do everything the next year and they want to back the back. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=302.2s)]
*  I dare you even bring that analogy up. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=306.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=309.59999999999997s)]
*  Wade was Wade was probably the third best player in the league. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=310.88s)]
*  And the best player on the second in the 2011 playoffs, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  he was the best part of the team. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=318.68s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=319.88s)]
*  He wasn't chopped liver. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=320.59999999999997s)]
*  He had a check and Jack wasn't chopped liver either. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=321.76s)]
*  Wade don't sniff a finals victory back then if it wasn't for Shaq [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=325.36s)]
*  and Alonzo Mourning. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=329.0s)]
*  So you are. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=329.96s)]
*  I mean, we agree with that. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=330.44s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=332.12s)]
*  But he was still a top five player. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=332.68s)]
*  So if you're San Antonio and you can trade for Fox, keep Castle [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=334.24s)]
*  because Castle is just I'm not even discussing him, not discussing Wemby. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=339.36s)]
*  And you can potentially keep Vasell. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=344.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, then you add Fox and I don't care. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=346.92s)]
*  Take your pick. What picks do you want? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=350.16s)]
*  Like I I would probably do it as long as it wasn't an insane amount of picks. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=352.0s)]
*  I don't know what these things are doing with all the picks. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=357.0s)]
*  And they can get so high and they need to keep them and they can keep them. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=359.2s)]
*  Atlanta, they have Atlanta's pick, right? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=363.0s)]
*  They're doing a draft as well. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=365.0s)]
*  So that's going to get more value because Jalen Johnson's hurt. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=366.40000000000003s)]
*  So yeah, that's even more valuable. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=369.0s)]
*  I really like that Atlanta team, too. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=371.32s)]
*  I thought they were like a six seed kind of range sleeper. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=373.2s)]
*  And then they just can't get healthy. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=376.28s)]
*  I mean, they beat the Celtics twice in Boston. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=378.2s)]
*  They beat Cleveland. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=380.4s)]
*  I get multiple times because Tray's having a great year. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=381.48s)]
*  He was a snub. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=384.4s)]
*  Let's just put it where it is. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=385.48s)]
*  Tray Tray was a snub. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=386.68s)]
*  Tray Young was a snub because the way he's played, he's changed his game. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=388.08s)]
*  He realized he's not Steph. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=392.0s)]
*  He stopped playing like Steph and he started playing like a point guard. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=394.04s)]
*  And he's had a he's had a very good year, man. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=397.72s)]
*  And so I think he's a snub in the East as well. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=400.44s)]
*  So. Is the league more fun? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=403.56s)]
*  If there's a Fox to San Antonio trade this year, I think it is. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=407.8s)]
*  We basically sacrifice Sacramento as a playoff team [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=411.08s)]
*  and replace them with San Antonio, because I think they're all. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=414.32s)]
*  Sacramento. Yeah. If Chris Paul was in the trade. Yeah. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=418.24s)]
*  You think Sacramento could still patch it together? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=423.44s)]
*  They have an older team. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  I think anyway Chris Paul goes, they're in danger. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIqHlek33I0&t=426.2s)]
