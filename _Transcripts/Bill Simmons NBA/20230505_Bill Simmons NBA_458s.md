# Bucks Fire Mike Budenholzer: Who Will Replace Him? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9JXAQpcrXY)
*  Alright, last thing before we go, Coach Bud got fired today.
*  I broke the news to you. You did not notice before the game.
*  I did not notice.
*  I figured this was going to happen.
*  They did the classic hour before a huge Warriors Lakers game, too,
*  where they kind of snuck it out there an hour and a half before whatever.
*  Here's my take. Tell me if you agree.
*  The clock is on now, to be honest, right?
*  Two more years player option the year after.
*  You got to get a high profile coach.
*  You got to figure out what this window is, but you're also trying to impress him.
*  And they have, you know, they traded a bunch of first round picks with a true
*  holiday thing. They have no second round picks left because they traded for the
*  corpse of Jay Crowder.
*  And I don't really know what their moves are unless they, I guess.
*  Middleton ops in and then they try to shop them around, but I don't know who
*  wants Chris Middleton or forty three million dollars.
*  So the move would be, hey, we have this new coach.
*  We have a new imagination. We're reinvigorated.
*  A lot of people are throwing Nick Nurse around for this.
*  I don't see it. I to me, this feels very Frank Bogoli.
*  I think one of the title and 20.
*  Yeah, he's a good coach, really good defensive principles, different voice.
*  That was the one that jumped to mind to anybody else.
*  You were thinking. Nobody immediately.
*  I think. I don't know if it's a matter of offensive creativity.
*  I think Bud was pretty creative on offense.
*  I think some of this stuff is of a new voice is going to be able to come in there
*  and tell Janice, we don't need pull up 19 footers ever again from you.
*  Like you're one of the most devastating pick and roll players in the league
*  when you are setting the screen and rolling hard and finishing.
*  You're one of the most devastating finishers we've ever seen.
*  You routinely shoot in the 70 percent from the paint every year.
*  We'd like to see you add a 14 footer wide open.
*  Be able to make that, of course.
*  But like this idea that you walking into threes and long twos and all of that.
*  Right. You're 28 years old. You've been in the league since 2013.
*  Yeah, I think they need a new voice in there.
*  I don't think Bud could come in there and tell Janice like,
*  cut all of the fat out of the game.
*  Yeah, I have a new idea. Yeah, new idea.
*  Try this. Not going to work.
*  And I think some of the defensively, you know,
*  Vogel was very instrumental in I know you guys discount the 2020 Laker
*  championship, but all year they had the best defense in the league.
*  What's it you guys who who was I lumped into there?
*  Just, you know, people that hate the Lakers.
*  Listen, if I could find an asterisk with the Lakers, I'm going to grab it.
*  I know this.
*  I think Vogel is a very great defensive coach.
*  I think their defense can use some tweaking,
*  even though they were the best defense in the league.
*  We've I think people can now get hit to the idea that regular season
*  defense is not the same as playoff defense.
*  What it takes to win in the playoffs is so much more nuanced
*  and advanced than just saying Brook Lopez, plant your big ass in the paint
*  and never move again.
*  You can't do that in the playoffs.
*  Teams are going to exploit that kind of thing.
*  And I think they got caught out there with that.
*  A lack of variation in what they were doing and a new coach could do that.
*  But Vogel, I like that idea as much as anything,
*  because he's not a sort of ra ra guy.
*  Vogel will never be in a press conference, killing his players
*  the way Nick Nurse did all season long. Right.
*  I don't think you could come into a group that's won championships.
*  I mean, excuse me, one championship and start sort of throwing your weight around.
*  I think he's a sort of easygoing guy and he has the proven track record
*  to coach the hell out of a defense.
*  Turn the prediction camera on, Kyle.
*  Just going to.
*  Going to just throw this out here.
*  Something Wozs said in the pregame show, because he did the coach bud thing.
*  And I don't know why he said this, and I thought it was really curious
*  and there was no follow up question from Malika Andrews.
*  So I have the follow up question now.
*  For some reason, near the end of his report, he said,
*  I think you're something like I think you're going to see the Bucks be really patient.
*  And I think there's a possibility one of the people they're considering.
*  Is coaching in the playoffs right now, and everybody is on the table.
*  And I'm thinking like, well, wait, there's only eight people coaching
*  in the playoffs right now.
*  So does that mean an assistant?
*  Or does that mean a head coach?
*  Like, are they going to hire somebody else's assistant
*  to replace coach Bud?
*  Sounds a little unlikely.
*  So then I went through all the teams.
*  Joe Missoula, I doubt I doubt they're waiting to see what happens with Joe Missoula.
*  Let's cross him off. Yeah.
*  Steve Kerr, no, he's not going to go from Golden State to Milwaukee.
*  No, Darvin Ham just got to the Lakers.
*  He has a contract.
*  Milwaukee alum, though, he's a I know, but what?
*  But he's the Lakers aren't going to get rid of Darvin Ham.
*  That's nuts. Makes no sense. Yeah.
*  Mike Malone and the Nuggets,
*  they're probably going to make the finals and they're the favorites to win.
*  In my mind, it's a cheap thing.
*  And because their executive got poached, so he can't be crossed off.
*  I'm going to do like the Logan Roy.
*  I have crossed him off, but half underlined him. OK.
*  Monty Williams.
*  Was that because he got fired?
*  So that would be Ishby, a new owner syndrome.
*  I can't believe we got swept by Denver.
*  Monty Williams is out and bringing in my own guy.
*  I don't see that one either.
*  Tibbs, though, Eric Spolster is never leaving Miami.
*  No shot. He's just going to take back Raleigh's job.
*  Glenn, Doc Rivers.
*  Went to Marquette.
*  Odds are they probably lose the series.
*  This is why you're better in voice.
*  This is this is why you're the big veteran voice.
*  Wants to win one last coach as as one last title as a coach.
*  Good person to put in front.
*  I don't know that if if he meant a head coach.
*  That was where my mind went.
*  I was like, oh, shit, Doc Rivers, is that possible?
*  Also, there's been so many murmurs and rumors about people being happy.
*  Yeah, not really into him in Philly.
*  Yeah. On the player side.
*  I mean, whatever.
*  Maury, who knows what Darrell's up to these days, right?
*  However, there was especially last season.
*  There was a lot of turmoil around that situation in Philly that at times felt toxic.
*  They offseason he they brought him back.
*  It was sort of kumbaya.
*  They had a really great season and beads winning MVP.
*  So, you know, people have sort of forgotten that.
*  But there was a lot of smoke around Doc Rivers last year.
*  So the idea that he would move on, I think you I think you might be on to something.
*  Or it might be a lead assistant.
*  I don't know. But I thought it was I thought it was peculiar that that was
*  it was like he wanted to get that one out there.
*  So there you go. Maybe that rivers.
