# Will Luka Win a Title, or Was That the Mavs' One Big Chance? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOIeLXRw9n8)
*  All right.
*  One more Mavs thing.
*  Could that have been Dallas is one big chance?
*  Cause you just talked about how good the West was.
*  I'm not really positive what Dallas's move is because they made all their
*  moves, they traded all their assets.
*  So basically their one big move would have to be.
*  And by the way, I would not rule this out because I was really impressed
*  by him in the Dallas games, but could Derek Lively become a guy?
*  I think he's already a guy.
*  No, I'm saying like a guy.
*  Capital, should he become a third star Tyson Chandler who can pass?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Which I think is in play.
*  I just don't know if you're getting that Kyrie season again at the same level.
*  And also like I'd be alarmed that against OKC and against Boston, Kyrie was bad.
*  Kyrie was bad in the Boston games.
*  I thought Kyrie was bad in the series except for game four.
*  They got to the finals.
*  So like there were nights where it was like, I think he was definitely
*  deferential and there might've been nights and he was bad, but like
*  whatever he was doing, it worked.
*  I think he's also broadened out his game to the point.
*  Boston is a bad example.
*  It's a really tough matchup for him and just clearly some kind of mental funk
*  playing in that building that he needs to figure his way through.
*  He's found ways to impact the game without just being the scorer whose turn he,
*  like when the ball comes to him, he takes over.
*  I think he's done well off the ball.
*  I think he's been better as a defender.
*  I think he's been better kind of fitting into a team concept, even around
*  someone like Luca, who can be challenging to play with if you don't know how to do it.
*  So I think even the games where he came up with 12 to 16 points,
*  some of those were really good games.
*  The OKC series especially.
*  That's a perfect example.
*  So I would say, live we make it a jump.
*  That's the one.
*  And then how about Luca being healthier?
*  I don't know.
*  We don't even need to talk about the being in shape thing.
*  He definitely 100% was not healthy in that thing.
*  And I saw him, I saw him in two Quipper games in person.
*  I saw it was at every finals game.
*  That dude was there.
*  He was there.
*  I saw it every finals game.
*  That dude was not healthy.
*  He learned to play at a certain pace and I thought all the shit he took.
*  Yeah, he wasn't good on defense.
*  He's going to take a lot of contact because that's his game.
*  Like every single game he had the Kirk Schilling sock going with the blood coming
*  out of his knee and stuff like that.
*  Like that's his game.
*  And I think also like for a guy like that, I think that it kind of, it's kind of
*  like playing on the edge is what gives him his juice.
*  So it's like, I almost wonder whether or not like, yeah, you know, you have to find
*  your joy playing basketball, but like maybe screaming at refs is what fires him up and
*  keeps him in this psycho zone.
*  Sometimes you got to find your rage playing basketball.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I kind of think that like, if I'm, if I'm Dallas, I'm pretty psyched with how
*  all this played out, you know, like, yeah, you didn't see what happened against
*  Denver, but like I would not.
*  Well, they're going to lose their Jones.
*  Even if they were in for the four or five seed next season, I would still be like,
*  uh, I'm, I'm, I'm keeping my eye on Dallas.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  They've earned that.
*  Especially if Luca comes in 15 pounds lighter and he's like, my knee is now a
*  hundred percent, like that's just going to be a different team.
*  I don't know how they're going to keep Derek Jones.
*  Is he playing the Olympics?
*  Luca, my guess would be, I think he's hurt.
*  Like I actually think he's arthroscopic surgery hurts.
*  He seemed pretty dinged up.
*  Yeah.
*  It wasn't, he wasn't right.
*  You could see it.
*  And I think the Celtics knew that the whole time.
*  And that was one of the reasons they were going at him because you look at the way he
*  would play in the first half versus the second half.
*  He didn't seem like he had his legs in the same way with this three point shot.
*  It's three point shot was bad.
*  There were points in the thunder series where I was like, Luke is dead.
*  Like, he's getting slammed on the ground.
*  He's barely getting up.
*  And then he's like, kind of like limping up the court and then like against,
*  against, uh, the wolves, he looked like fucking Superman.
*  So I don't really know what to say.
*  Tough to gauge in that way.
*  But yeah, I think it is like that too, where you're like, ah, he just
*  blew his knee out and then it's like, oh no, he just falls down.
*  Yeah.
*  Five times.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Lucas six years, 22 conference finals, 2024 finals.
*  This is a really good career.
*  If you said, if I asked you, Lucas is definitely going to win a championship or
*  Luke will never win a championship.
*  Which one would you pick?
*  I think this is now, this is now a get up segment.
*  Yeah, no, we were talking about this on one or the other.
*  We had a one and a half titles for Lucas over under.
*  We did this at group chat live last night.
*  One and a half.
*  And I smashed the under.
*  I would go under.
*  I feel under.
*  I think it's the one.
*  I feel like he feels like the kind of player who will win at some point, who
*  will break through, but might need some things to break his way, even if that's
*  just the conference kind of clearing out for him a little bit over time.
*  Yeah.
*  The best guys ever who didn't win a title, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone.
*  I'm putting Elgin Baylor on there.
*  Even though he got a ring, he retired during that 72 acres thing.
*  I think he counts Ewing, James Harden, Steve Nash, George
*  Gerben, Chris Paul, Stockton, Iverson.
*  See you list all those players.
*  Lucas is better than all those guys.
*  He is a better player.
*  And that's, I love Barkley, but he's Lucas slightly better than Barkley.
*  I'm having a brain aneurysm trying to understand Luca over Iverson right now.
*  Yeah, but I mean, so that's the thing.
*  If he doesn't win a title, he goes in that group and it would feel like
*  he's the best guy in that group.
*  From what we've seen so far.
*  I think that this is a real building block.
*  I think that they are like, okay, you know, conference final finals.
*  It didn't go our way, but that's like a really weird game three away from
*  maybe this being much more competitive.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, and they can build off of that.
*  And I think that they can go into any series pretty much with few exceptions
*  being like, we've got the best guy.
*  I thought their team stunk in the finals for what they were capable of.
*  Like you just go through it.
*  PJ sucked.
*  He couldn't hit a three.
*  Derek Jones couldn't hit a three.
*  Kleba almost looked like his shoulder was broken.
*  Yeah.
*  I think he, he couldn't make anything.
*  Lively sucked in the Boston games.
*  Like he going down the line.
*  Like, and then I thought kid coached a bad series.
*  Like I thought Exum should have played a bunch.
*  We were scared of Exum.
*  It took him a long time to figure out who should be playing in the game.
*  Five.
*  Yeah.
*  He was like grabbing for straws.
*  And on the one hand it's like, Oh, Jay kid, Wiley play a veteran.
*  I figured that it's like, on the other hand, it's you play guys.
*  Yeah.
*  Play Exum.
*  He's tall and athletic and can create and didn't seem scared.
*  It's also like, it's easy to easiest strong.
*  Usually the guy who coaches a good series is the guy who has all the options.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  True.
*  And the Celtics have all the options.
*  It's only like Spoh really that we're like, Oh, he might've gotten his ass kicked,
*  but look at all this stuff he did.
*  You know, it's just like, well, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Where do you have Kyrie overrated, properly rated, underrated?
*  I think we've arrived at properly rated through perhaps rose tinted glasses.
*  Right?
*  Like they think we've.
*  It's a warm and fuzzy moment.
*  Yeah.
*  I think we've arrived at like, we got out of, we got out of this entire finals without
*  a massive controversy and also you seem like you're in a better place and every
*  once in a while you just do something.
*  I've like only seen two dudes do on a basketball court in my life.
*  I think properly rated and I honestly, I think he's been properly rated this whole time.
*  I think we were rightly down on him.
*  I think he has changed a ton of things about how he does his job and what kind of
*  teammate he is and who he is in the ecosystem of a franchise.
*  And those are huge, meaningful things.
*  Several people have brought up the similarities between the Kyrie Luca pairing and the
*  Kyrie LeBron pairing and Cleveland.
*  And it did make me think a little bit about like the player empowerment era or the
*  superstar movement era and the super team era and how infrequently those super teams
*  actually like fit together as pieces.
*  Yeah.
*  Phoenix is a great example of this where it's like, nobody there really knows like
*  what they're supposed to be doing.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And it'll be really interesting to see Bud coaching those guys and whether or not it
*  all clicks together because Bunholzer is a really good coach or if it continues to be
*  like three guys playing completely separate basketball games from one another.
*  But like Kyrie found the partner he needed after years of wandering around looking for
*  it. And it's it'll be interesting to see if it can.
*  When you found Greenwald.
*  That's right.
*  Are you the Kyrie or are you the Luca?
*  Doesn't matter.
*  Yeah, we know.
*  We don't talk about one A1B with the watch.
*  I have Kyrie is overrated.
*  Currently overrated.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  What am I Kyrie Basher?
*  No.
*  You have a history.
*  Yeah.
*  I talked to Jackie McMullen about this, but it was great to see her.
*  And she put it perfectly.
*  The players, the stuff Kyrie does, the players are the most impressed by it because they
*  know how hard it is.
*  So when, and there's a lot of ex players on podcasts, on TV shows, and they all are
*  glass half full completely on Kyrie.
*  Who was it that called him the most?
*  I think LeBron said he's the most skilled player in the history of the game.
*  I think a bunch of people have said that.
*  I think Jeff T. gave him the Conn Smythe Award.
*  A bunch of people say stuff like that though.
*  He's the perk does the whole, he's the most skilled offensive player ever.
*  Kyrie's been 22 points a game in the playoffs for like seven years.
*  Like his last 44 games, he's 22 points a game, he's 45% shooting, but it's always a
*  loud 22.
*  And I thought in this series, like I just thought the Celtics were pretty easily able
*  to control him.
*  Yeah.
*  He took 20 shots a game and he didn't, you know, 19.8 shots a game, 19.8 points a game.
*  And a lot of hero ball stuff, a lot of stuff down the stretch that they were just easily
*  able to stop and make them take bad shots.
*  Game three, Luca fouls out.
*  That was kind of the moment for him.
*  But that was so chaotic.
*  Like I think that was a moment though.
*  It's like, if Kyrie is really the most skilled offensive player ever and as good as
*  everyone says, like, okay, let's see it.
*  This is the time.
*  This is why teams do not build around undersized guards.
*  It's true.
*  I think it's like that moment showed the limitations of his shot making.
*  And so did this really the Celtic series more broadly.
*  Really good when you can kind of put him off to the side playing off of a greater
*  role.
*  But if five guys are like absolutely not, you are not like.
*  Every possession lives and dies on you working a high pick and roll and the way Luca
*  does, your team will fail.
*  And that's like, that's fine.
*  Not many guys can do that.
*  Where'd you have them in top 100?
*  Item 23rd.
*  I think I ended up a little higher than that, but roughly that range.
*  I remember I ended up with him, like Jamal Murray, Dame, like that kind of peer group,
*  which is not a bad place to be.
*  And that's the thing.
*  He's played himself back into that group.
*  But the way people were talking about him, like as an all time incredible, I don't think
*  he's the guy that he was in 16 and 17 anymore.
*  And the stats back it up.
*  He was more explosive.
*  He was a better shooter.
*  He was 27 and 30 plus every playoff game.
*  And he's just not that guy anymore.
*  I mean, who among us is the same guy we were in 26?
*  We've seen some shit though.
*  Fair.
*  But I just was surprised that glass had full with him.
*  Like you don't care about Kyrie either way.
*  Like what did you think agnostically watching it?
*  Yeah, I just, I mean, I think he's capable.
*  Like he's got a lot of like dazzling moments.
*  And I think within the context of that team, like he was very effective.
*  Like there has to be some knock on effect from the way Kyrie chose to play and the way
*  that Gafford and Lively and Washington improved over the course of the playoffs.
*  When it got to the have the two best guys in the series and people were making that
*  point in a real like serious way, like that's why I was like, holy shit.
*  Yeah.
*  What are you guys fucking doing?
*  I think it's fair to be like Kyrie didn't single-handedly beat the Celtics in game three
*  when they came all the way back.
*  Instead of being like, Luca fucked that up by not getting his head on his shoulders.
*  He did.
*  I'm just saying that that was a moment for Kyrie.
*  Okay.
*  That maybe you come through there and you win that game.
*  Yeah.
*  But it was like more of a moment where it was like, hey.
*  But this is a hugely successful playoff run for Luca, even though he's gotten a lot of
*  criticism for Kyrie, even though we've seen some of his limitations.
*  Lively, I think was the other.
*  They clearly have something really special.
*  And he did this in a point where like, wasn't it a mid-season ownership transfer?
*  I mean, like, like the amount of stuff going on behind the scenes.
*  Like it's crazy.
*  I heard some fun stuff about that.
