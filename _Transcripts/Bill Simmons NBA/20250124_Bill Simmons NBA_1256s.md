# What’s Going On With the Celtics? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8)
*  All right, so earlier in the week, I told myself Celtics-Quippers Wednesday night, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=0.0s)]
*  Celtics-Lakers Thursday night, both in LA. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=4.08s)]
*  I'm going to go to both games and then I'm going to come home and I'm going to do a little monologue [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=6.96s)]
*  at the top of the Thursday podcast, no matter what happens. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=11.92s)]
*  My worst case scenario was that the Celtics were going to be alarming in both games [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=14.88s)]
*  and that we're going to have real questions now about what's going on with this team. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=19.44s)]
*  Because it's beyond a funk and it's beyond an on-off button issue. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  There's something a little bit deeper happening and I was fortunate enough to sit pretty close [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=27.92s)]
*  to the core of both games. I was behind the Celtic bench for the Laker game, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=32.0s)]
*  which was just embarrassing and really awful. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=35.84s)]
*  I think we're at the point now where we have to ask ourselves, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=40.400000000000006s)]
*  is this Celtics team just different than it was last season? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=43.44s)]
*  All right, well, what's different about it? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  Let's start with Jalen Brown, who isn't shooting as well as he did last year. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  I'm not going to do the thing where I just read you a bunch of stats. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=55.76s)]
*  You can look up all these stats. He's not shooting as well. Three pointers, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=58.64s)]
*  two pointers. He's clumsy with the ball. He's closer to where he was two years ago [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=62.08s)]
*  than where he was last year, where last year it felt by the end of the season, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=66.88s)]
*  Tatum was 1A and Jalen Brown was 1B. Tatum is clearly better than Brown this season. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=70.64s)]
*  There's no, the 1A, 1B thing is out the window. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=76.08s)]
*  I don't really understand what's happening here. Studying it in person for the last two days, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=80.32s)]
*  he seems jacked. He looks like he's filming Rambo First Blood Part II or Predator with Stallone in [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  the 80s. He's like really jacked to the point that I'm starting to wonder if it's made him [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=91.76s)]
*  a little more stiff and, you know, there was some really weird clipper moments on Wednesday night [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  where they're playing against, you know, the role players and the scrubs and the clippers [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=102.8s)]
*  because the clippers rest to everybody. They're furious with the league that the league rescheduled [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=108.0s)]
*  the fire game and it was six games in nine days. So they're like, we're throwing away the Celtic [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=111.92s)]
*  game. And as soon as they did that, I was like, watch this. I bet they, but they hang around [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  somehow with this Celtics. They were very well coached and they really exploited some of the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=119.84s)]
*  Jalen stuff that's been going on this year. What was fascinating about the clipper game, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  Van Gundy, who's like the defensive coordinator on the clippers, was just devising all these [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=128.88s)]
*  different ways to mess with the Celtics. Just they were trapping Jason Tatum 45 feet from the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=134.4s)]
*  basket as he was trying to do his point forward stuff. They were trying to dive at Jalen's dribble, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=140.88s)]
*  like which a lot of smart teams too. They're also trying to trap him at the end of games and just [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=147.44s)]
*  basically make him make dumb plays, which he was for whatever reason really happy to do in that [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  clipper game. And they were exploiting the fact that this year, unlike last year, you can go buy [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=156.16s)]
*  all the Celtic guys. You saw it in the clipper game with guys like Derek Jones and Kevin Porter [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=163.28s)]
*  was doing it until the Celtics brought in Jayden Springer, the Lakers tonight. How many times did [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=169.44s)]
*  Reeves go by somebody? I mean, the Celtics, one of the things, the best things about them last year [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=174.16s)]
*  was the white holiday combo and the fact that those guys could lock down basically everybody in the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=179.92s)]
*  other team. Tatum as a two-way player, Jalen Brown, whose defense, especially in the playoffs, was [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=184.24s)]
*  great. And this year they don't lock anybody down. Anybody in the league can go by them and get to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=189.28s)]
*  the rim, which goes back to, is this an on-off button issue or is just something different than [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=194.32s)]
*  last year? This is not an old team. These guys are all in their twenties. These guys are all in [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=199.28s)]
*  their prime or about to hit their prime. And it's sloppy stuff that you could blame the fact that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=204.0s)]
*  they had a 100 game season last year, that Tatum played in the playoffs, that white, not in the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=211.28s)]
*  playoffs, in the Olympics, that white holiday were in the Olympics, that Horford's older, that they [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  didn't have poor Zingas for the first two months. There's all these things you can blame. And I'm [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=223.36s)]
*  perfectly fine with doing that. But it doesn't explain why Jalen isn't as good as he was last [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  year. Eye test over and over again, game after game, does not seem like the same guy as he was [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  last year. Why isn't the defense as good as it was last year? Well, you can look at the advanced [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=240.0s)]
*  metrics and it seems fine. Even like the last 19 games, they're 10 and nine. If you look at their [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=244.64s)]
*  net rating on NBA.com for the last 20 games of the season, not counting today at Lakers, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=251.6s)]
*  their second in defensive rating. So there's all these advanced things you can look at and be like, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=257.36s)]
*  no, no, they're fine. But I'm telling you, if you're watching them every night, if you're going to the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=261.04s)]
*  games, they don't really look fine. They don't lock teams down with defense the way they did. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=265.6s)]
*  They're never up 20, 25. Last year they felt like they were up 20 in 75 to 80% of the games. This [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=272.4s)]
*  year that feels like they're down 15, down 10, down 12 in the first half of a lot of these games. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=280.4s)]
*  And if you go back, you think they were 21 and five and now they're 31 and 14. So they're 10 and [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=287.28s)]
*  nine in their last 19. I watched all the games they lost and I went to two of them or went to one of [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=293.52s)]
*  them. The 10 and nine thing starts with the Bulls. They lose because Levine is just the best guy on [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=300.47999999999996s)]
*  the floor. He's 36. He teaches pizza and he plays better than everybody in the Celtics. Fine. That's [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=307.76s)]
*  one game. They lose to the Magic who were missing guys because they couldn't hit threes. They were [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  eight for 33 from threes. And if you watch that game, the Magic just played really hard. They played [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=316.96s)]
*  harder than the Celtics did. And you go, huh, all right. Well, you know, on off switch, fine. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=321.92s)]
*  Sixers Christmas, same thing. Sixers wanted the game more. You chalk that one up. Well, the Sixers, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=328.15999999999997s)]
*  they had all their guys. It was national TV. They have a losing record. They wanted the game more. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=333.03999999999996s)]
*  It was their Superbowl. Chalk that one up. Just making excuses time after time with this. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=336.88s)]
*  Pacers, they win the first game against the Pacers by a million points. And you know, two days later, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=341.76s)]
*  the way this works with these, where you played the team two times in three games, you just know the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=348.32s)]
*  Pacers are going to do better in the second game, which of course they do. But the Celtics shoot [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=352.71999999999997s)]
*  54 threes and they lose. So you leave that game. You're like, too many threes. Didn't go to the basket [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=356.48s)]
*  enough. So again, excuses. OKC was the first sign of like slight alarm because they played [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=361.52s)]
*  really well for three quarters. They were going toe to toe with the team that, you know, they [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=369.2s)]
*  might be seen in the finals, assuming they have a chance to get there. And then Drew Stunk, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=375.44s)]
*  SGA was the best guy in the game. And in the fourth quarter in nut crunch time, which was really good [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=383.59999999999997s)]
*  for the Celtics down the stretch last season, especially in the playoffs, OKC just outplayed [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=389.36s)]
*  them and stole the game from them. Slight sounds of alarm for that one. They have a home no show [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=393.68s)]
*  against the Kings who just changed their coach. Drew and Derek White just looked ancient in that [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=400.72s)]
*  game. Three for twelve. Coming back from a little road trip where they look pretty good. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=406.56s)]
*  Good. Well, let that one slide again. Excuses. They lose to Toronto. Who's not good in Toronto [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=413.76s)]
*  shoots 51 percent and Jaylen's awful is four for 16. Another bad son. They choke against the Atlanta [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=422.88s)]
*  Hawks. And this was Drew. This was one of the worst. This is probably the worst game he played [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=430.56s)]
*  against Boston. They screwed up the game. The game was going to be over. They screwed it up. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=434.4s)]
*  They blow it. Not the kind of thing that was happening last year, though. Fine. And then we [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=439.12s)]
*  go to this L.A. trip in these two games where Clippers game just take care of the game. They're [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=444.24s)]
*  playing all their scrubs in their role players. Just knock them out, knock them out. The last [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=448.8s)]
*  year's team would win the game by 40. This year's team, it's a struggle the whole time. And somehow [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=453.36s)]
*  it goes to overtime. They put miles on Tatum. They put miles on Brown. They put miles on White when [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=458.88s)]
*  they're playing the Lakers the next night who were arrested in a TNT game. So basically they [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=464.88s)]
*  took so much effort to win that Clipper game that now they go into this Lakers game and they're a [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=470.0s)]
*  mess. So back to the Jaylen Brown thing. Last year, Brown and Tatum just had a really good thing going [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=476.32s)]
*  where there was games. If Tatum didn't totally have it, Brown would be able to lift it. And they just [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=484.08s)]
*  had a nice yin yang thing that they just haven't had in the same way this year. And Jaylen's offense [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=488.08s)]
*  has been really rough to watch. I could give you a million stats. You can go look them up. But his [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=494.32s)]
*  two point shooting's way down. His three point shooting's way down. And he's added a couple [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=500.15999999999997s)]
*  things to his game that I just don't love. There's this flat footed fall away he has now at the foul [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=504.8s)]
*  line. I can't stay in that one. Does these weird drives to the basket where he can say, sometimes [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=510.56s)]
*  he'll try to elevate and dunk on guys. Other times he's doing this flat footed, keeping low to the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=516.64s)]
*  ground, scoop into traffic thing that the Quippers were eating up last night. The alarming thing with [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=522.56s)]
*  Brown, back to the Van Gundy thing. So the Celts are up six points, four points, whatever, in the [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=529.28s)]
*  last minute of regulation. And they're trapping the Celtics. They're doing all these things to try to [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=535.76s)]
*  get the Celtics to screw up. And they basically target Jaylen Brown. And there's this one possession [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=540.8s)]
*  where Van Gundy's telling them, because we could see it. We're watching. Van Gundy's running a [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=545.52s)]
*  huddle. It was kind of amazing to watch. And he's telling the guys something. So they come out and [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=552.24s)]
*  the Celtics swing the ball and they swing it. And the Quippers are trying to get them to swing it [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=557.04s)]
*  to Brown. And they do. They trap Brown. He throws it away. Quippers score. Quippers come off and [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=561.6800000000001s)]
*  they're all fired up and they're pointing at Van Gundy. It was like, you told us that was going to [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=567.92s)]
*  happen. And I'm sitting there going, this is a bad sign. If Van Gundy is just reading us, like he's [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=571.44s)]
*  like the defensive coordinator in a football game who knows our plays. Like he's steering us to the [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=577.2s)]
*  play that we don't want to happen. It just wasn't great. They were really, really out coached in [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=581.68s)]
*  that Quipper game, which I did not love. But in general, he just, you know, he'll hit some threes. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=586.16s)]
*  The stats are fine. He can fool you unless you're actually watching game after game. He just hasn't [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=593.76s)]
*  been as good as he, as he was last year. Derek White's another one. Derek White, who the first [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=598.64s)]
*  six weeks of the season, it was like, this guy's going to make the all-star team. This guy is one [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=603.92s)]
*  of the best 30 assets in the league and his three point shooting has dropped by the month, 47% first [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=607.6s)]
*  month, 40%, 35%, 30 this month. The game today, he was like the 19th best player in the game. Obviously [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=613.9200000000001s)]
*  he's not, but he's just not impactful. And then Holliday, who kind of comes and goes and he's [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=620.16s)]
*  older and he's clearly saving himself for the playoffs. First half of the game, nonexistent. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=627.12s)]
*  Second half of the game, they come out, they're pissed against the Lakers and they're now playing [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=632.96s)]
*  defense and Holliday is guarding everybody and has this little five minute stretch that reminded you [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=638.08s)]
*  like, this is why this team's pretty special with Nacon and Liesch Drew is like this defensive weapon [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=644.08s)]
*  Tatum and Brown and poor Zingas with his height. Like they're, this is it. This is the team we're [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=649.9200000000001s)]
*  used to seeing. And then, you know, missed a couple of shots. The Celtics were just so awful [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=654.88s)]
*  tonight. I don't know how many layups they missed, how many shots around the rim, but it felt like [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=659.76s)]
*  it was at least 20. They just couldn't buy a basket. They were just a complete mess. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=664.56s)]
*  So the Brown thing's concerned and the white thing's concerning, Holliday is older. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=670.72s)]
*  I'm going to chalk it up to that. The on off switch thing, understandable. We've seen it happen a [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=675.36s)]
*  bunch of times with teams that won the title. But as we talked about before the season, the pods we've [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=680.64s)]
*  done, it could go one or two ways after you win the title. You either have the on off switch [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=685.84s)]
*  or you have the chip on your shoulder because the bullseye is on you and everybody's coming after [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=690.8000000000001s)]
*  you and you can take that personally and be like, you know what? We're going to kick everybody's [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=694.88s)]
*  asses again. That is not the Celtics team, at least so far. They got out coached in a few games, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=698.24s)]
*  especially recently in the OKC game, the Quipper game last night, which they ended up winning, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=706.24s)]
*  but definitely out coached that one. Lakers game tonight. I don't know what the lineup's [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=710.0s)]
*  but they're playing twin towers. The whole that it's like you're doing the Lakers a favor when [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=715.52s)]
*  you're playing size. We want to, you want to use your athleticism. Last year, one of the reasons [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=719.28s)]
*  they blew them out was they were building everything around their wings tonight. They're, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=723.28s)]
*  you know, they're playing cornet. They're doing wharf it and poor Zingas together. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=727.68s)]
*  They didn't play Jayden Springer at all, even though his defense was so impactful yesterday. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=732.0s)]
*  And I didn't really understand anything they were doing. I wanted them to put Jayden Springer on [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=736.72s)]
*  LeBron or Reeves, try to take those guys out and try to win the game with defense. They did the [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=740.56s)]
*  opposite and the Lakers made everything they took. There is no real roster flexibility for trades. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=744.64s)]
*  Their second apron team, they have a bunch of big contracts and a bunch of small contracts and [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=753.04s)]
*  nothing really in between Springer at 4 million Pritchard at 7 million. They don't, they don't, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=758.0s)]
*  and I don't even know what the move is. Like the move is to hope that the light bulb goes off with [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=762.8s)]
*  these guys because right now it's not going off. I mentioned holiday with the age 43% shooting from [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=767.92s)]
*  three last year, 35% from this year. They're just less special and they have these funk games now [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=773.44s)]
*  that they just weren't having even in the first six weeks of the season. So as I look at the state [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=780.5600000000001s)]
*  of the Celtics conversations I have with my friends, with my dad, with everybody I know who likes the [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=785.7600000000001s)]
*  team, nobody is like, it's fine. It's okay. We're good. Nobody thinks that, but nobody is really in [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=791.5200000000001s)]
*  full panic either. It's more like, no, no, no, it should come back. I'm not sure the defense is [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=801.2s)]
*  going to come back in the way that we really needed to come back unless Jaylen can get back [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=809.12s)]
*  to where he was last year. And that's the guy I'm watching because I feel like Tatum actually made [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=816.6400000000001s)]
*  a slight step up from last year as a two-way guy, as a point forward, as a reliable guy night after [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=822.0s)]
*  night after night. With that said, last night is a really good example of the difference between [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=828.96s)]
*  Jokic, Giannis, SGA, Luka when he's healthy, and then every other really good player in the league, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=836.08s)]
*  including Tatum. Because last night was a night where it's like, you're playing all your role [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=844.4000000000001s)]
*  players and your scrubs. I'm going to have 43. I'm just, I'm going to just ice this game myself. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=847.84s)]
*  This is what SGA does over and over again. SGA had, what did he have, 55 against Utah over and [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=854.4s)]
*  over again. He's just like dusting teams. And Tatum, as good as he is night after night after [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=860.16s)]
*  night, and the best thing about him is how consistent he is as a two-way guy. He's just not [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=866.48s)]
*  a, I'm just going to dust the other team and just get on my back everybody guy. So it's the [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=872.88s)]
*  collective shit that has to make this team special. And if Jaylen's not quite where he was last year, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=878.24s)]
*  if White's not quite where he was last year, if Holladay's a little older, if Horford's a little [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=884.64s)]
*  older, if you're, if you're moving poor Zingus back in, the only guy who's gone up a level is [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=888.72s)]
*  Pritchard. And then on top of it, the league's better. The West is better. OKC is better. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=893.1999999999999s)]
*  Cleveland's better. The Knicks are better. You know, it's just, everybody's deeper. It's a lot [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=900.0s)]
*  harder. You don't have 11 teams tanking yet. And you have nights like you lose to Toronto because, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=906.64s)]
*  you know, you fucked around. So when I think about like the trade deadline coming, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=912.88s)]
*  and also it's not just the trade deadline, but the team is being sold. Like the bids were in today [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=918.8s)]
*  to get through the first round. There's at least five bidders. Everyone's expecting this to go to [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=922.9599999999999s)]
*  six billion. There's some instability within the organization, which is understandable because [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=928.3199999999999s)]
*  they're about to change hands from this great ownership and this great infrastructure they've [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=932.7199999999999s)]
*  had for the last almost 20 plus years to the unknown. So you have an organization that's a [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=937.52s)]
*  little more unstable than it was. You have a team that's not quite as stable as it was. The team I [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=944.48s)]
*  saw tonight against the Lakers, like I think this is the thing that concerns me the most. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=949.92s)]
*  The camaraderie slash connection with the guys doesn't seem the same right now. And it might just [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=957.12s)]
*  be like, oh, they're like an older married couple that, you know, they've done this, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=966.48s)]
*  they've been together, they don't need to do it. But there's a lot of plays where it's just five [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=970.32s)]
*  guys on the court. Like when, you know, they're shooting foul shots. So five guys on the court [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=973.84s)]
*  who just seem like they're not connected in any way. There's plays where like somebody makes a [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=978.48s)]
*  shot and gets fouled and it's going to be a three point play and not all the guys come over and do [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=982.48s)]
*  the fist bump with them. It's little tiny stuff like that. It's the way the bench is reacting [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=986.96s)]
*  to certain things in the game. Not the same as last year. Last year, the bench standing up, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=992.16s)]
*  going nuts. The personality of the team, you could just feel it when you're in the building, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=996.16s)]
*  when you're on TV. You don't feel it in the same way this year. In the Cooper game yesterday, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1001.36s)]
*  Jaden Springer, because he, you know, out of nowhere and everybody likes him and he just had [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1005.92s)]
*  an awesome game. He was great. He swung the game for them. And it really kind of ignited the bench. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1010.56s)]
*  The bench was into it. They were psyched for him. He made a big three in the corner when Hardin was [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1016.56s)]
*  like talking shit to him as he shot it and he made it and he ran off and they were all going nuts. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1020.56s)]
*  And then tonight in this Laker game, it just felt like they all just wanted to go home. So [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1025.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm both concerned and not concerned because I still don't know if there's three teams better [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1030.8s)]
*  than them. I don't think there's three teams more talented than them. And I think they should, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1036.56s)]
*  you know, there's, there's no real reason that I can see that they can't make the finals again, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1042.64s)]
*  but the way this is going, they're not going to have the one seed in the East and they're not [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1047.92s)]
*  going to have, they're not going to have a home court advantage in the finals. If OKC gets in and [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1051.44s)]
*  maybe even a couple other teams, like now you're looking at a situation where maybe even Denver [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1055.92s)]
*  can finish with a better record than them. So this is a question and this is what makes trying to [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1060.4s)]
*  go back to back so great. And we've seen so many teams try to do it and not be able to do it. And [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1066.24s)]
*  there's always reasons for it. You always hit a point like this. We have to look in the mirror [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1071.92s)]
*  and decide, do we really want to defend our title or not? And what I'm seeing lately with the Celtics [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1076.96s)]
*  is a team that seems like a zombie version of itself that doesn't seem to have that same chip [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1082.88s)]
*  on its shoulder. That doesn't seem to be treating a back to back title as a life or death experience [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1089.04s)]
*  for them. They're just, there's too many games now where the other team's playing harder than them [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1095.8400000000001s)]
*  and too many games when they're not solving issues that are pretty obvious as you're watching, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1100.8s)]
*  like tonight. Like just take out Reeves, just play hard defense on Lebron, guard him full court. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1105.6s)]
*  Just make sure you're not giving up open threes to people like Hachimora. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1113.36s)]
*  That's another thing with the Celtics team, the open threes that they're giving up this year, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1118.2399999999998s)]
*  like it makes you want to rip your hair out. So again, it's not even February yet. A million [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1121.6s)]
*  things can change. One thing I'm looking for the rest of the way, and this is what I'll leave you [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1127.1999999999998s)]
*  with is they have to have a win streak at some point. You have to put together three, four weeks [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1132.0s)]
*  of winning basketball night after night after night, where there seems like there's something [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1139.2s)]
*  special about your team. Even Dallas last year, and Dallas was an unexpected party crash that [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1143.6s)]
*  made the finals, but Dallas had this stretch after the All-Star break where for 25 games, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1150.56s)]
*  they just were kicking ass and playing really well. The Celtics have not had a real stretch [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1155.68s)]
*  like that since the start of the season. And as this regular season goes on, they're not going to [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1161.6s)]
*  do that. And this just becomes a night to night, I don't know what I'm getting from these guys situation. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1167.1999999999998s)]
*  It's, I don't think they're going to make finals. So it's not urgent yet, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1175.76s)]
*  but I'm flagging it. I didn't like what I saw the last two nights. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1182.7199999999998s)]
*  One of those two games should have been good. Neither of them were. And honestly, they should [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1187.12s)]
*  have lost both games. So we'll see. This is a nice test for Joe Missoula. This is a nice test for [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1190.56s)]
*  the roster, whether they want to tinker around it, maybe get a little more athletic, especially on [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1196.32s)]
*  the wing. It feels like they're an athletic wing short. And then Jalen Brown is the guy to watch [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1200.32s)]
*  going forward. What are his numbers? What is his impact? Can he be the one B again? Because right [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H9__nVWQw8&t=1206.08s)]
