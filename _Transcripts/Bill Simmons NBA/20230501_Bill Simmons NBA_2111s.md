# The “Best Player in the NBA” Belt Is Up for Grabs | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA)
*  I'm just going backwards from 2022 or 23 to 1971. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=0.0s)]
*  Giannis had it, right? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=6.0s)]
*  Basically for the last four years, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=7.16s)]
*  even though Curry won the title, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=8.44s)]
*  I still feel like people left that season like Curry, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=10.24s)]
*  amazing, one of the best ever. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=14.72s)]
*  But Giannis, if still like, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=16.28s)]
*  if you just gave him 11 crappy teammates, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=18.36s)]
*  he's still probably the best part in league. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=20.68s)]
*  It was one of the two of them. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=21.88s)]
*  It was Kawhi in 2019 had it for a few months. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  LeBron basically had it during those last couple [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=26.32s)]
*  of years from when he won in 2016, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=29.84s)]
*  all the way through that crazy 2018 series. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=32.32s)]
*  Curry had it before for like a year, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=35.48s)]
*  but it was kind of like, it was almost a vacated belt. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=37.28s)]
*  It was like when Roman Reigns got sick, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=39.72s)]
*  it was like, wait, I guess Curry has the belt, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=41.64s)]
*  but are we sure he's the champ? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=43.64s)]
*  Before that it was LeBron. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  Dirk had it for a year in 2011. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=47.6s)]
*  Kobe had it for three to four years. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=50.08s)]
*  Duncan had it for basically the mid 2000s. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=52.68s)]
*  Shaq had it, 00, 01, 02. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=55.84s)]
*  99 was vacant because of the lockout. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=58.4s)]
*  MJ had it those last three years. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  Hakeem for two, MJ for three. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  Magic for four. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=64.92s)]
*  Bird for a bunch of years, like probably four. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=66.67999999999999s)]
*  Moses, he had it for a couple. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=69.72s)]
*  Kareem, then it's like Kareem, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=71.8s)]
*  Walton Kareem going backwards. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=73.2s)]
*  Julius ABA. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=75.12s)]
*  Kareem in the NBA. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=77.28s)]
*  Wilt, 1972 and then Kareem. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=79.72s)]
*  Oh wow, you're giving Wilt a belt touch here? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=82.28s)]
*  Wilt in 72 like demolished everybody in the playoffs. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=84.64s)]
*  So my point is you kind of knew who the guy was [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=87.56s)]
*  and usually it revolved around did you win the title [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  or did you almost win the title? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=95.12s)]
*  And there are some exceptions. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=96.56s)]
*  Like the 2014 playoffs, the Spurs win. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=97.56s)]
*  You're not gonna sit like, oh, Kawhi has the belt now. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=100.2s)]
*  He didn't. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=102.12s)]
*  It was LeBron was still the best player in the league. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  Last year Curry won, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=104.76s)]
*  but I still think there was a really good [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=105.92s)]
*  Curry, Yanis argument. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  Now we go to this year. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=110.28s)]
*  I think whoever is left standing has the belt. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=112.2s)]
*  So I'm gonna give you four candidates [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=115.04s)]
*  and then three honorable mentions. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=118.36000000000001s)]
*  First one, Jokic. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=122.16000000000001s)]
*  So let's talk about him. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=124.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=125.76s)]
*  This is set up for Jokic now. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=127.24000000000001s)]
*  You could say he was the best regular season player [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=129.16s)]
*  of the last three years. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=131.56s)]
*  He's had a couple of playoff moments [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=133.76s)]
*  but nothing like substantial and deep. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=135.28s)]
*  He had a dog shit team last year, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=137.48000000000002s)]
*  really bad luck with the Murray injury. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=139.44s)]
*  But now it's set up. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=142.56s)]
*  They're the one seed. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=143.4s)]
*  They have this Phoenix team that still looks [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=144.24s)]
*  a little discombobulated. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=145.96s)]
*  Chance to play either the Warriors or the Lakers. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=148.08s)]
*  They're gonna have Colm Court at least until the finals [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=150.36s)]
*  if they keep going. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=154.28s)]
*  And Jokic is the day-to-day most impactful [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=155.88s)]
*  offensive player in the league. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  I think we can all agree on that, right? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=159.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=161.44s)]
*  Who puts their imprint day after day offensively. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=162.28s)]
*  Him and Steph are the conversation as far as I'm concerned. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=165.32000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, where you're always, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=168.56s)]
*  you're never gonna veer off course too much [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=170.04000000000002s)]
*  if you have one of those guys. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=172.56s)]
*  So Rob, are you prepared to live in a world [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=173.88s)]
*  where Jokic is the best player in the league in seven weeks? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=175.64s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=179.84s)]
*  I'm also prepared to live in a world [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=180.84s)]
*  where he gets cooked defensively in a way [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  where we can't even really make the argument [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=185.32s)]
*  that convincingly anymore. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  Where the conversation's now off the table. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=188.2s)]
*  It's off the table. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=189.44s)]
*  So, I mean, both of those things can be true, right? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=190.32s)]
*  I think what we saw from the first round [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=192.32s)]
*  as if we needed more proof of it, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=194.51999999999998s)]
*  like he carved the Timberwolves up, right? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=196.88s)]
*  Like pushed all the right buttons, made all the right plays. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=199.72s)]
*  And what we also learned from the first round [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=202.2s)]
*  is this Phoenix defense is pretty carvable at the moment, right? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=203.56s)]
*  Pretty vulnerable. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=207.24s)]
*  There's a lot to exploit. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=208.4s)]
*  I cannot wait to see that matchup, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=209.68s)]
*  but the give and take of that is gonna tell us a lot [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=211.96s)]
*  about where Jokic is in this conversation. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=214.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's gonna have his work cut out for him [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=216.20000000000002s)]
*  between what KD's doing in pick and roll [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=218.12s)]
*  and what Devin Booker's doing right now, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=220.68s)]
*  because Devin Booker looks absolutely unconscious right now. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=222.4s)]
*  And so, yeah, Jokic, I could, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=226.12s)]
*  if Jokic finds a way to get to the finals this year, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=228.0s)]
*  he has as good an argument as anybody has ever had, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=231.2s)]
*  because he's succeeding despite his weaknesses [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=234.88s)]
*  and the competition, because I'm not convinced that anybody [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=238.0s)]
*  but the Warriors is coming out of that Sacramento, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=242.12s)]
*  Memphis Warriors group. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  So he would have to beat... [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=247.4s)]
*  Yeah, Lakers group, excuse me. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=248.84s)]
*  So he would have to beat the Warriors. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=250.44s)]
*  He would have to beat KD, Book, Chris Paul [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=251.96s)]
*  in the second round to get to the finals. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=255.64s)]
*  Yeah, he would solidify his claim, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=257.4s)]
*  and it would show that his defensive shortcomings [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=259.68s)]
*  aren't so great that this team can't overcome it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=262.16s)]
*  That's the thing, right? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=266.08s)]
*  It's not, do you have weaknesses as a player? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=266.92s)]
*  We like to pretend that some of the past grades [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=269.32s)]
*  were perfect and had all watertight all around games. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=271.08s)]
*  It's, do you win anyway? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=274.6s)]
*  Does it matter or can you overcome whatever it is [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=276.0s)]
*  that's holding you back as a player? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=279.44s)]
*  Yeah, every great player has had some form of weakness. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  Giannis didn't really wanna get fouled, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=285.48s)]
*  and Giannis was being left open from 15 feet, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=287.56s)]
*  and he still made it work and won the title. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=290.04s)]
*  Curry had a lot of, oh, Curry's six for 20 right now. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  He'll have those games from time to time. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=296.0s)]
*  Boneheaded turnovers. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=297.72s)]
*  Yeah, he called a timeout with no timeouts left on Sunday. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=299.24s)]
*  None of these guys are perfect, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=302.4s)]
*  and you can pick them apart. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=303.8s)]
*  LeBron invented that whole pick and roll switch, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=304.64s)]
*  hunt the guy, against Steph Curry. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=306.96s)]
*  Those are some of Steph's weaknesses for sure. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=309.24s)]
*  Yeah, and I've made this point before, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=312.04s)]
*  and it sounds like I'm making an excuse for Yocage, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  but his one deficiency is just really glaring. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=315.76s)]
*  It's the equivalent of Giannis just being unable [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=320.52s)]
*  to shoot from 15 feet. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=322.84s)]
*  When Yocage is on an island and somebody goes by him, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=324.44s)]
*  which by the way is pretty much the entire league [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=327.12s)]
*  at this point, it's not like LeBron is locking up people [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=329.28s)]
*  from 25 feet away either, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=332.2s)]
*  but when somebody blows by Yocage, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=333.71999999999997s)]
*  it looks 100 times worse. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=335.71999999999997s)]
*  It's like, oh my God, Yocage, Jesus. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=337.56s)]
*  I never thought his defense was that bad. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=340.8s)]
*  I never thought Curry's defense was that bad either. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=342.59999999999997s)]
*  I actually think Curry's a pretty good defensive player. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=345.16s)]
*  And the thing about Yocage too is that the league [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=347.36s)]
*  is so pick and roll heavy, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=349.76s)]
*  and so when teams want to go after him, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=351.32s)]
*  it's like you're watching it happen, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  play after play after play after play. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=356.12s)]
*  It's like it's slow motion. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=357.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's tough. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=358.64s)]
*  There's a difference between being a target [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=360.16s)]
*  and everyone knowing that you're a target, right? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=361.64s)]
*  It makes a world of difference. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=364.04s)]
*  The other interesting thing about Yocage [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=366.44s)]
*  as just putting the actual crown on [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=367.88s)]
*  as the best guy in the league, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=370.88s)]
*  I don't think anybody has ever cared less, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=373.28s)]
*  that has ever passed through these circles [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=375.56s)]
*  and walked down the tunnel of like, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=378.76s)]
*  I wonder if people will now think [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=380.24s)]
*  I'm the best guy in the league. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=381.52s)]
*  Even Giannis, who I think is among the most [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=382.8s)]
*  authentic stars we have in any sport, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=385.68s)]
*  he cares a little, right? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=390.0s)]
*  He's competitive. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=391.2s)]
*  You always hear him talking about other great players [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=392.03999999999996s)]
*  and things he learns. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=394.08s)]
*  He does care. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=394.92s)]
*  He cares about it. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=395.76s)]
*  And Yocage probably deep down cares, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=396.68s)]
*  but watching him throw away the MVP [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=398.32s)]
*  the last month of the season and just kind of sick aims. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=401.28000000000003s)]
*  And he was not like, oh man, if I can get 50 tonight, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=403.76s)]
*  the conversation will sway back to me. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=407.04s)]
*  He just doesn't care. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=409.08s)]
*  I think he just wants to win. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=410.28000000000003s)]
*  Like he's playing against Rudy and Kat, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=411.52s)]
*  and it doesn't feel personal for him. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=413.4s)]
*  It's like he's just going out and doing his job. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=415.44s)]
*  It doesn't feel as like, you know what? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=419.44s)]
*  People used to compare me to Carl Anthony Townsend. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=420.92s)]
*  I think this guy was better than me. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=423.08s)]
*  I'm gonna kick his butt. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=424.0s)]
*  He's just playing. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=425.2s)]
*  He is going out and kicking those guys' asses, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=426.28000000000003s)]
*  but it doesn't feel personal when he's doing like, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=429.88s)]
*  I remember the game when it was like two years ago, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=433.32s)]
*  Giannis was playing against the Lakers [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=436.04s)]
*  and he kind of had a big play to end the game. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=437.64s)]
*  And he did the crown on his head, right? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=441.04s)]
*  Like that was clearly a shot at LeBron. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=443.08s)]
*  Like I'm taking it personal when I play against you. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=445.56s)]
*  You will never see Yocage do something like that ever. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=448.04s)]
*  Yeah, what would have to happen for Yocage [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=451.24s)]
*  to give himself the crown? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=452.96s)]
*  Would he have to win the triple crown himself? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=454.12s)]
*  Like would he have to go into his second career? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=456.52s)]
*  We might have to see it, you know? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=460.2s)]
*  I feel like the crown would have had to belong [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=461.64s)]
*  to one of these Eastern block guys [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=463.48s)]
*  who he has a personal relationship with, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=465.24s)]
*  and then he would make it personal. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=467.8s)]
*  Yeah, some country versus country thing. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=469.92s)]
*  Or it's like in the in-season tournament, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=471.68s)]
*  if the MVP gets an actual crown, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=473.48s)]
*  he'd be like, ah, fuck, I gotta put this thing on. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=475.4s)]
*  All right, best part championship bout. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=477.4s)]
*  We talked about Yocage. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=480.16s)]
*  Let's talk about Curry. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=481.32s)]
*  So if you're just talking big picture [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=483.8s)]
*  what would be the most to gain [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=486.40000000000003s)]
*  from an actual championship run? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=488.2s)]
*  It's funny, we have a lot of candidates for, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=491.88s)]
*  wow, this would completely change [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=493.8s)]
*  how we think about this person historically. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=495.44s)]
*  Even LeBron, if LeBron got his fifth, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=497.2s)]
*  if LeBron won a title in year 20, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=499.72s)]
*  that's just an amazing monkey wrench [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=501.36s)]
*  for how people discuss his career, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=504.12s)]
*  him versus Jordan, all that stuff. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=506.16s)]
*  You go down the line, it would affect everybody. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=507.32s)]
*  Curry beating LeBron in the Lakers, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=509.8s)]
*  assuming the Lakers win, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=512.28s)]
*  getting through Yocage in the next round. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=513.84s)]
*  Or basically the offensive player [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=515.64s)]
*  that levitates above the sport crown is on the line. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=517.84s)]
*  And then him winning again in the finals. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=520.76s)]
*  Then it's like, now we're talking about him [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=523.52s)]
*  as one of the really great players ever. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=525.12s)]
*  Not like, oh, he's one of the 15, 16 greats. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=527.28s)]
*  Now it'd be like, okay, Curry versus Kobe. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=529.5600000000001s)]
*  Curry is the best player of the century. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=532.72s)]
*  A whole different thing of stuff comes out. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=534.6800000000001s)]
*  Then you think, Rob, about all the weird shit [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=538.28s)]
*  that happened with this team this year [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=540.84s)]
*  and how shitheads like me were doing podcasts [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=542.92s)]
*  less than a week ago about could they get swept [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=547.0s)]
*  in round one by the Kings? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=549.5999999999999s)]
*  And the resolve and the DNA of this team. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=551.5999999999999s)]
*  And a little luck too. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=553.92s)]
*  If that Barnes wide open three goes in, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=555.12s)]
*  they're down three, one, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=556.92s)]
*  I don't know what the series looks like. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=557.8399999999999s)]
*  But not only they write the shit, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=559.56s)]
*  but it feels like he's the safest bet now, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=562.04s)]
*  would you say, for just being awesome in a playoff series? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=565.36s)]
*  I would say he's replaced Giannis, at least for that. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=569.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he's gonna show up for these games. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=572.48s)]
*  And most importantly, his impact on his teammates [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=574.44s)]
*  is gonna show up for these games. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=576.72s)]
*  Like when you look at some of these contests with the Kings, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=578.6400000000001s)]
*  these are close games all throughout. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=581.5600000000001s)]
*  They're kind of give and take. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=583.24s)]
*  But what do the Kings have, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=584.84s)]
*  or what do the Warriors have that the Kings don't? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=586.08s)]
*  And it's championship experience, sure. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=588.0s)]
*  It's like some defensive flexibility. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=589.9200000000001s)]
*  It's all that stuff, but really it's stuff. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=591.5200000000001s)]
*  And it's his shot making and his gravitating, his impact. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=593.5600000000001s)]
*  And there was this play, this clip in game three [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=596.44s)]
*  that made the rounds online. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=599.56s)]
*  Right before halftime of that game, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=601.4s)]
*  Steph missed a shot, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=603.52s)]
*  Looney got the offensive rebound because of course he did, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=604.92s)]
*  kicked it back out to Steph. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=608.3199999999999s)]
*  Steph hits like a back breaking three. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=609.68s)]
*  And someone zoomed in on like every member of the Kings bench [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=611.88s)]
*  when he hits that shot. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=615.28s)]
*  And the sheer look of hopelessness captured on their faces, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=616.8s)]
*  the pure like, what the fuck do we do with this guy energy? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=621.12s)]
*  That happened with the Celtics in game four too, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=625.28s)]
*  it's the same look. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=627.24s)]
*  That's the Steph case, right? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=628.4s)]
*  And there is not a more back breaking play [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=629.72s)]
*  in basketball right now than when Steph misses [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=631.6s)]
*  and gets another shot to reload [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=633.52s)]
*  because you just know how hopeless it is, right? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=635.16s)]
*  You cannot let him miss one shot [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=637.4399999999999s)]
*  and give him another opportunity because he will beat you. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=640.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's why to me, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=642.9599999999999s)]
*  it's gonna be hard to mount a case [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=644.72s)]
*  that's better than Steph's in my humble opinion, right? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=646.76s)]
*  I think there are guys who can get to great levels. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=649.68s)]
*  Like just for instance, Joel Embiid, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=652.4399999999999s)]
*  if he ever plays as good as he does in the regular season [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=653.92s)]
*  in the playoffs for once in his freaking career, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=656.64s)]
*  then you can be like, yo man, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=659.3199999999999s)]
*  this guy might be the best player in the league for real. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=660.48s)]
*  But Steph does that every single playoff. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=663.12s)]
*  And there's what he does to like, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=666.12s)]
*  people are despondent after he makes a big bucket, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=669.12s)]
*  but the panic he induces before the bucket even goes in [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=671.88s)]
*  is just crazy. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=676.4s)]
*  And then somehow at 34 years old, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=677.48s)]
*  he's never been better as a one-on-one player, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=680.08s)]
*  isolation player, where Daveyon Mitchell, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=682.24s)]
*  this guy is a pit bull. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=685.16s)]
*  He's a great at the point of attack defender. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=686.68s)]
*  Steph is blowing by this dude. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=689.4s)]
*  He's finishing better than he ever did. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=691.2s)]
*  It's, yeah, to me, Steph is the guy for me [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=693.44s)]
*  that like when I'm watching him, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=696.76s)]
*  just like there's no way this guy's gonna miss a big shot. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=697.92s)]
*  There's no way he's not gonna make the right pass [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=700.2s)]
*  when they double and triple team him. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=702.16s)]
*  He's just unstoppable. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=703.72s)]
*  Yeah, Russel and I had talked on Sunday [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=705.6s)]
*  about whether Steph is better now [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=707.04s)]
*  than he was during that crazy 2016 run. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=708.48s)]
*  Yeah, the thing that feels just different and better, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=713.16s)]
*  first of all is the legacy of, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=717.72s)]
*  he's put together so many games now [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=720.04s)]
*  that what Rob mentioned about [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=721.88s)]
*  sucking the life out of the other team, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=723.44s)]
*  now there's like a real resume of, oh shit. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=724.8s)]
*  It's like the horror movie. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=728.32s)]
*  It's like when you're watching Scream 6, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=729.44s)]
*  you're like, oh boy, they got a phone call. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=731.12s)]
*  This is gonna go badly. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=734.08s)]
*  And you just kind of know from the other Scream movies. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=735.24s)]
*  The other thing with him that I just don't feel like he had [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=738.76s)]
*  in the same way in 16 was how strong he is [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=741.2s)]
*  when he gets a split step on a guy now [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=743.36s)]
*  and he's riding the guy on his hip [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=745.84s)]
*  and he's just mastered sticking his right arm out [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=747.9200000000001s)]
*  with the ball and bringing it back. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=751.24s)]
*  And it just feels like he only needs an inch now to score. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=752.6800000000001s)]
*  And I don't really remember that in the same way in 2016. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=755.88s)]
*  I almost wanna go back and watch some, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=760.44s)]
*  in 2016 it felt way more jump shoddy, fast break layupy, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=762.08s)]
*  but not like this half court get to the rim stuff. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=766.2s)]
*  You can knock him off his square [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=770.04s)]
*  very easily back in those days. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=772.1999999999999s)]
*  Like easily rattle. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=774.24s)]
*  That was sort of the game plan was to get in his airspace, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=775.3199999999999s)]
*  crowd him, rough him up. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=778.56s)]
*  That was the thing. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=780.1999999999999s)]
*  Rough stuff, hurry up. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=781.02s)]
*  Can't do that anymore. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=782.4399999999999s)]
*  You'll have a, no, these are unmovable now. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=783.28s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=785.68s)]
*  Next guy. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=787.84s)]
*  My third of my four choices. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=790.48s)]
*  I mean, it's on the table for Jimmy Butler, incredibly. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=793.84s)]
*  Right? It is. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=796.68s)]
*  If he rips through the Knicks in round two in New York, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=797.96s)]
*  not having home court advantage in any round, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=803.1600000000001s)]
*  then he goes through, I would assume the Celtics, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=805.8000000000001s)]
*  and Tatum and Brown, the Young Bucks, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=808.48s)]
*  and goes in there and does that. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=810.32s)]
*  And then in the last round, you're getting Jokic, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=812.6800000000001s)]
*  or Curry, or LeBron, or whoever you're gonna throw at him. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=815.48s)]
*  The rant. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=819.24s)]
*  And he just wins four straight rounds [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=820.5600000000001s)]
*  doing this crazy alpha thing. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=822.6s)]
*  We would leave the season the same way [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=825.8000000000001s)]
*  we left with Kauai in 2019. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=827.32s)]
*  Like, hey man, we have a new champ. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=829.2s)]
*  There we go. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=831.84s)]
*  And it's a wrap, right? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=832.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, how are you feeling on Zombie Watch overall, Bill? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=834.2s)]
*  Like, the prospect of the Heat and the Celtics [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=837.44s)]
*  potentially meeting in the conference final. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=839.48s)]
*  Are you boarding up the windows? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=840.96s)]
*  Are you taking stock of the canned goods? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=842.9200000000001s)]
*  Where are you at? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=844.72s)]
*  I am like the old lady in one of those horror movies [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=846.6s)]
*  that is just outside screaming to people on the street [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=850.84s)]
*  that so-and-so's coming and nobody listens. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=853.72s)]
*  That was what I was like for six months. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=856.16s)]
*  Even I gave up though. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=858.4s)]
*  I can't take a full victory lap [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=859.52s)]
*  because after that first playing game, I'm like, I'm out. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=861.2s)]
*  The zombie heater no more. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=864.0s)]
*  Then they lose Hero. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=865.76s)]
*  What's crazy though is, you know, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=867.04s)]
*  they shot 45% from three in the series. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=869.5600000000001s)]
*  That's like zombie heat shit. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=873.04s)]
*  Like when you have Gabe Vincent just pulling up from 28 [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=874.44s)]
*  in crunch time of a game, just burying it. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=877.96s)]
*  Or that playing game four who's a Caleb Martin [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=880.72s)]
*  when he had Giannis on him in the corner. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=883.36s)]
*  And he's like, oh, I can't shoot this. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=885.56s)]
*  Giannis is, no, I'm actually going to shoot it. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=887.04s)]
*  And he just makes it. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=889.12s)]
*  Or you have Kevin Love, who was given up for dead [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=891.0s)]
*  by Cleveland for reasons that remain unclear. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=893.28s)]
*  And now he's putting up a 15-12 in an elimination game. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=895.8s)]
*  That's zombie stuff, Rob. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=899.1999999999999s)]
*  That's where you're like, all right, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=900.52s)]
*  this is just great coaching and a really tough team. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=903.28s)]
*  I thought, Waz, I loved how Bam played yesterday too. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=906.56s)]
*  That was probably one of my favorite Bam performances. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=909.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that adjustment that Spo made [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=912.0799999999999s)]
*  where he's letting Bam orchestrate everything [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=914.2800000000001s)]
*  so that he's taking Lopez out of the paint. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=916.9200000000001s)]
*  And Bam did a couple of things too, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=920.2s)]
*  where he made a couple of jump shots [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=922.2s)]
*  so that when he dribbled towards Lopez, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=924.9200000000001s)]
*  Lopez had to move up. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=927.84s)]
*  He couldn't just stay there, right? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=929.36s)]
*  He couldn't have the confidence [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=930.84s)]
*  that he couldn't make that shot. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=931.9200000000001s)]
*  And so Bam, I think he had something [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=933.5200000000001s)]
*  like nine assists yesterday. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=935.12s)]
*  That was everything for them, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=936.36s)]
*  especially in the fourth and overtime. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=938.88s)]
*  But yeah, Jimmy Butler. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=940.84s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=942.44s)]
*  I'm talking to our guy, Varier, watching this game. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=943.28s)]
*  And I'm like, what the hell are they doing? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=947.1999999999999s)]
*  Why are they still in the dropped coverage? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=949.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=951.3199999999999s)]
*  Justin's like, hey, Bud likes math. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=952.16s)]
*  This guy, Butler shoots at the Mendoza line. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=953.92s)]
*  This is the right call in Bud's mind. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=956.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm like, you can't do this. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=958.6s)]
*  You gotta throw that out the window with Jimmy Butler. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=960.24s)]
*  He shoots threes now. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=963.24s)]
*  Every playoff, he turns into a pull-up assassin. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=964.8399999999999s)]
*  He's in mid-range. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=967.92s)]
*  He's backdoor cutting you to death. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=968.9599999999999s)]
*  You can't stop him from getting to the rack. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=970.88s)]
*  Bro, you have to throw all of your stuff out the window. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=973.5999999999999s)]
*  You gotta treat him like he's KD or something [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=976.28s)]
*  in the playoffs. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=980.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=980.8399999999999s)]
*  But yeah, if he continues to play like this, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=981.68s)]
*  he's playing as good, if not better, than everybody. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=984.16s)]
*  Every single player in the NBA, which is crazy to say. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=987.48s)]
*  And he's one of the two momentum guys in the league now, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=990.76s)]
*  the other being Steph, where I don't know what it is, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=993.48s)]
*  but when he gets going, you can feel it. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=997.8399999999999s)]
*  The other team feels it. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=999.8s)]
*  The audience feels it. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1000.9599999999999s)]
*  I've been in the room when it happens [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1002.1999999999999s)]
*  where you're like, oh no, oh no, uh-oh. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1003.92s)]
*  I don't like the look in his eye. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1007.7199999999999s)]
*  And he just gets going. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1009.4s)]
*  He also missed that three at the end of game seven [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1010.48s)]
*  that he should have taken. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1014.16s)]
*  He missed a three yesterday where it was pretty clear [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1015.04s)]
*  he should have just gone in the basket, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1017.7199999999999s)]
*  but that's part of whatever zone he's in now. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1018.9599999999999s)]
*  He thinks he can make everything. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1021.92s)]
*  He's not afraid of anything. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1023.12s)]
*  And his fearlessness, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1024.96s)]
*  um, would, it's a little reminiscent [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1027.3600000000001s)]
*  of the Kawhi Toronto run for me. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1030.76s)]
*  It doesn't totally make sense, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1033.8400000000001s)]
*  but until somebody beats him, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1035.28s)]
*  I think he has to be in the mix. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1037.52s)]
*  My fourth choice, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1038.8400000000001s)]
*  so I gave you Jokic, I gave you Curry, I gave you Butler. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1042.2s)]
*  My fourth choice might surprise both of you. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1045.16s)]
*  Who do you think it is? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1047.96s)]
*  Just from the setup. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1048.96s)]
*  My fourth choice will surprise both of you. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1049.8s)]
*  Who am I picking for my fourth guy? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1051.72s)]
*  If it's not KD, it's a surprise to me. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1054.44s)]
*  Could it be KD's teammate, Devin Booker? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1059.8400000000001s)]
*  Could you make a Devin Booker case? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1062.8400000000001s)]
*  It is Devin Booker. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1064.68s)]
*  Wow. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1066.0800000000002s)]
*  And it wasn't anything, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1067.04s)]
*  I wasn't fully prepared to go there [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1068.04s)]
*  until I went to the game on Saturday. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1070.0800000000002s)]
*  Russel and I talked about it a little, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1071.92s)]
*  but I'll do it again. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1073.1200000000001s)]
*  Like, I was so impressed by everything. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1073.96s)]
*  I was impressed by how he was carrying, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1077.56s)]
*  there's like a real alpha sense with him now in person. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1079.24s)]
*  The way he carries himself, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1083.04s)]
*  the way his teammates kind of respond to him [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1084.16s)]
*  and play off him, not just during the game, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1086.6000000000001s)]
*  but in the timeouts, like him just screaming [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1088.88s)]
*  at Deandre for 45 seconds. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1091.16s)]
*  How fucking hard he plays. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1093.72s)]
*  That was like as hard as I've seen anybody play in person, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1096.0400000000002s)]
*  except for maybe Giannis in the last couple of years, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1100.52s)]
*  where he was just like balls to the wall the whole time, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1102.92s)]
*  trying his ass off, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1106.3600000000001s)]
*  really pissed when Westbrook would beat him. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1107.3600000000001s)]
*  And offensively, he's got every shot now. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1109.8400000000001s)]
*  And the fact that KD has given him more space, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1112.8s)]
*  I just think like, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1115.96s)]
*  from a two guard total package standpoint [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1117.8s)]
*  of anybody that's been in the league since Jordan, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1120.4s)]
*  from a traditional two guard, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1123.44s)]
*  the kind of two guard we all grew up with [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1124.8400000000001s)]
*  that we're used to seeing, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1126.88s)]
*  he brings the most to the table. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1128.2s)]
*  And I could totally see him [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1130.16s)]
*  putting together three more rounds like that. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1133.04s)]
*  And us being like, wow, Devin Booker's the best player [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1134.88s)]
*  in the league, didn't see that one coming. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1136.96s)]
*  But I'm flagging it now because I do think it's in play. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1138.8400000000001s)]
*  Rob, your thoughts. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1141.92s)]
*  He was, he is on my list too. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1143.64s)]
*  I think in part the idea that [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1145.6000000000001s)]
*  is this kind of the run where he ascends, right? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1147.4s)]
*  Where he hits such a ridiculous level of play, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1149.6000000000001s)]
*  like we've seen already and sustains it [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1152.16s)]
*  to the point that he's kind of undeniable. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1154.96s)]
*  And he made that case against the Clippers. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1157.1200000000001s)]
*  I thought, you know, that was a series where [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1158.7600000000002s)]
*  the Suns had a hard time just getting Durant shots, honestly. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1161.16s)]
*  Like they were trying to get him the ball. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1164.3200000000002s)]
*  He was being pushed off his spots. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1166.0s)]
*  It was hard to make clean catches. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1167.2800000000002s)]
*  And that's part of why, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1169.5200000000002s)]
*  even without Kawhi and Paul George, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1170.36s)]
*  the Clippers were constantly threatening [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1172.36s)]
*  to draw out that series, to make it a slog, to extend it. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1174.1999999999998s)]
*  Devin Booker had other ideas, you know? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1178.56s)]
*  And he, it was just a ruthless, efficient showing. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1180.4799999999998s)]
*  And I can't wait to see how that stacks up [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1184.08s)]
*  against the Nuggets. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1185.6799999999998s)]
*  He also kind of spiritually fits this conversation, right? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1187.04s)]
*  If we're talking about the idea of a belt [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1189.6s)]
*  for the best player, he's going at your best defenders. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1191.24s)]
*  He's going at whoever you throw into him. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1194.7199999999998s)]
*  The relentlessness of that. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1197.04s)]
*  He is going to steal it from you. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1198.32s)]
*  And that's, I think, as much as anything, you know, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1200.3999999999999s)]
*  not only the fact that he is matching Jimmy, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1202.28s)]
*  like almost point for point, really like stat for stat [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1204.84s)]
*  in the playoffs so far, he's logging to our points [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1207.2s)]
*  about his effort, as much total mileage [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1209.72s)]
*  as any player in the playoffs to date, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1212.28s)]
*  he just has the mentality of a guy who could take it. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1214.52s)]
*  And so you have to- [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1217.12s)]
*  And the respect, the respect of the other players too, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1217.96s)]
*  dating back to like when KD was on my podcast in 2017 [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1220.08s)]
*  and identified him, which is another great thing [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1223.56s)]
*  about being the best or one of the best [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1226.04s)]
*  is when the current great guys are like, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1228.2s)]
*  that guy, he's got something a little extra. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1230.3999999999999s)]
*  Waz, where do you stand on Booker? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1232.8s)]
*  I mean, I absolutely love Booker. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1234.28s)]
*  He's blown me away. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1236.92s)]
*  You know, every time Yanis doesn't achieve something, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1238.92s)]
*  I think about the bag talk, how Yanis doesn't have a bag. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1243.8799999999999s)]
*  Devin Booker has five bags. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1248.56s)]
*  He is insane. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1251.32s)]
*  When Rob talks about the distance he's covering, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1253.48s)]
*  he's become a Reggie Miller type, Ray Allen type [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1256.7600000000002s)]
*  off the ball when he's not dominating the ball. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1259.7600000000002s)]
*  And then when he needs to, he's gonna go at you, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1262.48s)]
*  he can go at you in isolation. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1264.7600000000002s)]
*  He's incredible, incredibly crafty at pick and roll. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1266.24s)]
*  Spot up, you cannot leave this man open even for a second. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1270.24s)]
*  It's crazy, the mid range, he's finishing. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1274.2s)]
*  Like he is, it's beautiful to watch. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1276.96s)]
*  It's just KD, you know, he's 6'10", [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1281.52s)]
*  and he's doing all the things that Booker does. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1283.8799999999999s)]
*  So it's like for me, I'm always gonna be like, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1286.12s)]
*  KD, my mind just automatically defaults to KD. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1288.28s)]
*  But what we saw from Booker [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1291.84s)]
*  in the first five games of the playoffs, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1293.72s)]
*  it's up there with anybody. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1297.0s)]
*  I just think, you know, KD has a longer track record [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1298.76s)]
*  of doing it, and you know, it's KD, it's KD. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1302.24s)]
*  Well, we could say Sun TBD for that fourth spot, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1306.96s)]
*  but I think, you know, one good thing with Booker [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1310.44s)]
*  is that Dallas series was so embarrassing last year, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1313.0s)]
*  and he wasn't very good in it either. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1316.04s)]
*  And maybe that's part of, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1318.72s)]
*  he's also at the right time in his career, I think. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1320.6000000000001s)]
*  I think there's still a little chip on the shoulder with him [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1323.3200000000002s)]
*  because he doesn't get discussed with these guys. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1325.3200000000002s)]
*  He got hurt this year, right when he was playing. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1327.04s)]
*  Like he would have been first team all-in-B.A., [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1329.3600000000001s)]
*  no question, if he doesn't get hurt. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1330.8400000000001s)]
*  So it's the right time of career for him. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1333.0800000000002s)]
*  It's chip on the shoulder. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1335.68s)]
*  He's finally got a second guy who can space the floor [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1337.3600000000001s)]
*  for him and help him out a little bit. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1340.4s)]
*  Three more guys we just gotta do quickly. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1343.2s)]
*  Embiid, it is sitting there, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1347.0s)]
*  but I think all of us are dubious. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1349.48s)]
*  He's already hurt. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1351.52s)]
*  Yeah. You gotta show me. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1352.68s)]
*  Otherwise, he doesn't wanna discuss Embiid. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1355.0400000000002s)]
*  No shot. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1356.68s)]
*  Anything to add? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1357.68s)]
*  Because it really does get underrated [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1358.68s)]
*  how much worse Embiid has been in the playoffs [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1361.2800000000002s)]
*  his whole career. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1363.4s)]
*  He's played worse than his regular season output [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1364.76s)]
*  every single playoff his whole career. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1367.88s)]
*  That's what Ben Simmons was kind of trying to get at [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1370.0s)]
*  on our God JJ's podcast. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1372.36s)]
*  Where he's like, you know, everybody's talking about me, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1374.16s)]
*  but like not everybody was just, you know, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1376.0s)]
*  Michael Jordan out there. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1378.08s)]
*  He was basically intimating like, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1379.2s)]
*  it's not as if Joel was world dominating, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1381.24s)]
*  you know, destroyer of everything. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1385.28s)]
*  He wasn't, and he hasn't been. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1387.08s)]
*  Not once. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1389.28s)]
*  Think about, you know, even the Toronto series [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1390.12s)]
*  that points last year, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1392.48s)]
*  a bunch of smart people went into that thinking, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1393.88s)]
*  yo, Toronto can knock these fools off. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1396.16s)]
*  But towards the end of that series, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1398.52s)]
*  it started looking like, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1400.56s)]
*  yo, that was actually kind of possible. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1401.76s)]
*  And so yeah, Joel, I don't know, man. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1404.0s)]
*  He gotta show me for once ever in his career [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1407.04s)]
*  where it's always somebody else's fault. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1410.08s)]
*  There's always some kind of excuse. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1412.0s)]
*  I gotta see it from that dude. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1413.96s)]
*  Yeah, he's shooting 46.7% in the playoffs. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1415.6s)]
*  That first year against Boston in 18, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1420.12s)]
*  which I went to some of those games, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1423.28s)]
*  he just didn't seem like he was in good enough shape yet. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1424.72s)]
*  He could put together like six good minutes, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1426.6s)]
*  but couldn't carry the whole time. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1429.2800000000002s)]
*  2019 was when they lost to Toronto. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1431.4s)]
*  And he was bad in that series. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1434.4s)]
*  I think he shot like 38, 39% in the Toronto series. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1435.68s)]
*  2020, they got swept. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1439.6000000000001s)]
*  2021 was the bubble in the Atlanta series [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1441.76s)]
*  where Ben Simmons, I will not defend Ben Simmons. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1444.48s)]
*  But he wasn't wrong when he pointed out [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1448.3600000000001s)]
*  that Embiid wasn't great in that series. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1451.72s)]
*  Like that still could have been an Embiid, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1453.52s)]
*  throws everyone on his back and does it. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1455.0s)]
*  Last year Embiid got banged up. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1456.96s)]
*  We just haven't seen it yet, Rob. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1458.8000000000002s)]
*  And he's been in the league. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1460.24s)]
*  He was in the 2014 draft. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1461.6000000000001s)]
*  It's 2023. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1463.24s)]
*  We haven't seen it yet. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1464.52s)]
*  We haven't seen it yet. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1466.52s)]
*  I mean, all of those do have their respective asterisks. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1467.48s)]
*  This is honestly one of my all time favorite Woz takes. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1470.76s)]
*  The pro accountability for Joel take is beautiful stuff. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1473.2s)]
*  It is, it is a shift case Woz. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1478.04s)]
*  There is the part of me that wants to go, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1479.76s)]
*  what about the non-Joel minutes though [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1481.8400000000001s)]
*  and how they tank every year? [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1483.72s)]
*  For sure, for sure, for sure. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1485.16s)]
*  Especially against Toronto. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1487.6s)]
*  Like he was the only guy that could defend anything [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1488.8s)]
*  for whatever reason. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1491.6s)]
*  It's fair. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1493.16s)]
*  But there's always a catch, right? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1494.0s)]
*  There is always an injury. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1495.28s)]
*  There's always an illness. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1496.36s)]
*  There's always an explanation. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1497.36s)]
*  At some point you have to do it. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1498.68s)]
*  And I think what's difficult for him in this position [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1500.0s)]
*  already being hurt at this point, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1502.16s)]
*  he's not gonna get the shot that Jimmy Butler did [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1505.2s)]
*  where teams are gonna guard you one on one [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1507.64s)]
*  and make you put up 50 to beat them. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1509.6s)]
*  He's never gonna get that. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1511.8799999999999s)]
*  He's always gonna be double and triple teamed. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1512.96s)]
*  They're always gonna try to make him win [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1515.04s)]
*  with the pass. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1517.36s)]
*  He's gonna have to prove that his gravity is so powerful [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1518.2s)]
*  that he can turn every sixer into a flame thrower. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1521.6s)]
*  I don't know if Philly has that personnel [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1524.56s)]
*  and maybe it's not fair to say like Joel [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1526.36s)]
*  can only get the beat or get the belt [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1527.92s)]
*  if like D'Anthony Melton hits his threes. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1530.24s)]
*  I thought you were comparing him to Hashim to beat. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1532.08s)]
*  I would never, I would never step on your corner Woz. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1534.84s)]
*  I know that's where you're ultimately going [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1537.52s)]
*  in the next segment. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1538.76s)]
*  No, no, no, no, shouts to Hashim though. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1539.6s)]
*  But like, and beat is gonna have to flex on people [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1542.16s)]
*  to secure this kind of standing. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1544.76s)]
*  And I just don't know if he's gonna get [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1547.24s)]
*  that sort of defensive opportunity [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1548.0800000000002s)]
*  with the way people are gonna try to guard him. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1549.6000000000001s)]
*  Six guys tate him and I think it's too early [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1552.52s)]
*  and you felt it in game five. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1554.88s)]
*  Now we're taping this before game six. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1556.8400000000001s)]
*  Maybe he's gonna have 65 points in game six. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1558.6000000000001s)]
*  I doubt it. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1561.44s)]
*  I just don't think from a consistency standpoint, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1563.5s)]
*  from an impact on the game standpoint, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1568.24s)]
*  I look at him versus somebody like Booker. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1570.0400000000002s)]
*  And I know Jason's put up 39 and five all season [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1572.42s)]
*  and he's gotten a lot better in a lot of ways. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1577.16s)]
*  But I still don't trust it on the level [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1578.0s)]
*  of like where Jimmy Butler got to against Milwaukee, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1581.28s)]
*  where Curry can go, where Yokich can go. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1583.52s)]
*  Just game after game after game [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1586.52s)]
*  or even a bad Yokich game is 20, 14 and nine assists. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1588.16s)]
*  That's like the floor for Yokich. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1592.3999999999999s)]
*  The floor for Tatum is a game like game five. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1594.68s)]
*  Yeah, where he's one for 10 from threes [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1598.16s)]
*  and a bunch of layups and no mid range stuff [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1600.24s)]
*  and no real sense for like, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1602.48s)]
*  my team's veering the wrong way. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1604.84s)]
*  I'm gonna get to the line and make some impact plays. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1607.04s)]
*  I still feel like he's putting it together [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1609.32s)]
*  and I don't mean that as a negative. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1612.8s)]
*  I think he's a year to two years away [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1614.6399999999999s)]
*  from really being the guy he's gonna be. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1616.56s)]
*  And I just find it hard to believe [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1618.94s)]
*  we're gonna leave mid June going, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1620.32s)]
*  the best player in the league is now Jason Tatum. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1622.6399999999999s)]
*  It seems early, Rob. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1625.1599999999999s)]
*  Well, do you even leave a lot of Celtics games [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1626.6s)]
*  thinking like the best player on the floor [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1628.9199999999998s)]
*  was Jason Tatum, right? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1630.52s)]
*  A lot of times it's Jalen Brown. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1632.8400000000001s)]
*  I thought Jalen was better than him in the finals last year. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1635.2s)]
*  He's often a reason the Celtics win, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1638.24s)]
*  but there just aren't enough of those unimpeachable, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1640.6000000000001s)]
*  again, Jimmy Butler level performances [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1643.1200000000001s)]
*  where there is clear and convincing evidence [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1645.3600000000001s)]
*  that he is that dude. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1647.3600000000001s)]
*  He's great, he's awesome, he's balanced, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1648.7s)]
*  he does so many things so well. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1650.44s)]
*  But we're talking about the best players in the sport. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1652.24s)]
*  And I think when you stack up these guys [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1654.3s)]
*  one next to the other, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1655.82s)]
*  he's often the one who gets edged out by your Steffs [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1657.38s)]
*  and your Jokic's and your Janic's and even your inbeats. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1660.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think he'd move behind Booker right now, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1663.8799999999999s)]
*  but he can pull himself back. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1666.3999999999999s)]
*  He also was on the best team of all these guys, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1669.12s)]
*  like the best one through nine group, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1671.32s)]
*  which I think is an advantage for him. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1674.56s)]
*  Because if he has an off night, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1675.9199999999998s)]
*  there's four other guys that can step up. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1677.96s)]
*  Like you can have the random Derek White game, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1679.82s)]
*  you can have the Brogdon off the bench for 25 game. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1681.48s)]
*  Like nobody else has that. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1683.8s)]
*  Last guy is LeBron. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1685.3s)]
*  LeBron. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1688.08s)]
*  Current day LeBron? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1689.92s)]
*  Current day LeBron. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1691.44s)]
*  One foot LeBron? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1692.3600000000001s)]
*  One foot LeBron. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1694.04s)]
*  Taking quarters off LeBron. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1696.02s)]
*  There's still an aura about him. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1699.92s)]
*  There's still an effect on the other guys. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1704.88s)]
*  There's still a sense with him that he's gonna come through [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1707.1200000000001s)]
*  when they really need him to come through. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1709.8400000000001s)]
*  It still feels like he can fill the stat line when he wants. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1712.16s)]
*  You watch a game like game five [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1715.72s)]
*  against Memphis last night when, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1718.12s)]
*  he was doing the same thing he did [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1722.4399999999998s)]
*  in the first quarter game four. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1723.6799999999998s)]
*  It was just like, I'm not expending a lot of energy. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1724.6799999999998s)]
*  I'm not sure we can win this game. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1727.4399999999998s)]
*  I'm not gonna, I have seven bullets in my gun. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1728.9199999999998s)]
*  I don't know if I'm shooting a bullet in this game yet. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1732.3s)]
*  I'm gonna see. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1734.8s)]
*  I'm gonna wait, I'm gonna cruise along. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1736.0s)]
*  Do I need to shoot one of my bullets yet? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1738.36s)]
*  And the answer was no in that game. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1741.4399999999998s)]
*  But he was thinking about it. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1743.4399999999998s)]
*  There was in the fourth quarter especially, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1744.56s)]
*  they got within 14 and you could see him like, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1746.1599999999999s)]
*  do I fight, it's like fast and furious. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1749.0s)]
*  Do I hit the nose? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1751.08s)]
*  Do I just save it? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1752.2399999999998s)]
*  And it was clear, it's like, you know what, game six, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1754.04s)]
*  I'll unleash holy hell in that game. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1756.9199999999998s)]
*  In a series, Rob, the reason I think LeBron's [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1758.8s)]
*  in this conversation is you only have to do that four times. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1761.32s)]
*  I only need four monster LeBron games. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1763.84s)]
*  This is kind of what Jimmy Butler has figured out, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1766.28s)]
*  although he played more than 50% in this last game. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1768.12s)]
*  But Jimmy Butler in the Boston series last year, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1770.84s)]
*  he basically played three awesome games, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1772.9599999999998s)]
*  three shit games and one solid game. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1775.32s)]
*  I do think LeBron in a seven game series has four, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1778.44s)]
*  I'm as good as anyone on this court games. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1781.76s)]
*  So that's why he has to be mentioned. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1785.2s)]
*  I don't think he should be in the lead list of candidates, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1787.04s)]
*  but he has to be mentioned. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1789.24s)]
*  So you don't think he should even be in this. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1790.44s)]
*  Look, he deserves mention. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1792.44s)]
*  Like you wouldn't have any all time conversation [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1794.08s)]
*  or like top of the league conversation, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1796.76s)]
*  let's throw his name out there, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1798.08s)]
*  it's a perfectly fair thing to do. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1799.24s)]
*  I'm just watching him like chill 35 feet from the rim. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1801.48s)]
*  He has not put it on tape in the first round. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1804.6s)]
*  He just hasn't. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1807.0s)]
*  He has not put the performance together [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1808.4399999999998s)]
*  to indicate that he's at the level of Devin Booker. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1811.7199999999998s)]
*  You know, it just hasn't happened. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1814.3999999999999s)]
*  Is that intentional though? [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1816.6799999999998s)]
*  Is he just saving it? [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1817.84s)]
*  Because he knows he is, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1820.28s)]
*  he's basically a car that's at 190,000 miles [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1821.6399999999999s)]
*  about to go cross country. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1824.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1826.08s)]
*  Which you're not just hopping in a car and going, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1826.9199999999998s)]
*  you're like, we gotta stop every two hours, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1829.28s)]
*  we gotta get gas, I gotta check the oil, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1831.52s)]
*  anti-freeze is on deck, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1834.3200000000002s)]
*  we gotta make sure the tires are aligned. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1835.76s)]
*  You're really careful going cross country. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1837.6000000000001s)]
*  I think that's what he's doing. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1839.8400000000001s)]
*  But there's a difference between picking your spots [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1841.68s)]
*  and as you're saying, conserving ammo [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1843.64s)]
*  because you know you only have this many, right? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1845.68s)]
*  It's not a matter of like, I need to exert and then rest [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1848.2800000000002s)]
*  and exert and then rest. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1851.44s)]
*  Like Jimmy Butler, what was that, game four, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1852.2800000000002s)]
*  where he just had a massive first quarter, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1854.8000000000002s)]
*  massive fourth quarter. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1856.68s)]
*  Right, he died in between. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1857.72s)]
*  Opening case, closing case, done. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1859.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1861.2s)]
*  LeBron is like, he has to think that way, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1862.04s)]
*  not just within every game, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1863.8799999999999s)]
*  but within whatever the Lakers playoff run is gonna be. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1865.12s)]
*  Like there's just only so much [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1867.8799999999999s)]
*  he's gonna be able to do on that foot. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1869.3999999999999s)]
*  As I said before, the reason why I love sports [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1871.72s)]
*  and why I'm so in love with LeBron's career [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1876.08s)]
*  is that he put off this surgery just so they could do this. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1880.2s)]
*  They could give Memphis a scare, possibly beat them, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1884.8s)]
*  possibly make it to the second round [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1888.0s)]
*  and give whoever a nice one and two. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1890.2s)]
*  He put off this surgery just so he could participate in this [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1893.56s)]
*  at this stage of his career, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1899.1599999999999s)]
*  this type of player that he is at this point, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1902.04s)]
*  just so he could do this. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1904.2s)]
*  That there was a chance that they could get [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1906.36s)]
*  a young Memphis team or Sacramento team in the first round, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1908.2s)]
*  make some noise, you never know, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1911.1599999999999s)]
*  somebody gets injured, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1912.1599999999999s)]
*  That shows you how much LeBron cares about this. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1914.36s)]
*  And it's happening. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1916.92s)]
*  They're on the brink of going to the second round. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1918.76s)]
*  But man, watching him in game five, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1921.8s)]
*  I mentioned this on group chat, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1925.16s)]
*  he drove to the lane, fell on the floor [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1926.52s)]
*  with nobody around him. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1929.56s)]
*  He just fell down. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1931.08s)]
*  Old guy, old guy basketball. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1932.36s)]
*  Well, maybe his championship belt is, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1935.12s)]
*  he's in a different conversation where if they win a title, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1937.44s)]
*  he now gets some real hardware [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1940.8s)]
*  to flash in the Jordan argument. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1942.08s)]
*  It was like, hey, did Jordan win a title in his 20th year? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1943.96s)]
*  I'm one away for Jordan. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1947.24s)]
*  I have the same as Kobe, so he's probably in that one. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1949.0400000000002s)]
*  Last guy, just a bonus I'm throwing out. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1951.3600000000001s)]
*  Mitchell Robinson, three rounds away. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1954.44s)]
*  Is this, Was, is this what Will Chamberlain [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1956.24s)]
*  was like to watch in 1967? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1961.5600000000002s)]
*  So before the series, I'm like, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1964.64s)]
*  the Knicks don't really have a lot of high impact guys. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1967.0800000000002s)]
*  Like the Cavs have Mobley, Mitchell, and Garland. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1970.0400000000002s)]
*  Like these are high impact, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1973.5600000000002s)]
*  you gotta divert extra resources to stopping them. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1974.8000000000002s)]
*  And I'm like, the Knicks, I love Jalen Brunson. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1979.04s)]
*  I think he's gonna be an impact guy, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1980.56s)]
*  but like, Randall's not gonna do anything. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1981.8400000000001s)]
*  RJ's not gonna do anything. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1983.8400000000001s)]
*  They don't have a high impact guy. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1984.96s)]
*  Mitchell Robinson is that person. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1986.68s)]
*  You have to devote multiple resources [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1989.0800000000002s)]
*  to boxing this man out. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1992.28s)]
*  And these dudes would not even look at the rim [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1994.1200000000001s)]
*  when he was down there. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1997.32s)]
*  Like you just don't even think about trying to take a layup, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=1998.76s)]
*  a floater, any of that. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2001.4s)]
*  He's swallowing it up. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2002.72s)]
*  I underestimated and slept on this dude. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2004.2s)]
*  You're right to bring him up in this combo, Bill. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2006.32s)]
*  He might have been first team all NBA center of round one. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2008.76s)]
*  It's him or Jokic. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2013.32s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2014.9199999999998s)]
*  He kind of destroyed Jared Allen. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2016.28s)]
*  I don't know if Jared Allen can come back. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2018.36s)]
*  I try not to overreact to these things. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2021.28s)]
*  You know, like there are ebbs and flows to playoff series. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2023.4399999999998s)]
*  There are bad matchups. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2025.4399999999998s)]
*  Can we look at Jared Allen the same way again [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2027.4399999999998s)]
*  after 18 offensive rebounds over the last two games [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2030.3999999999999s)]
*  after Mitchell Robinson just moving Allen out of the way, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2034.24s)]
*  pulling him down whenever he wanted. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2037.52s)]
*  No, he was like the third Plumlee brother. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2040.44s)]
*  He was Jared Allen Plumlee. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2042.8s)]
*  Well, Mitchell Robinson was all three Plumlee stacked up. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2046.2s)]
*  That's how he'd felt in this series. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2048.68s)]
*  I had an idea that he had it in him for one game [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2050.92s)]
*  because he's done it to the Celtics a couple of times, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2054.76s)]
*  but not where it got to in this Cleveland series [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2056.68s)]
*  where they literally could not keep him away from the rim. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2059.76s)]
*  He was just demolishing. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2062.44s)]
*  It was like watching in high school [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2063.52s)]
*  where the one high school team just has a guy [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2064.88s)]
*  who's bigger than everybody else [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2067.28s)]
*  who just keeps knocking stuff in. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2068.4s)]
*  I was really impressed. Great job by him. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2070.4s)]
*  Can't wait for round two. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2072.0s)]
*  I'm glad we figured this out. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2074.16s)]
*  I feel like we came to some sort of a list. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2075.28s)]
*  We have a nice list of candidates. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2076.76s)]
*  KD probably got overlooked, I think. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2078.56s)]
*  We didn't talk about him enough, but whatever. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2080.6s)]
*  Guys, I don't feel like this podcast was a failure [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2084.52s)]
*  unlike Yanis and the Bucks in my mind. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2087.92s)]
*  He steps toward an even greater podcast [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2091.28s)]
*  and a greater podcast future. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2093.48s)]
*  Success is a mindset. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2095.5600000000004s)]
*  Success was a great job. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2097.0400000000004s)]
*  Good to see you, Bucky. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rot-05XvHA&t=2098.96s)]
