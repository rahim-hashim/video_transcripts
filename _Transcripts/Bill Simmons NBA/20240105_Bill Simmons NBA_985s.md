# What If the Lakers Decide to Trade LeBron? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [January 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g)
*  As we try to figure out, well, what team of Levine go to, who wants him? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=0.0s)]
*  Who wants that contract? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=3.04s)]
*  You're the Lakers. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=4.08s)]
*  Like figure it out. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=4.8s)]
*  He's 28 years old, 40 million a year. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=5.48s)]
*  You're going to be in the tax every year, every way. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=7.84s)]
*  But this leads to my second question, which is a more dramatic question. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=11.08s)]
*  And which is admittedly, um, really just for, for dialogue, for social, just [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=15.08s)]
*  for, as a thought experiment, as a thought bubble, what if they went the other way [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=21.44s)]
*  and, and, and worked with LeBron and, and actually traded him? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=26.04s)]
*  And just said, you know what? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=30.48s)]
*  We don't have it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=31.48s)]
*  We're not good enough. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=32.84s)]
*  You only have four rings. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=34.44s)]
*  We know you want more. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=35.56s)]
*  You're, you have a player option for next year. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=37.56s)]
*  You could go somewhere for four months on a really good team and, and try to, uh, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=39.56s)]
*  try to actually win your fifth title. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=46.2s)]
*  It's not going to happen here. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=48.0s)]
*  We're not good enough. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=48.92s)]
*  I don't think they're at that point yet, but they might be in a month. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=50.28s)]
*  What if there are four games under 500 with no signs of life and can't add [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=52.8s)]
*  anybody and he's like, Jesus, I thought I was going to be [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=56.96s)]
*  going to get to watch my son at USC and be on a top five team. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=59.96s)]
*  And we're a playing team with no real chance. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=63.4s)]
*  Is that even conceivable to you? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=68.6s)]
*  Man, it's, it's hard to wrap my head around bill. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=72.16s)]
*  The moment that LeBron chose the Lakers, however many years ago [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=75.32s)]
*  that was, was that 18? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=78.88s)]
*  Um, 18 summer 18. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=80.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=82.44s)]
*  I thought, all right, that's it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=83.28s)]
*  Like that there's the last chapter, right? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=84.64s)]
*  He goes there. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=86.72s)]
*  Uh, he, he, you know, tries to build on the Laker legacy in his own legacy. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  He, his family loves LA. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=91.96s)]
*  They've already got a home there. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  His media companies, they're all that stuff. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  All these different ways in which it's the perfect place to finish out his career. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=96.56s)]
*  And I've never thought he was going to have another move in him, but listen, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  I mean, you were just talking about, he's, he's no longer at that level of [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=105.92s)]
*  Yokochem bead, uh, Tatum, Luca, whoever, like, okay, he's not a perennial MVP [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=109.24s)]
*  candidate, but I think. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=114.92s)]
*  One of the best 12 guys in the league. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=115.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=117.52s)]
*  He's in our rankings in the top 10 or 12, right. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  In the ringers rankings and he's legitimately there, but he needs [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=120.36s)]
*  more help than he needed before. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=124.36s)]
*  Um, he could still do some damage. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=126.6s)]
*  And so you don't want to waste that. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=129.24s)]
*  He, he's definitely not going to want to waste that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=131.0s)]
*  And I'm sure that the way he has played this season probably encourages him to [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=133.28s)]
*  think, shit, I'm 40, 41, 42. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=136.8s)]
*  I could, I can keep going. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=140.2s)]
*  Um, and maybe it's maybe LA isn't the practical, uh, solution there anymore. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=142.20000000000002s)]
*  So my rule of thumb on this is, is, is simple. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=148.88000000000002s)]
*  If LeBron comes to you and says it's time. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=152.72s)]
*  Cool. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=156.12s)]
*  It's time. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=156.52s)]
*  If LeBron doesn't, I just don't see how you trade it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=157.32000000000002s)]
*  Like you're not just trading LeBron. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=161.36s)]
*  Like you're not just like calling him one day and say, but, uh, pack your [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=163.12s)]
*  bags, we just sent you to Memphis. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=166.0s)]
*  Like it doesn't work that way. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=167.44s)]
*  That'd be amazing if the lakers were like bombshell. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=169.48s)]
*  LeBron's been traded. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=174.48s)]
*  What? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  Could you imagine? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=176.0s)]
*  Um, I have three trades for you and maybe this will make you think differently. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=177.52s)]
*  I have a few that I've come up with, but I don't like any of them, but go ahead. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=181.56s)]
*  Well, I was trying to think it would have to be a team that could say to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=186.04s)]
*  itself, we're adding LeBron. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=189.0s)]
*  We could win the title. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=191.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=193.36s)]
*  So team number one is obviously Philadelphia who has a million expirings. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=194.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=198.84s)]
*  It could go a bunch of ways. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=199.32s)]
*  They could trade. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=200.48s)]
*  Hey, it could be a dump trade for the Lakers where they just get expirings back [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  and whatever picks they have left. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=205.68s)]
*  They could get Tobias Harris and Marcus Morris back and throw somebody [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=207.08s)]
*  Philly's way and get two picks. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=211.96s)]
*  But, um, I did, I did play that one out in my head a little bit. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=213.48s)]
*  Like, okay, now we have added LeBron to Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey with a [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=219.28s)]
*  bunch of wings who can defend with Melton, with Paul Reed coming off the bench [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=225.76s)]
*  with Nick Nurse and LeBron comes in as the Swiss army knife offensive hybrid. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=230.76s)]
*  I was like, I kind of like this idea. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=236.04s)]
*  And then LeBron smartly realizing, Hey, Joel Embiid is really good. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  Those guys are scoring 60 points a game. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  I'm just here to facilitate and be a veteran and, and just do my thing. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=244.68s)]
*  I, nobody fits in. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=249.92s)]
*  I mean, I would say LeBron is one of the four best I can fit in, be a Swiss army [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=251.12s)]
*  knife guy that we've had. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=255.6s)]
*  He's older now, but that one was interesting. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=256.64s)]
*  Does that quote your boat? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=259.52s)]
*  Darrell has chased him like 17 times when he was in Houston. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=261.4s)]
*  Also as a Celtics fan, I'd be like, Holy fucking shit. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=264.36s)]
*  They just got LeBron James. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=267.08s)]
*  That would scare you a little, right? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=268.84s)]
*  Huh? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=270.52s)]
*  That would scare you a little, right? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=271.15999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=272.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=273.44s)]
*  It would scare me a lot. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=273.64s)]
*  I'd like to buy us Harris, but if you could turn him into Tobias Harris and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=275.0s)]
*  an expiring and a pick, that would frighten me. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=278.36s)]
*  I had a list of three teams that I thought were like intriguing, but unlikely [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=282.08s)]
*  just because I don't, I wasn't sure if there was enough coming back and I know [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=286.6s)]
*  you're trading a 39 year old LeBron, so you can't expect, I hate to say it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=290.2s)]
*  You're not getting a Rudy Gobert payout for LeBron. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=294.72s)]
*  That's a really weird fucking sentence to say. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=298.12s)]
*  Um, and with, so with Philly, there's like, there's no young stud. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=300.44s)]
*  You're getting back. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=304.6s)]
*  Their picks aren't great. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=305.28s)]
*  They've got like, there's a OKC Houston Clippers pick that they own. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=306.52s)]
*  It's one of the three in 2026 and then a 2028 Clipper pick. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=310.48s)]
*  Tobias Harris and maybe Milton's. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=315.76s)]
*  It's probably not enough. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=317.56s)]
*  It's probably not enough. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=318.52000000000004s)]
*  It's probably not enough. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=320.28000000000003s)]
*  I thought about Milwaukee as an obvious, like, yes, you want to send them to a [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=321.6s)]
*  contender, but like Milwaukee's got nothing. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=324.56s)]
*  I mean, Middleton has to be in it and they have no other picks. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=327.20000000000005s)]
*  They got nothing. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=329.96000000000004s)]
*  Conaton, Bochamp, Beasley. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=330.64000000000004s)]
*  They got no picks. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=332.52000000000004s)]
*  Like, it just doesn't work. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  Um, the other one I had of the unlikely category in, uh, in the East was the Nicks. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=335.52s)]
*  Um, cause they've got all those picks, but a lot of those picks are really heavily [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=341.4s)]
*  protected. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=345.12s)]
*  They're going to be late first, or they're going to turn to seconds. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=345.64s)]
*  And it's like, it would be like, I don't know, Fournier, Hart, Hart back to LA. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=347.91999999999996s)]
*  Uh, Dante DiVincenzo. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=352.91999999999996s)]
*  You don't think Randall has to be in that? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=354.24s)]
*  Randall probably has to be in it, but if you're the Lakers, are you pairing [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=356.2s)]
*  Randall and Anthony Davis, or is this the first step toward just a complete [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=360.2s)]
*  tear down and Randall is going to be, are you rerouting him? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=363.71999999999997s)]
*  Are you eventually trading Anthony Davis too? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=367.28s)]
*  Like I don't, uh, Randall, Anthony Davis, Austin Reeves team isn't doing anything. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=369.4s)]
*  So you didn't mention the least improbable part of that trade, which would be [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=374.0s)]
*  LeBron and Rich Paul reuniting with Leon Rose and World Wide West. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=377.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to say that's not happening. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=380.68s)]
*  I'm going to go on the record is that will not happen. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=382.68s)]
*  It's a minor, it's a minor snag. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=385.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=386.68s)]
*  That, that is, uh, what was your third team? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=387.08s)]
*  Oh, that was, so that was, those were the three in the unlikely category. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=390.12s)]
*  And then I have, I have two. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=393.04s)]
*  Wait, who's the third one? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=394.12s)]
*  It was Nick's and Philly. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=395.0s)]
*  The Sixers, the Sixers who you'd already mentioned and Milwaukee. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=396.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=398.84000000000003s)]
*  Gotcha. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=399.08000000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=399.52000000000004s)]
*  I had a list of two maybes that I thought were trading. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=400.32s)]
*  Oh, I wonder if they're the same maybes that I had. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=403.32s)]
*  Let's hear them. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=405.20000000000005s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=406.28000000000003s)]
*  Uh, first one's Miami. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=406.84000000000003s)]
*  Oh, that was my first one. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=408.48s)]
*  Uh, the math is tough. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=411.12s)]
*  The math is tough. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=412.76s)]
*  I played with the trade machine. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=413.44s)]
*  It's not that tough. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=414.92s)]
*  Jiro, Jockes, Caleb Martin, Salary Filler and Picks. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=416.24s)]
*  And the, he don't have a lot of picks available. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=421.48s)]
*  I don't think, but they've got, they do have picks available for swaps. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=423.36s)]
*  Like, and again, I don't know how it's hard to set the price for a [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=426.0s)]
*  39 year old LeBron James, right? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=428.92s)]
*  Can I tell you something, Howard Beck? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=431.04s)]
*  I don't think Miami would trade Hockaz for LeBron for anyone. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=433.52s)]
*  Who's not like a top 20 guy. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=438.2s)]
*  I think they're like completely all in 100%. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=439.72s)]
*  Well, I'm saying like a, like not like a rental. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=443.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=446.56s)]
*  I just don't think they would trade Hockaz. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=446.68s)]
*  I think that would have to get like a major guy who's going to be there longterm back. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=448.20000000000005s)]
*  I had a similar one. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=452.76000000000005s)]
*  I had LeBron and Gabe Vincent, ironically going back to Miami for Lowry and Robinson. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=454.44s)]
*  Maybe throw in that Jovich and a future first. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=461.88000000000005s)]
*  So it's a little bit of a salary dump for the Lakers, even though [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=465.32000000000005s)]
*  Robinson's got a pick back or got an extra year and they get a pick out of it [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=468.76000000000005s)]
*  and kind of do right by LeBron. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=473.32000000000005s)]
*  And then there's the symmetry of LeBron going back to Miami 10 years later. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=475.12s)]
*  That's kind of fun. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=478.96s)]
*  They could dust out the old Miami six jerseys. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=480.12s)]
*  I was kind of into that one. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=483.08s)]
*  Cause if they could keep Hockaz and keep Caleb Barton and keep Butler and keep [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=484.16s)]
*  BAM and keep Tyler Hero and then add LeBron to all of that, that becomes, I [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=489.56s)]
*  think a possible favorite in the East. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=495.8s)]
*  I think there's a deal somewhere between mine and yours. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=498.6s)]
*  Like I'm probably overpaying from Miami side or you might be underpaying from [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=500.64s)]
*  Miami side for the Lakers. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=504.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=505.40000000000003s)]
*  Maybe Hero's in that. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=505.44s)]
*  Maybe it's Hero and Robinson. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=506.44s)]
*  But I think, I think like I hear at least one player that you're actually excited [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=507.88s)]
*  about if you're the Lakers has to be in there, somebody who's young and decent. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=512.16s)]
*  So like, I think I feel like Hero has to be in there. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=514.96s)]
*  But maybe you could take Hockaz out. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=517.0s)]
*  So that's maybe Hero and Lowry for LeBron and Gabe Vinson. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=518.08s)]
*  And then there's a Miami pick. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=521.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=523.4s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=523.76s)]
*  It would be the holy shit basketball trade. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=524.88s)]
*  We've had like how many holy shit basketball trades. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=530.12s)]
*  LeBron going back to Miami was not on the big old board. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=532.92s)]
*  It's the thing is this does, this does not feel implausible. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=538.56s)]
*  Does it? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=542.68s)]
*  This one is the first one that doesn't feel impossible. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=543.64s)]
*  What's your other team? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=545.76s)]
*  Let's see if we have the same team. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=546.56s)]
*  This one is like even more like if this were to happen, just like the, the, the [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=550.2399999999999s)]
*  Twitter would break, the universe would break, things would break. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=554.8399999999999s)]
*  Uh, do it on to the Warriors. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=558.04s)]
*  Yo, that was my other team. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=560.3199999999999s)]
*  Uh, again, I don't know if I'm overpaying from the Warrior side. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=563.04s)]
*  Wiggins, Kuminga, Moody, Jerry Pate the second, whatever picks you, you [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=566.7199999999999s)]
*  could put in there if necessary. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=572.04s)]
*  Uh, LeBron and Steph together. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=573.8s)]
*  LeBron finally gets to play with Chris Paul. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=575.64s)]
*  Remember LeBron, the banana boat crew. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=577.4s)]
*  LeBron finally played with Carmelo. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=579.3199999999999s)]
*  He had played with Wade for the four years. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=581.16s)]
*  Chris Paul is the one guy from his banana boat crew that he's never [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=582.5999999999999s)]
*  actually been teammates with. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=586.2399999999999s)]
*  So, uh, if Chris Paul's not in the deal and I'm not putting him in the deal in [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=587.4799999999999s)]
*  my scenario, um, yeah. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=591.44s)]
*  Uh, and, and Draymond who I think if, if you could say what player could we [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=594.1600000000001s)]
*  bring into a Warriors situation, if they keep Draymond that might be able to get [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=599.6800000000001s)]
*  his head on track, LeBron would be the guy, right? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=603.72s)]
*  He, he does, he's very differential to LeBron. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=607.9200000000001s)]
*  I, my version of that trade was Clay. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=610.6s)]
*  Clay's expiring. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=613.2s)]
*  There's no way you can trade Clay, but if you, if you did trade him, trade him to [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=615.6s)]
*  his team that his dad played on the Lakers and you do that, Looney's in there [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=618.68s)]
*  as a big guy and then, uh, and then Kaminga I think is a legitimate piece that, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=623.88s)]
*  you know, if, if you're selling on the Lakers season and you could get Kaminga [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=630.4799999999999s)]
*  as the prize and maybe you re-sign Clay for less, there's, there's something there. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=634.76s)]
*  But if you're the Warriors and you can keep, cause you, you can't use Kaminga [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=640.2399999999999s)]
*  anyway, if you have LeBron, um, and you can keep Brando pods, you can keep Jackson Davis. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=643.76s)]
*  You can keep all the guys you care about are actually helping us here. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=650.1600000000001s)]
*  Plus Curry, plus Chris Paul, plus Draymond. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=652.6s)]
*  Now you have this older veteran team with a couple of young guys. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=655.44s)]
*  That's not nothing. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=657.8000000000001s)]
*  And he's always wanting to play there. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=659.28s)]
*  Like he's, he's the last couple of years, he's sent out some, you know, he's, he went [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=660.48s)]
*  from feuding with, with kind of quiet feuding with Steph Curry to jumping on the [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=665.32s)]
*  bandwagon about three, four years ago, which I thought was notable. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=669.9200000000001s)]
*  And now it's like, you know, chef will be lighting it up and he'll do a chef hat on Twitter. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=672.76s)]
*  It's not inconceivable to me. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=678.4s)]
*  It's, it's, it's not, it's not inconceivable at all. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=680.24s)]
*  I think it would be the painful part for the Lakers would be having to send them right [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=682.6s)]
*  up, you know, the, uh, up the one-on-one up to Northern California. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=686.12s)]
*  Um, not a real rivalry Lakers Warriors, but pseudo and, and you probably want to send [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=690.64s)]
*  LeBron East, but it's also short term, right? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=696.84s)]
*  Like short term ish. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=699.3199999999999s)]
*  Again, I should not say that. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=700.8s)]
*  Who knows when LeBron is finally going to retire or when he'll, he'll, he'll need to. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=702.5600000000001s)]
*  Um, I think it would be tough for the Lakers, but I, I think there's a lot of appeal there. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=706.5200000000001s)]
*  The one piece I would hold off on, um, on yours is, and this is, I admit this, this [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=712.0400000000001s)]
*  is purely sentimental. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=716.9200000000001s)]
*  This is where I let, uh, other things that are not basketball get in the way. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=717.9200000000001s)]
*  I would rather see the Lakers or the Warriors hang on to clay if they can. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=721.5600000000001s)]
*  That's why I put Wiggins in there instead. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=726.0400000000001s)]
*  Um, I think, and especially once- [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=727.9200000000001s)]
*  That's fair. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=730.4000000000001s)]
*  I know. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=730.84s)]
*  And that trade still works. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=731.2s)]
*  You could do Wiggins and Looney and Kaminga. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=732.36s)]
*  You could, you could make the contracts work at that point. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=734.24s)]
*  Yeah, it could still work. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=736.64s)]
*  And then you keep that core together, right? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=738.08s)]
*  If you wanted Steph, Clay and Draymond to go out together and Steph may outlast. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=739.56s)]
*  With Chris Paul. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=744.64s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=746.0s)]
*  That'd be really fun. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=747.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, can I tell you what I think is actually going to happen? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=747.96s)]
*  All right. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=750.2s)]
*  I do have one crazy one. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=750.48s)]
*  Oh, go see it. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=752.68s)]
*  Tell me what you want me to hit this first. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=753.28s)]
*  Cause we got to wrap up soon. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=755.24s)]
*  So tell me what, tell me what you have. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=756.2s)]
*  What if we sent LeBron back to his other former team? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=758.6s)]
*  I thought about that, but they, you know, they are kind of hanging around. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=762.28s)]
*  LeBron for Donavich Mitchell and look, Charis LaVert works salary wise. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=766.44s)]
*  Wow. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=771.8000000000001s)]
*  And then you have, I know they got to get healthy, but Garland, LeBron, Mobley, Jared Allen. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=773.44s)]
*  Um, that's not bad. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=779.48s)]
*  I thought about that, but I, I think if he gets traded, it has to be like, I can win a title, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=780.88s)]
*  but I guess Cleveland's not any further away than Golden State is. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=785.48s)]
*  Is LeBron with Garland, Mobley Allen. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=788.72s)]
*  I know like Garland and Mobley still have some growing up to do, but I'm not saying [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=790.76s)]
*  that that team knocks out Boston and Milwaukee and Philly, but. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=795.08s)]
*  There, I think they're no worse than fourth in the East at that point. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=799.52s)]
*  I tried to talk myself into a Bradley Beale LeBron kind of thing with him going to [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=803.72s)]
*  Phoenix and the trade machine called me a fucking idiot and said, get off the trade [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=807.76s)]
*  machine. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=812.08s)]
*  This has gone too far. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=812.52s)]
*  I had a few of those moments today. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=813.6s)]
*  This is how it's probably going to play out. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=815.4s)]
*  They'll probably get rid of Darwin Ham. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=818.28s)]
*  My biggest fear. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=820.72s)]
*  This is where I, as you know, I'm an only child. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=821.76s)]
*  I'm selfish. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=823.96s)]
*  My biggest fear is they change coaches and all of a sudden Doc Rivers is the Lakers [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=825.0400000000001s)]
*  coach. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=829.28s)]
*  And then I lose Doc Rivers who's been really great on my podcast all season. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=829.6800000000001s)]
*  And I lose Doc and Darwin Ham will not be as good as Doc on the podcast. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=833.32s)]
*  So, uh, that's my scariest thing. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=838.6800000000001s)]
*  The funniest thing would be if they hired Mark Jackson and Mark Jackson was back in [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=841.1999999999999s)]
*  our lives as the new Lakers head coach doing hand down, man down, all that stuff. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=845.04s)]
*  But it doesn't feel great. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=850.56s)]
*  I wouldn't feel awesome if I was Darwin Ham today because, uh, we've, we've, we've [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=852.28s)]
*  seen coaches get fired mid season before on the Bron teams. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=857.6s)]
*  He was, uh, fire, Darwin Ham. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=861.28s)]
*  That phrase was trending on Twitter as of about like 12, 1230 Eastern time today. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=863.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean, he's done a bad job this year. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=868.28s)]
*  There's no question. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=870.04s)]
*  He's it's the rotations have been too weird. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=870.76s)]
*  I I'm always somewhere in the middle on these things, Bill, not always often. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=874.04s)]
*  And this is one of the situations where I am where it's easy to look at the rotations [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=877.64s)]
*  in the lineups and the volatility and all the changes and say he's pushing the wrong [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=883.36s)]
*  buttons and everything. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=886.88s)]
*  But it kind of goes back to the premise that we started with earlier, which is when [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=887.52s)]
*  you have a bunch of guys in your fourth through 10 rings, you're not going to be [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=890.2s)]
*  in your fourth through 10 range, four through 15 range in the rotation or on the roster [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=895.68s)]
*  who all have limitations, obvious limitations, one way, one dimensional, whatever. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=902.1999999999999s)]
*  It's hard to find that. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=907.56s)]
*  And so it may well be that Darwin Ham has not pushed the right buttons. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=908.6s)]
*  It may also well be the fact that Rob Paulink has not given him the right tools to [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=912.88s)]
*  work with, to make that a little bit, uh, more obvious. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=917.88s)]
*  Um, you start hunting and pecking when nothing's working. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=922.6s)]
*  Well, this, this didn't work. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=926.12s)]
*  I tried it for a few games. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=927.24s)]
*  Shit. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=928.32s)]
*  What do I do now? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=928.6800000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=929.2800000000001s)]
*  I, you know, the Angela Russell at the bench, let's he's, he's reaching and he may [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=929.52s)]
*  take the fall for it, but I don't know that it's necessarily should be that much on [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=935.1600000000001s)]
*  him. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=939.2800000000001s)]
*  Um, but I don't know, you know, short of the, the Zach Levine deal or something, I [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=940.1600000000001s)]
*  don't know what, if there's an obvious way forward. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=944.52s)]
*  I mean, my other crazy notion today, as I was kicking around all these thoughts was [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=947.5600000000001s)]
*  like, what if you traded Anthony Davis instead? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=951.12s)]
*  Like there, you know, I, I like, I know that one's crazy, but Anthony Davis could [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=954.16s)]
*  get you back. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=957.76s)]
*  I would say quite a bit. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=958.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=960.24s)]
*  The problem is you're getting, it's a three for one and now you have even more [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=960.52s)]
*  players. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=964.0s)]
*  So you have to figure out what that'll do with. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=964.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=966.8s)]
*  It's probably Zach Levine. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=967.0s)]
*  Maybe Zach Levine's first. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=969.04s)]
*  And then if it still doesn't work, then you think about the coach, but. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz7Hv8mzW1g&t=970.6s)]
