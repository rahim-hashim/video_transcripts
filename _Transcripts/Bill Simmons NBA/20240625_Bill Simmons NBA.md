# Who Would You Trade Straight Up for the Hawks #1 Pick? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7Y-reKoZTY)
*  Atlanta's number one pick. You texted this to me and we thought it'd be a fun segment.
*  Who would you trade straight up for Atlanta's number one pick? It has to be a realistic trade.
*  It has to be a trade that you can make work fairly easily under the salary cap.
*  And it's a specific class of guys, but we did not compare notes. So I'm going to be interested to
*  see if our notes are aligned. What I thought we would do is let's fuck it. We haven't done a
*  draft in like four weeks. Let's do straight up for Atlanta's number one pick draft.
*  What's your favorite? I'll let you go first. What's your favorite name? Give me one.
*  Jalen Brown. Come on. Stop.
*  You're ridiculous.
*  I was very upset about the title of your most recent episode. I was like, when are we getting
*  to the 12 burning off season questions with you, CR Rob? It was a bad title. It was sometimes I have
*  good titles. It's misleading. Yeah, it was a little misleading. I was like, we're on minute 47 at Jalen
*  Brown. Where the fuck are the questions? All right. Aaron Gordon. Aaron Gordon. Wow.
*  Where the fuck are the questions? All right. Aaron Gordon. Aaron Gordon. Wow. Okay.
*  Make the case.
*  Well, his value is less away. Should I say Sanz Jokic? Sanz Jokic. He's two different guys.
*  The funniest thing about him being traded for Orlando is when he was in the trade market,
*  I go, you know, I know what everybody kind of thinks of him, but there's a reason this hasn't
*  really worked out for a while. Then he goes plays in Denver. He's a completely different guy. Then
*  I saw people being like, Orlando, how do you let this guy go? Like, well, just scream. You don't
*  watch them. Just say you don't watch. It's completely different. So Denver probably says no,
*  because it doesn't even make any sense. Right. Unless they wanted to reset the salary. But Gordon
*  just looks a perfect baseline fit for everything they do. So I'm not even saying that I was doing
*  it. I was trying to like, just trying to think of like player value level. Well, you know what I like
*  you know what I like about that? His salary is not that expensive. He's 22.8 next year.
*  So that with that Atlanta's weird team, like they have Capella's expiring at
*  20. So they would be able to just easily make that roster move and add the number one pick
*  to it. And then Denver could flip Capella or it could be Bogdanovich Bogdanovich and number one
*  pick for Gordon, which then seems like too much. I like that one. All right. Here's my first choice.
*  Trey Murphy. And I think the Pell can say no.
*  Unless they wanted Klingon and just said, okay, post-balance Eunice,
*  like we have a better big option, maybe defensively. Well, you do. You just do. I mean, he's a balance
*  Eunice is a bruiser and actually stretches for a little bit, but you could see some stuff in OKC
*  where you thought balance Eunice getting all these rebounds, but Willie Green still wanted to play
*  small with Nance. Yeah. So like, okay, well, what does that tell you? So would you rather have Trey
*  Murphy than any player in this draft? Yeah. See, this is really what the exercise is. Yes. This
*  is why we're doing it. I think I would rather have Trey Murphy than any player in the draft.
*  I love Trey Murphy. Yeah. I'm going to say I'd rather have Trey Murphy just because I can't wait
*  to see what this year looks like Trey Murphy. And that's an easy trade because he's still on a rookie.
*  You know, I mean, he's making like 4 million here. All right, you go.
*  Does Utah say no to Atlanta if they ask for Larry marketing? Yes. It's not. I think you would have
*  to throw in. I think you'd have to throw in Murray with the number one pick to get Utah to
*  even consider that one. I think he's too good. Okay. All right, I'm going to go. Let's stay with
*  the Pelicans. Herb Jones straight up for the number one pick. A little harder because he just signed
*  an extension. Would you rather have Herb Jones than every player in this draft? Yeah, we just have to
*  have fun with it. I love Herb Jones, but I would say based on like the upside part of it,
*  if you just hammered the work a week in and go, Hey, we actually think like,
*  sorry, we think recess. You probably would do it if you were the Pelicans.
*  The reason I, the Pelicans came to mind first is because those two guys together
*  with Zion and with Brandon Ingram and it's just clearly some, now it seems like they're going to
*  trade Brandon Ingram. But it just feels like one of those guys is expendable if they wanted to
*  create a different type of team. Who knows what they do. You go next. You think RJ Barrett would
*  get it done? No, I don't. Atlanta would say, Atlanta would say no. I don't. I think Toronto
*  would have to throw in Grady Dick as well just to even get Atlanta to hang up. He didn't get an
*  all rookie vote. I have a good one. Seruti's going to be mad. I love how stupid this is.
*  It's great. Seruti's going to be mad. Franz Wagner. That's ridiculous. At least with Utah and
*  Lowry, you go, okay, let's just start it. And there's a guy we actually like. Franz is,
*  it's not saying like Franz is so much better than Lowry, but Franz makes so much more sense for
*  what Orlando is doing. Seruti should be upset by that one. I think I agree with you. We're
*  drafting names. You go. I have like five more names just FYI.
*  Mitchell Robinson. Yeah, I think that's a no from Atlanta.
*  It's 50 in a year. I'd just rather take Klingon and get him on a rookie contract for four years
*  and have that. Wouldn't you? Yeah. Look, I'm trying to nail the target here.
*  Kason Wallace. I think OKC would be okay with that.
*  They would trade Kason Wallace for the number one pick in the draft, you think?
*  Yeah, I think they would. I'm 50-50 on it. I think you can make a KC either way. I actually
*  don't think Atlanta would do it because they're like, well, why do we need a guard? We have
*  Trey Young and Murray. You go next. Cam Whitmore.
*  I don't think he's enough. I don't think so. Too small sample size. What about Keegan Murray?
*  I thought of a lot of Kings. Would Sabonis get it done? Would Sacramento say yes?
*  Now the Kings fans are going to be mad at you.
*  Oh, this is all Sabonis is too good for the number one pick. Keegan Murray is right around
*  the right side, but they either signed the extension or he's about to. But the real
*  exercise here is all the players are venturing. Would they go first in the draft? You don't have
*  to worry about the contract yet. I think we're a year away from it, though. Yeah, but it's not.
*  Impending. I only have one more. Does Tyler Hero get it done?
*  He does not. Not after watching what the Celtics did to him in the playoffs.
*  Austin Reeves is a no, but I just wanted to mention him so I didn't feel left out.
*  Wait, so if you were Atlanta and the Lakers offered Reeves, you would say yes.
*  No, I'd say no. I'm saying no. All right. I thought I didn't know if we were getting
*  the no from the Lakers side or not. I subscribe to the Joe House theory in this draft, which is
*  if you're in the top two, you can think it over, think it, do whatever you want. But
*  both of those Yukon guys are going to be, I think, really safe bets to be good,
*  good NBA players at the very least on rookie contracts for the next four years. So unless
*  I can trump that, I'm keeping the pick. I had my favorite fake trade with this pick,
*  or it actually doesn't involve the pick, but involves the Hawks is Bridges with Ben Simmons
*  Sam Howser? No, but, uh, Michael Bridges and Ben Simmons expiring for Trey and Capell is expiring.
*  And then the Hawks take Reed Shepherd with the first pick.
*  It's the most fun version of a Hawks situation. And then they would have Reed,
*  De'Jante Murray that had Michael Bridges that have Hunter. Like I would just like the framework of
*  it better. And then Brooklyn could build around Trey. You've been really good on the Trey
*  destinations for different motivations where Brooklyn it's like, okay, here's your star.
*  Put them on the side of Barclays. Nick's killer Trey Young is here.
*  So you would do that though. You would trade Trey and the pieces it would take for Bridges
*  as those being the two focal points. Yeah. Cause Capella, whatever, he's an expiring and he's
*  probably overpaid as a center at this point. So basically it's, I'm turning Bridges at 25 billion
*  and getting that instead of Trey at 40. And then I'm bringing back Ben Simmons to Atlanta where,
*  you know, his career unraveled, maybe seeing if I can unlock it, bring them back. It's like when
*  the person, the horror movie goes back to the house where all the bad things happen, maybe they
*  can unlock some demons. Jared Allen was the only other name I had. I only had Beale cause it doesn't
*  make any sense for the Atlanta thing, but no, cause Jared Allen's 20 million and Kaminga is
*  8 million. That's another one. I guess you could technically say like would Kaminga go number one
*  in this trap. Well, if we start doing the salary stuff, it's, it makes all of this a lot more
*  challenging. I'm just trying to think of like one GM calls the other. Here's the framework of it.
*  Are you interested who hangs up? And it felt like a lot of these were hangups.
*  The Trey Murphy ones are really interesting. Yeah. I mean, that sounds ridiculous.
*  It feels like Klingons the guy.
*  He makes the most sense if they're not going to blow up their team in any real way. And there
*  hasn't been any real trade buzz yet about either guy. Now they have a semi new regime and maybe
*  some stuff's quiet. We've seen trades happen with no buzz before, but, um,
*  I don't understand if they keep the pick why I wouldn't be clinging.
*  Only that. Well, honestly, from an offensive standpoint, again, I even don't know what the
*  rest of the pieces are going to be here, but I mean, Klingon on Trey lobs, if Trey is still there,
*  it's going to be awesome. Maybe they feel like Klingon as you've had a diminishing Capella
*  Congo who I like, but do they look at Klingon as somebody who's going to be that much better
*  as a security blanket from the blown perimeter stuff that Atlanta is always likely to give up
*  with this current back court? Cause it wasn't like Dejante was locking anybody up either,
*  but do they think Klingon, I mean, Quinn Snyder at one point, I remember it was just an awful
*  Hawks loss. The defense was atrocious. And I, instead of like going to the next game,
*  I go, I'm going to stay here with the Hawks post game presser and Snyder just looked like a defeated
*  man on that night. I'm not saying for like the season, but on that night and it's all out there.
*  You could watch it if you actually care, which I wouldn't expect anybody would care enough to
*  watch it. But he was just like, we are paraphrasing, but we were just so bad at the perimeter. So maybe
*  they look at Klingon saying like, SAR is still so raw. Um, and apparently like SAR, this is the funny
*  thing I think with SAR and the way his guys are handling it, he still hasn't worked out as of today,
*  I believe with Atlanta. And I wonder if they look at it going like, no, we want you to go too,
*  because there's no one else there to take shots. So even if you aren't good, you're going to get two
*  years worth of shots and two years worth of stats and nothing else is going to be in your way.
*  Where Klingon is a better basketball fit and SAR to Washington is a better career fit to get whether
*  you know, look, maybe he will end up being good and all this be justified or maybe he'll just get
*  a bunch of opportunities and put up some stats and make second team all rookie. And we still
*  don't even know if he's any good because there aren't any other options in Washington. Although
*  I still wonder Klingon feels like when you talk to other teams, I hear Klingon at one with Atlanta
*  more than anybody else right now. Okay. Which is not what the mock. And SAR at Washington
*  seems to be consensus at this point, which is crazy.
*  It feels like consensus without any certainty though. Like there's different stuff that you'll
*  hear before the draft with, with lottery guys are like, Hey, who's the most rumored guy to go where
*  or like, what are you hearing the most of? And SAR feels like more of an assumption,
*  just kind of the default guy to go if Klingon goes one where like we read shepherd in Houston,
*  that one feels like there's real momentum. There'll be examples shared where you're like,
*  okay, well that seems very specific where the SAR one never feels specific. It just feels like
*  everybody's just saying the same thing as everybody else. The chalk version of this
*  draft seems to be Klingon SAR shepherd at three, and then the Spurs somehow get Rizoschay at four.
*  Yeah. And I think modest Detroit at five is pretty consistent.
*  But what you just laid out would match, I'd say of all the different things that I've talked with
*  people about, I'll like kind of just, what, what, what names am I hearing at the same spot over and
*  over and over again? And that's how the five played out in most conversations.
*  If I was at Atlanta, I would trade with San Antonio and try to flip spots with them
*  and try to, uh, try to go back from one to four, pick up something extra. It doesn't have to be
*  spectacular. And, um, I feel like I get Klingon at four because I don't think, I don't think two or
*  three has taken him. Houston's going to take shepherd. The Spurs, if they moved up, who do you
*  think is on the Spurs board as the number one guy? If you're trying to build a team around Wemby
*  and you're sitting there going, shit, somebody might take us before, take him before us at four.
*  Should we just move up to one? It won't even cost that much to try to get them because
*  you could say it's, it's getting another French wing. Now they also have a bunch of wings already
*  in their team, but, but Reed Shepherd and you laid out the case for him last week is the, by far the
*  most fun fit next to Wemby for a variety of reasons. And part of me wonders, would they just trade up
*  because everybody thinks Houston like shepherd at three, maybe, maybe a trade up from four to one,
*  give up something extra, not number eight, but some, one of those other picks they have and just
*  grab shepherd at one. So who's on their board? You think it feels like Reese? Yeah. But then
*  sometimes I watch him and I think salon might be as good as he is. I've, I've done a double
*  zag on a Reese. Now I'm kind of back in on him a little bit. All right. He's like, he's six,
*  10. I like his stroke. He's athletic. I like some of his fist pumps on the YouTube clip. I mean,
*  I can't tell you how great fist stroke general of a draft fan I've been this year. I'm not going to
*  pretend to be an expert. Just like I test stuff. I'm watching. I'm like, ah, this kid, I could see it.
*  But I think this whole point of this draft in the top five is anybody who's like, I am positive,
*  a hundred percent. This guy is going to be this. Like, this is not the draft for that. There's a
*  lot of like, I can see it. Yeah, maybe it's like, it's that. So it's like, whatever your yeah, maybe
*  however strongly feel about the, yeah, maybe that's maybe you should take.
*  Sorry for me is like smoking cigarettes. Like if I don't have anything to do,
*  I'll just be like, let me watch some, sorry. I go, let's go. Go another time. I keep waiting to see
*  something else. And that's the lesson is that this is what it is. This is what it is. And for a guy,
*  his size to carry it as well as he does and his end to end stuff, like he had a turnover,
*  somebody block his shot. The ball was turned over. He grabbed it in the paint and he went coast to
*  coast. He crossed over a guy at half court. He had an and one in the paint and you're just like,
*  Jesus, the pick and pop stuff, the shot out of his hands. Like it looks, there's a lot there,
*  but there's also, Wiseman will always haunt me. And that as I watched him, I go, the best stuff is
*  right. The best stuff is really, really good. But you know, right here, when he has no instincts
*  and it's not fluid and he's thinking about what he's supposed to do, it looks awful.
*  And this is what big guy busts look like. And I went out, we'll just go with, we'll go with that.
*  He's so young and we only get to see the three games. And it was a massive whiff. So when I look
*  at SAR, I know why you could fall in love with them, but I kept hoping to see like something
*  else or something else. Like when I go, no, this is the whole point. This is the whole point of
*  this year. I want to ask you a question. Last thing on big guys, they're so hard when the case
*  is always like, oh man, he's only 19. That's what I fell for with Wiseman. Oh man. Imagine
*  four years from now. And you just don't know. Like sometimes they're just big and raw and athletic
*  at 19 and then they're 22 and guess what? They still are big and raw and athletic and they don't
*  have real basketball instincts. So I've just like given up. To me, it's like quarterbacks trying
*  to figure out like Michael Pennex. Sure. Maybe. You know, centers are too hard.
*  Yeah. I mean, Wiseman, when he wasn't thinking, like there would be possessions where he'd get
*  the ball and he would just instinctively go into this amazing like jump shot. Like he, he jab,
*  dribble you and then go up with it. And I was like, what is this? Like this isn't it looks so good
*  out of his hands. And I went, okay, this is like the best version of this is all of these things.
*  But again, if it doesn't get any better, you're right about the quarterback thing. But I was
*  thinking about that with Brady's interview with Colin Cowherd. So Cowherd, which I could tell what
*  Cowherd was doing. He was trying to try to get Brady to share some of those moments with
*  Belichick where you'd be butting heads that we've all read about. Okay. And Brady, because he'd been
*  doing this such a long time, completely flips it and talks about how great Belichick was on a
*  Saturday. All right. And Brady continues to give this awesome answer. And by the way, like all the
*  stuff that we've seen with Greg Olson and how Brady's been and how like this is such a weird
*  situation because Olson's like the best doing it. And now he's going to get replaced. I didn't know
*  if Brady was just the star attraction that networks absolutely love and love bringing up to up fronts.
*  And it's like we've got Brady, we don't even care what the fucking number is. But some of the stuff
*  that Brady's doing is he's sharing these stories in the media. I'm like, he might actually like,
*  this guy might be awesome at this. So we'll see. But are you on Brady's actually going to be good
*  on TV Island? Because I was looking at, I was on Redfin the other day looking at houses. I agree
*  with you. He's way more candid than I was ever expecting. I think he might be awesome. Okay. He
*  was so good with Calhurt. So back to the evaluation thing. And it dawned on me listening to his
*  answer. I've already talked about this because I talk about quarterback evaluation too much on my
*  podcast. But Brady then goes further and at depth. He goes, what I liked about Saturdays is like we'd
*  install. Okay. And there's a hundred play calls and there's all these different things and be like,
*  okay, well this play, no matter what happens, like if they bring a safety down, then we're done. And
*  he goes, and a lot of coaches should just be like, Hey, tip your cap to them. They want, and he's
*  like, I would never want to give it away. So I'd be like, no, we need a call. We needed to say grape
*  or whatever. And he'd be sharing all these things. He's like, once we see this and we would do the
*  install and the walkthrough and all the different things, like if that's something that we're seeing
*  that they do, they can blow up this one play call that we have designed for this Sunday. Why are we
*  going to let them get one? Why are we giving one away just based on the look that we don't have any
*  kind of counter for? So I want to count. That is the quarterback position. And we never talk about
*  that ever. When we're talking about quarterbacks being drafted one, because we don't have access
*  to understanding how these kids operate, or if this is even something they're capable of,
*  or they've ever been questioned with, but we spend all this time talking about quarterbacks
*  and evaluation when really all the things that we're prioritizing have nothing to do with the guys
*  that are actually successful on Sundays. And Brady like share with us another example of why he's
*  the greatest and what the great ones do in their preparation, recognition, all these different things.
*  And we're still, we're still sitting here in 2024 talking about fucking arm strength,
*  charisma, intelligence, and competitiveness. Those three traits. That's it. Do you have those three
*  and you're physically good? You don't have to be great. You'd be physically good. But if you have
*  those other three and that's, that's what it is over and over again. I feel like we're starting
*  to figure out quarterbacks more and more as it goes, because we've been spent so much time talking
*  about it. I still don't feel that confident about it. When we get to like that PENX, bow,
*  next level, I'm just like, but like, you know, Joe burrow, that was a pretty safe bet. The stuff
*  you read about my homes after the fact, it was like, this guy's fucking, fucking animal, you know,
*  but it's more of, but it's, it's knowing the person, you know, there's this joke about how
*  like banking is infested with lacrosse players and it's like, well, one of the things that
*  people want finance is guys that are like insanely competitive. Yeah. I've got some lacrosse buddies
*  that I would not say were super dialed in throughout the entire season, but there were others that were
*  just maniacs. And I'd be like, do you know, there's no league after this really? Like I know there's
*  like two, but there's not, especially back when I was, I'm not talking about like the league options
*  now for cross, but there's something to the now in basketball. No one is tasked with the quarterback
*  job. I don't know that even the best basketball players have to dissect what a quarterback has
*  to do so we can still go back to physical traits. And there's just different guys.
*  No, but I think the point guard position, I think resembles it a little bit. Like when you can see
*  how somebody, the, the way they can lead a team and understand the rhythm of a game, I think is
*  something you could see at the college level. When I look at centers and the reason I like
*  clinging, I don't know. I don't know if he'll ever make it all start to him, but he does two things
*  that are no work in the NBA. He protects the rim and he can, he can dunk those lab passes. We know
*  that works. He's really good at both of those things. So for me, the room for error with him
*  is the slimmest. Whereas I look at SAR and I'm like, man, we've seen that field before,
*  but we've also been wrong on those guys, right? Like, could he be Serge Ibaka?
*  Is that possible? Could he be like a, a, a better rebounding version of Serge Ibaka?
*  I don't know. He'll spread the floor like Serge eventually did.
*  But we didn't know Serge was going to shoot threes when he came in the league. He was just like this
*  kind of runner dunker guy. I didn't think Rudy could walk when he got drafted. Okay. Right. Clint
*  Capella. I was like, I don't know. Like, I don't know what this is. And it's also for some of these
*  bigs, especially now guys that can't stretch the floor. It's like, you have to have a willing guard.
*  You've got to have somebody who wants you involved in some of this stuff. Like Clint
*  Capella living with Harden during those years, that was an awesome version of Clint Capella.
*  Yeah. Cause it's like switch, contest, try to run guys off, drop coverage, all this stuff. Like
*  you're going to be moving around a ton. And then on offense, you're going to be eating for free all
*  the time because Harden was so good at catching the defenders in between decisions. And the second
*  you showed what you were going to do to Harden, he would burn you and Trey is great at that.
*  So if Trey's still there and it's Klingon and I think you said something makes sense with Trey.
*  Yeah. And I think you said something that was really good there too. And it's kind of like the
*  old Belichick thing is we're talking to little pats here is just stop telling me what these guys
*  can't do. Tell me what they can do. And for Klingon, there's nothing to suggest that all
*  of a sudden he's going to start shooting threes in three years. And well, maybe like, maybe we
*  should stop asking for that all the time. Yeah. Quickly. I want to ask you, I know I have to ask
*  you something. Does Castle, do the Spurs make sense? Not for the team they have, but it feels
*  like a very Spurs pick. Like they, I can see them taking them at four and just being like, oh yeah,
*  of course, of course they were going to take them. Right. But I just, there's part of me after the
*  Sohan point guard experiment where I'm like, are you going to kind of try to do a version of this
*  again? Right. Just try to do a better version of it as somebody who actually can play point card
*  a tiny bit. See, I, I just like, I like him more than any wing that they have other than Sohan. So
*  I really like Castle. I at least know what he is, you know, and what the, what the,
*  what the floor for whatever he is, is still somebody that can be in the league and be in the top seven
*  on a playoff team. I think. Can I give you best situation match for every lottery pick? I want
*  you to give them to me. Klingon, I had Atlanta, but I also think he'd be really fun on Memphis
*  and on Charlotte and on OKC. I actually had him on the most teams where I'd be like, oh,
*  that would be fun if he was on that team. Is there any other Klingon team you would have?
*  Memphis. Yeah. Shepherd. Houston and San Antonio seemed fun to me for him. Anybody else?
*  Celtics. We have Pritchard. We don't need him. We have the king of the half court,
*  five step half court shots, paid Pritchard. Special teamer. Castle, San Antonio. I think he'd be a
*  good Detroit. Good wing, right? With, with Cunningham and Jaden and he's like their wing who
*  can play guard. I mean, I don't love the Detroit team, but I actually think he'd play and fit in
*  there. Why are you making a face? Yeah, it's Thompson. If you wanted to go small, yeah,
*  probably playing them at the four. Yeah. I don't hate it. I just really want to see a non-Montey
*  Williams, Jaden, Ivy, Cade Cunningham season. I'm looking forward to it. Well, obviously Detroit
*  is too, since they spent $65 million to take a look at it. SAR is basically for me washed
*  in or bust. It's the funniest outcome. It's going to be hilarious for house. I like that. He's going
*  number two. There's a couple of guys in this draft where it's like, it's actually better that you're
*  not going first. So I think we reached the shades like that too. Him going first makes me nervous
*  for him. Cause I think when you go first, there's this inherent pressure that comes with that. If
*  you're not good right away, or if you have a bad game, people like that fucking guy went first.
*  It's tough. It's really hard. It's, it's, if you're not like a finished product, that's why
*  clinging at least could go first and be like, Oh yeah, okay. I get it. But, uh, I think SAR
*  washed it and I can't think of another team other than maybe Charlotte for him. Yeah. That feels
*  like if San Antonio takes him, you go, Oh, like if he were to fall and you go, Oh my God, San Antonio
*  got this guy, he was supposed to go number one where granted not going to last till six, but
*  if Charlotte takes him, I'm prepared for anything with this draft though. Like remember 2013,
*  New Orleans fell to what six New Orleans was number one, the whole process. And then all of a
*  sudden was dropping like a stone and we didn't know what was going on. Uh, Reese O'Shea, Spurs is the
*  best fit for him for a variety of reasons. Charlotte would be kind of fun too.
*  And then who's your favorite connect team?
*  Uh, I would love to, I don't think he's going to, I think his range is seven, eight, nine, Portland,
*  San Antonio, Memphis. I would love to see him on a good team right away. Like the more I watched
*  Alton, the more I'm like, I know he's older and he would have been great on the last dance because
*  the last dance is basically everybody just got taller. Yeah. But connect, when you go through
*  his entire story, you're like, and then he grew another three inches and then he grew five inches.
*  And then all of a sudden, like he's a stud. Yeah. I don't really know what you would say,
*  like where are the limitations for him? So Portland, by the way, to add on that,
*  if he came to the right team, I think he's a good rookie of the year, but
*  I can see him coming in and immediately scoring first of all, cause he's 24 years old.
*  But if it was a team that actually gave him the ball and ran some plays for him, I think,
*  I just think from a shooting standpoint, I think he could produce immediately.
*  He's a sick athlete. And it's, it's unbelievable watching his misses. How many times you're like,
*  I can't believe that didn't go down. Like there's some of these guys, man, like the dance,
*  like I always joked about how like I wanted to write a book, like the five ways Michael Jordan
*  ruined the NBA. And I'm kidding. Yeah. I really mean it, but it was a generation of players that
*  just thought as long as I take the last second shot and everybody knows that I have that in me,
*  it doesn't matter if it goes in or not. I just going to make sure I take it. Cause that's what
*  MJ would do. Yeah. I think Steph is, especially when you're prepping for the draft, you go, what,
*  who told you that was a good shot? So like when I put down Jacoby Walters fit,
*  I put the Memphis hustle and he thinks he might be Kobe. And I knew it was bad. Who knows? He's a
*  young guy, Baylor freshmen. He has some incredible shot making, but he has some of the worst shot
*  decisions like since Jayden Hardy, but Hardy in a limited situation with Dallas, the guy, he's a
*  sick athlete. He's got the body for it. Can rain them in here a little bit. Yeah. And Jacoby has
*  some of that in him right now because I, when I did the tape for him, I think the third,
*  first thing I wrote down was you're not going to like this guy. And then I just watched like
*  the rest of it. You know, I think the Terrence Shannon thing is really interesting because you
*  want to talk about like wings that can actually, like there's a difference. Like Cody Williams,
*  I think has an idea of what he wants to do, but it seems like he doesn't really know what he's doing
*  half the time on some of these drives. All right. Walter fits into that category. I think Castle
*  even has a little of that. When I watched Shannon just decide he's going to go, like there's another
*  level of shit to his game where it's not the adventure it is for some of these other guys.
*  Like some of these guys are like Cody Williams is a high profile kid. I think the highest rated
*  recruit that ever went to Colorado. He's, he's Jaylen's brother, obviously. And he's this big,
*  long, I mean, he's supposed to kind of be a shooter and a driver and all these things, but man,
*  Hey, a lot of this ends up with you taking 15 foot turnarounds after you try to back a guy out,
*  back a guy down and a clear out on one side for like five seconds. And it leads to this
*  turnaround that everybody wants you to take. Everybody wants you to take that shot. Cause it's
*  so freaking hard. I don't think he would fall to okay. See at 12, but I wonder if they'd feel like
*  they were triple line. Yeah. Jay dubs, Jay, Will and Cody. If your brother's falling,
*  does your team have to take them? If you're the number two priority on your, or maybe number three,
*  I promise you, Sam, uh, we'll do, we'll do whatever he wants to do and not pick butt that off.
