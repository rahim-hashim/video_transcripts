# Is This Suns Experiment Over? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCf-R6h-AVI)
*  All right. So sons wolves, the crazy ownership series, KSC.
*  I am just filled with hatred for myself.
*  I love Minnesota all year.
*  I was so excited to, I even had a bet with them versus the Celtics at 16 to one that I did like 10 days before the playoff started.
*  And then the sons beat the wolves twice in nine days.
*  And they also won that Sacramento game where they won by one and I was out on the sons.
*  I was like, there's something wrong with this team.
*  I don't think they necessarily like each other.
*  This feels like a team that could be one, two, three, Cancun potentially.
*  And then they sucked me back in.
*  And by the time the playoff started, I'm like, they're just a bad matchup for Minnesota.
*  They're going to beat them.
*  And then you watch the game today, game two, a must win.
*  And you watch how the other game two road teams responded.
*  And then you watch what they did.
*  It was the opposite of a response.
*  And in the, in the second half, they just looked miserable.
*  And I wasn't there.
*  I would have loved to have been there.
*  But even TV body language, Dr.
*  Bill was like, I don't like what I'm, what I'm seeing here.
*  I don't see a team that's connected.
*  I see a team that's ready to roll over and go back to Phoenix.
*  And I went from thinking this team was going to potentially beat Minnesota.
*  Minnesota wasn't ready to now wondering if Phoenix might just check out here because
*  they got the Edwards game that they needed today.
*  Edwards kind of stunk today.
*  Like for him, he didn't play that well.
*  But McDaniel steps up and just Minnesota just, just seemed like they were playing harder.
*  And Phoenix just seemed your turn, my turn.
*  And it was bad.
*  What were your takeaways?
*  My takeaways were first of all, it's a good context to it.
*  I felt the same as you and during the series that just a bad matchup for the wolves.
*  And I picked the suns to win the series because they just smoked them during the regular season.
*  And it felt like that New Orleans, that New Orleans Portland year with the Anthony Davis.
*  Sometimes it's just a bad matchup.
*  And that's what I think we both saw in this, but we were up.
*  And ultimately though, the Timberwolves have proven that to be completely false.
*  I mean, we'll see how things return to Phoenix, but there's, I have no faith in the suns at this
*  point with the way in which the wolves have played.
*  You have, I thought tonight was, it looks very bad for Phoenix because as you said, Anthony
*  Edwards was not great.
*  Like he, he still was a positive player for the wolves.
*  He defended his ass off.
*  He was great.
*  He was awesome on Beale.
*  I thought offensively again, like he was in the first game, he was really good as a playmaker.
*  He was decisive.
*  He moved with purpose.
*  He had a kick out in the second quarter.
*  I think it was like Gobert on a short roll, kicked it out to and he immediately just attacked,
*  whipped it to Jaden McDaniels for a three.
*  I thought he was just good overall, even though he wasn't scoring.
*  But ultimately though, like this game for the wolves was about everybody else.
*  Jaden McDaniels in game one was awesome defending Devin Booker tonight.
*  He actually defended Kevin Durant more than he defended Devin Booker.
*  He was still equally impactful on defense in the same way that he was that tonight on
*  offense, Mike Conley stepping up.
*  Like that's something that it feels like the suns are missing is that point guard,
*  like the guy to settle things down where it's your turn, my turn with the suns.
*  Whereas with Mike Conley, his second quarter, I thought he was the reason why the wolves
*  didn't allow the suns to extend the lead because that quarter the suns were pretty good.
*  I think they had a chance to extend the lead, but Conley scored or assisted on 15 of 22 points
*  for the wolves over a stretch showing up everything he can do offensively.
*  Lefty floater, righty floater, three off a screen, pull up out of a pick and roll.
*  He had extension layup.
*  He did everything.
*  And I thought that set up the Conley run, set up the third quarter where
*  Edwards came to life a little bit late.
*  Nikhil Alexander Walker was scoring and playmaking.
*  McDaniels was hitting everything.
*  And that's when they extended their lead.
*  When McDaniels plays like that, they're basically unbeatable.
*  They're incredible when McDaniels is like that.
*  That might be the only time in this series when he plays like that.
*  But ultimately though, I mean, maybe not.
*  I mean, he does have talent.
*  He does.
*  I'm just saying he's not, he was, it was one of those games.
*  For sure.
*  And I mean, this does serve as an example, though, when you look at the
*  Wolf's role players versus the Sun's role players, role players do matter here.
*  When you don't have Ant going off, he's three for seven, three for 12.
*  And Cat was three for seven in the game.
*  And yet you smoke the opponent.
*  That's because of McDaniels.
*  It's because of Conley.
*  It's because because of Alexander Walker.
*  And I was just watching the game tonight.
*  I think so much about the draft.
*  I'm thinking this is why I can't get behind the 2024 draft class stinks.
*  Yes, it lacks star power, but this is a draft class that could be littered with star role players.
*  Guys who could have potentially played in this series.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  And I think the science game was a good example of that.
*  I know, by the way, the name we didn't even mention, Bill Rudy Gobert.
*  This is one of his Hall of Fame performances on defense.
*  Gobert was incredible.
*  He was great.
*  He was amazing.
*  He did everything.
*  He dropped.
*  He defended high in the pick and roll.
*  He switched.
*  Bill Gobert, a booker went 0 for 4 with two turnovers when he defended them.
*  Then those guys man to man go.
*  Bear was amazing.
*  And he's really one of the main reasons why they're up to own the series.
*  I wrote down Minnesota can win without a good Edwards game.
*  Who else can win without a good game from their star in a playoff game like this?
*  And it's basically just them in Boston.
*  I don't think Denver can win if you could sucks.
*  Right.
*  Unless Murray goes for 45.
*  Yeah, Murray would have to.
*  It's a hypothetical because Jokic never sucks.
*  But for him to just really suck, I think it would be hard for them.
*  What about the Knicks though?
*  That Brunson has not been good through two games and they're up 2-0.
*  Does that not count because they're going against the Sixers team with, you know,
*  and be limited and.
*  Yeah, I think that to me is a little more of an in-beat thing.
*  But yeah, Brunson has not been good.
*  You're right.
*  The Knicks probably get thrown in there, but.
*  How about the Thunder?
*  If SGA has like a really off night, I think the Thunder maybe they could.
*  You need a lot of Jalen Williams.
*  You need like the right.
*  Isaiah Joe five threes.
*  Yeah, I think they can get that.
*  Maybe.
*  OKC, Knicks, Celtics.
*  So maybe, you know, about a quarter of the teams in the playoffs.
*  It's weirdly like it's almost a luxury when he has an awesome game.
*  You assume he's going to get be somewhere between 22 and 28.
*  But but they can still survive when he's not good, especially when he's passing like this.
*  I wrote that down.
*  I wrote down this is why you need a point guard.
*  You know, the Suns, they were smarter than all of us, right?
*  It was like we're just going to trade everything for Durant.
*  We're going to be the team that takes Bradley Beal.
*  We don't need role players.
*  We're the team that's going to figure out Nurkic as a reliable center.
*  And then you're watching it just fall apart.
*  I'm holding a thought that I'm going to throw at you.
*  I want to add one more Minnesota thing.
*  Our guy, Jason Goff, who hosts the full go big week in Chicago.
*  They're going to actually have a quarterback for the first time.
*  Jason Goff's lifetime.
*  He had this tweet and I had to brew a special batch of settled down juice for him.
*  Goff said, said it before I'll say it again.
*  Jada Mcdain is my favorite defender to watch.
*  I agree with that.
*  And if he's going to chip in like this offensively in a playoff game,
*  MJ might have found his Scotty.
*  Jason, I'm sending you a 24 pack of settled down juice.
*  Now on paper.
*  Yeah.
*  With J.
*  If Jada Mcdain is going to average 23 a game, I can see it, but he was 10 and five this year.
*  He's 23 years old, but it did make me think.
*  Love you, Goff, by the way.
*  It did make me think like.
*  What more is left here for Jada Mcdain is offensively because he is young.
*  And you figure like this is going to be him and and probably go bear for a few years.
*  Nas read.
*  We'll see if town stays or goes.
*  But what what's left for him offensively?
*  Could he be more than a 10, five guy?
*  Well, that's two things.
*  It's a last season, more so than this year.
*  He showed off some flashes of, you know, pull up shooting ability from mid range.
*  And the hope was that that would translate to a higher volume.
*  It hasn't this year.
*  He shot, I believe, 35% on catching shoot threes last year.
*  He was better than that.
*  He was closer to 40%.
*  So it's him getting that number back up.
*  So it's higher volume pull ups from mid range, kind of that secondary creation.
*  And then it's just better shooting off the catch.
*  I think those are the two main things you want to see from McDaniel's moving forward with him.
*  And if you get that, then maybe you get nights like this with more frequency.
*  I don't think he's going to be the pimp into to MJ for Anthony Edwards.
*  But I think it's a bold call.
*  I liked it.
*  There is more to his game, though, and he's shown flashes.
*  It's just about putting it together.
*  And I mean, that's what made it cool to see that tonight from him.
*  Well, I looked at his his shot chart.
*  I like ESPN when you can go to the shot chart.
*  He made a couple threes, but a lot of his stuff was in the paint.
*  And I think the thing I like about him, I like when he goes to the basket.
*  I like when he just decisively drives.
*  And I don't feel like he does that a lot.
*  Maybe some of it has to go bears blocking the thing.
*  But I think we all like him.
*  It was funny when they traded for Go Bear and then they put the stuff out.
*  We told them Jaden McDaniels is off limits after they gave up like 18 first round picks.
*  I was like, Congrats, you kept Jaden McDaniels.
*  But he is good.
*  All right, it's time.
*  This is one of my big questions.
*  Kyle might have to turn on the hotel room Tick Tock camera on.
*  Are we going to be making up Devon Booker trades in late June?
*  Booker before Durant's or both?
*  Durant can't get traded again.
*  I can't handle that emotionally.
*  Not again.
*  What does he have to lose?
*  Not again.
*  Where's he going to go now?
*  He's already tarnished his reputation ever since leaving Golden State.
*  Is he going to wander around the league and just fight in different teams?
*  He's liking posts about Chet on Instagram.
*  It might be he wants to go back to OKC.
*  I don't know if they'd want him back.
*  Phoenix calls New Orleans late June after they get swept by the Wolves here.
*  Let's go worst case scenario.
*  They get swept.
*  And it's like, Oh man, Frank Vogel, you're the fall guy.
*  But maybe that's not enough.
*  They're in the room.
*  It's Ishbia who can't believe that he's traded all of his picks and he's a second apron team.
*  And he has two playoff victories in two years to show for it.
*  Ishbia and whoever's inner circle is, they're like, let's call New Orleans.
*  Griffin answers and he says, CJ McCollum and Trey Murphy and throw us two future picks.
*  And you can have Booker.
*  I need more than that for Devin Booker.
*  I'm saying two good future firsts.
*  Give me five firsts.
*  Five firsts with Trey Murphy.
*  I like Trey Murphy a hell of a lot, but he's a role player.
*  You need so you think he's a role player.
*  I think he's more than a role player.
*  I actually think he's I just don't know if they hand potentially special.
*  I think he should be shooting more than eight, nine, three is a game.
*  I think it should be like 12, 13 shots per game from three.
*  The dude is a ridiculous lights out shooter.
*  He's amazing.
*  He attacks close out.
*  So how many firsts you want?
*  You want five firsts.
*  Yeah, I'd want I'd want pretty much, you know, everything back, you know,
*  that like I've given up for some of these other star players.
*  I want five.
*  I want six for Devin Booker with the years left on his deal.
*  How many years are left though?
*  I thought it was kind of getting a little is that are we inching a little closer to the end there?
*  Two thousand twenty six.
*  Let's look this up real quick.
*  Booker Booker is signed through twenty, twenty eight.
*  So there's time.
*  Oh, yeah, you're right.
*  Here of that extension.
*  So we had the new extension.
*  When we keep the video going with that, we got to reflect that.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's with that many years on his contract, it's it's four or five firsts.
*  Yeah, I think we'll see him call him and Trey Murphy.
*  I mean, I'd be who has a longer meeting.
*  I'd be intrigued from the Phoenix side of things of just blowing things up completely,
*  considering if you do suffer a first round loss, worst case scenario sweep,
*  you got to be looking at the drawing board saying there's literally nothing that we can do.
*  You don't have future assets.
*  You don't have young players to play.
*  You're not allowed to sign free agents because you're over the second April.
*  Yes.
*  And not only that, the swaps that you've already traded, sometimes you've traded
*  the swaps twice further diminishing the value of your big swaps.
*  Like they've tried to get creative with the limited amount of assets they have,
*  but they got nothing to make significant moves.
*  And this is a fundamentally flawed team.
*  The only counter I would have to their bills instead of trading Devin Booker at 28 years
*  old, you're probably not trading Beale either.
*  He has a no trade clause and he doesn't have great value anyway.
*  If you did decide to trade Kevin Durant again, he's the guy that would still have the money.
*  He's the guy that would still have some value.
*  He's still really good.
*  He's still a top 10 to 15 player in the league.
*  Maybe flipping KD.
*  36 next year.
*  He's old.
*  Maybe flipping him into multiple pieces and picks is something that could be mutually
*  beneficial for your team and the receiving team.
*  To me, I still want to hang on to Booker.
*  He's in the first year of his deal.
*  It's too soon for me to give up on Devin Booker, especially given the fact that you don't own
*  your own picks moving forward.
*  So if you suck or you're stuck in the middle, where are you exactly?
*  You still want to compete.
*  So I'd still want to hang on to Devin Booker at this point.
*  What if you traded Booker and Durant?
*  What if you traded Durant to the Warriors?
*  I don't know.
*  This is the kind of stuff.
*  The point is I was thinking about this stuff during the fourth quarter of that game where
*  I was like, wow, this is now officially like we're in blow it up.
*  Phil, as you would call it.
*  It is entering that neighborhood because of the fact that they have nothing to do.
*  Ultimately, it should be a stop sign going, wait, is that a right turn to blow it up?
*  If you are Devin Booker specifically, I think if you're the sons, you want to hang on to
*  these guys.
*  You have nothing else you can do.
*  You want to compete and hope you get lucky.
*  But if you're Devin Booker specifically, you're like, I'm 20 years old.
*  I'm an all NBA caliber player.
*  I'm an all star.
*  I've been to the finals.
*  I've flourished at the on the biggest stages.
*  Do I really want to be here?
*  If you're Booker, I think those thoughts begin entering your mind this summer because why
*  would they not?
*  It's only natural when you're a competitor like that, when you have his mindset.
*  So I think for Booker, he should be thinking about it.
*  But I think it's too soon.
*  It's one year too soon.
*  But one year from now, I think it's very reasonable for something that big and that massive,
*  a blow it up situation to occur for the sons.
*  But we're nearing the point that they should think about it.
*  I'm glad we talked it out.
*  It would be interesting if they did a Booker trade and a Durant trade and just said,
*  F it.
*  We want to play off games with these guys in two years.
*  It didn't work.
*  We're moving on.
*  Let's get our backs back.
*  Think about the good vibes of this team just a couple of years ago.
*  Mikkel Bridges, Cam Johnson, up and up and coming team.
*  So they're not bright future sons.
*  What are they?
*  The bleak future sons.
*  The sad, sad sex sons.
*  We just pull out a thesaurus and pull out a whole bunch of words here for Phoenix.
*  I feel bad for sons fans because things were so bad for a while and then they got really
*  good and really optimistic and they got good fast.
*  And now you're in this position.
*  It's awful.
*  It really is awful because it feels like if you're ranking teams with the bleakest futures,
*  they're in the top five, right?
*  Who else is there?
*  The Bulls?
*  There they are.
*  Well, I'm not ready to say that until we see how this round one plays out because there's
*  a chance they go to Phoenix and they play awesome and we're like, oh, the sons.
*  Here we go.
*  It was the first time I started really thinking like, holy shit, like this could get bad.
*  What if Booker just says, get me the fuck out of here?
*  But to your point, if they get swept or lose on five, like it within that context, it's like.
*  To put a bow in this, I don't think they would trade Devin Booker unless he was like,
*  I'm unhappy.
*  I'd like to be traded.
*  I agree.
*  And then even then, I don't know if they would trade them.
*  I think the Knicks would be a possibility for that.
*  The Knicks have still held all their stuff for some sort of mega deal.
*  Miami would be possibility, so on and so on.
*  That one gets tougher if you start thinking about they get swept.
*  This gets ugly.
*  Where does Durant go?
*  And, you know, all roads, maybe lead back to the old state.
*  Who knows?
*  Well, maybe they'll win.
*  Maybe they'll win game three and this will sound like a dumb conversation.
*  Katie only next year left on his contract as well.
*  Just one year left on his.
*  Who would have thought Kyrie would be in a better spot than Kevin Durant?
*  What were the odds of that a year ago?
*  I don't know.
*  Things seem really good with Kyrie right now.
*  We are, this was the crazy ownership series, by the way.
*  There was all that stuff about the Minnesota non-sale today.
*  Joe Pompoliano wrote a really good piece about it.
*  And so you have that and then you have Ishby on the other end,
*  who's like new owner syndrome personified.
*  They're battling for the weird ownership.
