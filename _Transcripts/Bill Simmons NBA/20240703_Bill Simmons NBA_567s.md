# The Celtics are selling… why? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [July 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg)
*  The other announcement we had, which is with Grosbeck selling his share of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=0.0s)]
*  team and the way this got reported initially was like the Celtics, their [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=3.9s)]
*  whole ownership group is for sale. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=8.78s)]
*  It's actually just the WIC part and probably his, his, uh, the stake [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=10.74s)]
*  that his dad had as well. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=15.14s)]
*  When WIC, WIC Grosbeck bought the team in 2003, he put together a group. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=16.3s)]
*  And the biggest money person in that group was his dad, Irv Grosbeck, who [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=20.7s)]
*  was just a famous business guy. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=25.22s)]
*  And then he had Jim Pilato was in the group. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=27.64s)]
*  Steve Pegg, Luca was a big shareholder in the group. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=29.8s)]
*  He had some other people as well. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=32.28s)]
*  And because the Grosbecks had the most money, WIC was the governor of the team. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=34.24s)]
*  That means he is the steering wheel. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  He's in charge. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=40.56s)]
*  Ultimately, he's the face of the team. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=41.32s)]
*  He represents them in the owners meetings. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=43.16s)]
*  And I got the feeling, not just from, from him, um, just from just little, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=46.24s)]
*  little, little hints dropped here and there the last couple of years, but you [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=54.620000000000005s)]
*  get, you hear this from the other teams too. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=57.86s)]
*  A lot of these guys are business dudes who fundamentally they're wired to [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=60.58s)]
*  make an investment and when you 10 times it or 15 times it or 20 times it, it's [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=65.9s)]
*  time to sell the investment no matter how you're, how attached you are to it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=71.22s)]
*  That's just how they're wired. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=74.14s)]
*  And I think once the valuations started to shoot up, especially with the, with [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=76.38s)]
*  Ishby was, was the catalyst a year and a half ago when he paid for Sarva share [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=81.08s)]
*  the sons, what he paid, what the team was valued at that caught everyone's attention. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=86.72s)]
*  Cause they were like, this is nuts. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=91.32s)]
*  If you go back to 2010, even the step I was writing for ESPN and eventually [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=92.44s)]
*  Grantland at the time during the lockout, there was real fear that the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  franchise values had cratered. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=101.47999999999999s)]
*  Um, you're talking about the Sixers, the warriors, uh, the Hornets, some of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=104.3s)]
*  these teams, the Grizzlies, some of these teams got stolen for, you know, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=111.22s)]
*  less than 300 million, the Hornets. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=115.86s)]
*  They basically gave it to Jordan. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=117.41999999999999s)]
*  Um, the warriors was one of the best deals ever. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=119.41999999999999s)]
*  I said that at the time and everybody was worried that the prices of these [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=121.94s)]
*  teams were going to level off and maybe go down because they couldn't figure out. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=126.52s)]
*  The, uh, the CBA with the players that couldn't figure out where the next [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=130.72s)]
*  media money stuff was coming from. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=134.32s)]
*  Well, now that's obviously flipped. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=135.88s)]
*  And now we're hitting the second point that reminds me a little 2010, where I [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=137.96s)]
*  think that some of the people that own these teams are going, not only is, is [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=141.68s)]
*  the team never going to be more valuable than this, the amount of people eligible [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=146.28s)]
*  to buy my team is dwindling by the day. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=152.64s)]
*  I talked to somebody, um, in the rich guy circles this week and I was like, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=155.72s)]
*  how many people have the ability to, to just cut a check for a team at this point? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=160.94s)]
*  You know, if the checks 4 billion, 5 billion, even if it's 40, 50%, you're [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=167.94s)]
*  still cutting a check for like 2 billion, 2 and a half billion. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=172.06s)]
*  I was like, how many people are out there that could just do that? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=174.7s)]
*  And, and the guy said, not many. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=177.14s)]
*  And I know all of them. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=180.22s)]
*  And that's what you're dealing with. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=182.44s)]
*  So I think for, for wick, he's looking at it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=183.66s)]
*  He's probably 20 tuple the value of his team. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=186.48s)]
*  I think the Celtics are worth. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=188.44s)]
*  Five, 5 billion. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=191.72s)]
*  They don't own their own arena, but if the sons are worth 4 billion, there's [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=193.28s)]
*  an extra billion just for the Celtics. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=197.28s)]
*  One of the most iconic franchises in any sport beloved in Boston, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=199.84s)]
*  um, sell out every year. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=203.76s)]
*  It's a great team. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=205.62s)]
*  If you take over this team, you're sitting courtside and you're going [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=206.92s)]
*  to be in the playoffs every year. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=209.84s)]
*  Like there's real intrinsic value to this. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=210.9s)]
*  That's at least 5 billion. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=214.38s)]
*  And then you figure if two people are going at each other, maybe it gets to six. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=215.54s)]
*  My guess would be somewhere between five, seven and six is the value of this team. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=219.54s)]
*  And if you're buying the gross back shares, maybe that's a $2 million check [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=224.9s)]
*  to be the majority governor. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=229.57999999999998s)]
*  I don't, I don't know what the exact numbers are. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=232.1s)]
*  And he's probably looking at it like, it's never going to be better than this. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=235.62s)]
*  I won my 18th title for the, for the franchise wicks second, but the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=238.28s)]
*  18th for the franchise that tax, all the salary stuff I mentioned is coming. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=243.6s)]
*  Tatum Brown, who knows is somebody I have to break them up two, three years from [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=250.12s)]
*  now, he doesn't want that on him. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=253.76s)]
*  He's leaving and he's just remembered as this awesome owner. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  He probably looks at what happened with the Red Sox. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=259.2s)]
*  John Henry brings the Red Sox and Tom Warner bring the Red Sox, the title. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=261.8s)]
*  They went for world series. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=265.46s)]
*  And then now nobody in Boston can stand John Henry because he's ruined the Red [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=267.5s)]
*  Sox over the last four or five years with some of the decisions they've made. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=272.68s)]
*  So that's how fast they can flip Bob craft. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=276.02s)]
*  Not as bad as the John Henry thing, but he went from everybody loved the dude to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=278.74s)]
*  over the course of one winter, thanks to the Apple doc and how Belichick was treated. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=283.62s)]
*  And now people are like craft kind of a bummer. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=288.28000000000003s)]
*  This guy couldn't have paid for a drink anywhere in Boston for 20 years. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=290.92s)]
*  And now people are looking at him a little side. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=295.68s)]
*  So I'm sure Wicks saw some of that too. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=298.06s)]
*  But the big thing for me, you could talk about, Oh, there's all these people that [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=299.68s)]
*  are coming in, there's could be a casino, casino could build downtown Boston. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=303.44s)]
*  Some just super rich person, mystery person who's always one, one and own the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=308.0s)]
*  Celtics, you could give me a bunch of scenarios, but I think the owner, the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=312.36s)]
*  next owner of the team is already an owner of the team. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=316.44s)]
*  I think it's Steve Pagliuca. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=318.68s)]
*  Who was really the number two owner on this team the whole time. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=320.74s)]
*  And was somebody that, um, you know, you'd see him on the podium. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=325.78000000000003s)]
*  He didn't have the steering wheel and you always knew he wanted it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=333.82s)]
*  And then he ran for a political office in Massachusetts, spent a ton of [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=337.78000000000003s)]
*  money on his campaign, didn't get it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=341.06s)]
*  He went for the nets a few years ago and had it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=343.16s)]
*  He had the nets. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=347.0s)]
*  And I think there was, I forget what happened at the 11th hour, but something [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=348.91999999999996s)]
*  happened, he froze or he backed off for a split second and Joe size stepped in and [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=354.35999999999996s)]
*  took it and he probably shouldn't have taken the nets because that's when you [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  consider Barclays and all the other stuff in there, that that was probably a [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=364.35999999999996s)]
*  good deal way more than what he was going to pay. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=367.56s)]
*  So I think he wants it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=370.09999999999997s)]
*  He also has a stake. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=371.0s)]
*  And usually when you have these ownership groups, if you're buying in. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=372.65999999999997s)]
*  The other partners have the right to be like, well, then it's called a put you [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=378.08s)]
*  have, well, then you have to buy me out too. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=382.53999999999996s)]
*  And that's what happened in Phoenix. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=385.62s)]
*  And that's why the Ishby thing, like you, it's a bigger check than just [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=386.96s)]
*  writing the check for the majority guy. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=389.78s)]
*  So this is all easier in a hundred different ways. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=391.59999999999997s)]
*  If PAGS just takes it over. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=394.17999999999995s)]
*  And he had a statement later in the day yesterday saying how, um, he couldn't [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=396.21999999999997s)]
*  wait to be a bidder for the team, be a proud bid, proud member of the bidding [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=402.21999999999997s)]
*  process, whatever he said, I think it's going to be PAGS. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=406.6s)]
*  I think he's ready for it. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=409.24s)]
*  And, um, whatever happens here with the ownership process, it's a really [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=410.96000000000004s)]
*  interesting one because these guys have worked side by side now for 21 years. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=416.48s)]
*  And the easy thing would be for WIC to just sell his share to PAGS and let him [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=420.04s)]
*  take over, but he's going to do this as a whole process and get the most [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=423.28000000000003s)]
*  amount of money he's going to get. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=426.44s)]
*  I'd be shocked if PAGS didn't get the team. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=428.22s)]
*  And if he gets the team, that's good for Boston fans because what they've had [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=430.56s)]
*  with WIC Grossback in this whole ownership group, the last 20 years has [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=435.15999999999997s)]
*  been, you can't ask for more. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=439.91999999999996s)]
*  It's, but it's, I wouldn't say it's an A plus, but it's been an A, especially, um, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=442.53999999999996s)]
*  how they were able to ride out that KG error. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=447.12s)]
*  They got a title out of it and then it, it peters out the rebuild and then [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=450.52s)]
*  immediately good again, and they've spent money every time they've had to. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=455.18s)]
*  And when you think about some of the owners, the Celtics have had in the [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=459.0s)]
*  past, Paul Gaston's, um, it was just an endless slew of guys that owned the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=461.2s)]
*  team in the, in the seventies and eighties. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=466.68s)]
*  They were like the drunk step dads that would come in for a couple of years, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=469.0s)]
*  owned the team, red our backward, try to hold them off. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=471.68s)]
*  Then we go to the next guy. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=473.76s)]
*  Uh, they've been great owners. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=475.32s)]
*  So I think I was talking to my dad about it yesterday and he was like, man, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=477.7s)]
*  my dad was like really bummed out. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=481.4s)]
*  He was like, why now? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=483.28s)]
*  Why we just won the title, the Tatum extension and the white extension. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=485.28s)]
*  Why would they do this now? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=489.8s)]
*  And I, you know, I think it's because this is the right time to sell and you get [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=491.28000000000003s)]
*  the process going and see what's going to happen. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=495.2s)]
*  My guess is Wicks going to be involved for at least a couple of years. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=497.36s)]
*  But as we saw with Mark Cuban in Dallas, they say that, but the moment that team [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=501.24s)]
*  transfers hands, they start nudging the other dude out. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=505.16s)]
*  You didn't see Cuban on the podium in the Western conference playoffs. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=507.84000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=510.96000000000004s)]
*  This is a guy who's, oh no, I'm still, I'm in charge of basketball. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=511.40000000000003s)]
*  It was like, he got just gently nudged to the side. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=513.8s)]
*  And that's what happens when you don't own the team anymore. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=517.48s)]
*  And that's why these guys are so, so scared to sell it sometimes because once [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=519.64s)]
*  you sell it, it's never the same. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=524.68s)]
*  You're not the guy. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=527.76s)]
*  You're not sitting there and the, you picked your seat on court side. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=528.68s)]
*  You're the first call from everybody. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=532.8s)]
*  Like that's it. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=534.76s)]
*  And whether you're the owner of a team, whether you're a commissioner, whether [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=536.04s)]
*  you're Lord Michael's running Saturday live, whoever you are, once you give up [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=539.68s)]
*  that job, it's never the same. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=544.12s)]
*  So I don't think he took the decision lately, but he did it and, uh, he was [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=546.56s)]
*  an awesome, awesome sports owner. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=550.8s)]
*  So we'll see how it goes. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSmFmgcNSg&t=555.0s)]
