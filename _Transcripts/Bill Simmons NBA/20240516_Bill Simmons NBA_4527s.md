# Nuggets vs. Timberwolves Game 6 LIVE NBA Playoffs Reaction with Bill Simmons and Rob Mahoney
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmev50uUqHc)
*  But then you watch a game like tonight and LeBron kicked his ass.
*  He's not ready to be a top 15 guy.
*  He really, really, really gives a shit about every game.
*  It's great.
*  I love it.
*  This is a long sustained offensive excellence that when you watch it feels legitimate.
*  We're not going to be nice.
*  What do we care?
*  We're just these.
*  Let's call it what it is.
*  All right, we're live on YouTube.
*  This was not a scenario I expected.
*  Chris Ryan is here.
*  Rob Mahoney is here and Denver, Minnesota, Game 6, which had a chance to be game of
*  the year is still happening as we tape this.
*  It is 114 to 68 Minnesota.
*  This series got shaken up in a snow globe and sniff some bath salts and just went in
*  yet another direction.
*  CR, we never get to start with you.
*  You're just a guy.
*  I'm just a guy on a couch.
*  Guy on a couch.
*  You know, you haven't been out there in a game six, but you have some thoughts.
*  I bet a thousand dollars on Denver under 70.
*  Do you think that's going to?
*  You're still in it.
*  It's looking real good.
*  Mahoney, what happened?
*  Why?
*  Why?
*  Why is the series torturing us?
*  And I saw on Twitter somebody.
*  What?
*  I don't even follow that many people, but somebody was like, we deserve a game.
*  What is going on in the series?
*  Yeah, it's been incredibly topsy-turvy.
*  Honestly, this one, it really felt like the wolves wanted in five minutes.
*  It was that 20, 0 run in the first quarter and Denver never got their
*  bearings after that, even though you could see the desperation, you could
*  see them shifting the rotation.
*  They started Jokic in the second quarter.
*  They never do that.
*  That's always his time to rest, but you could tell they knew we can't
*  afford to lose these minutes as well.
*  And it didn't mean a day off.
*  It was a day off.
*  It was a day off.
*  I thought it was just so stark.
*  It felt like the nuggets had nothing and it felt like everything was so easy
*  for the wolves all of a sudden.
*  I thought this was going to be what happened in game three.
*  And yet game three, game four, game five, Denver flipped it.
*  And I don't know where this effort went for Minnesota, but in game six, it came
*  back, you could see it immediately.
*  They were flying around and doing the pit bull thing and they were just
*  doing it for the first time.
*  And I thought that was going to be the first time they were doing it.
*  And then when it came back, you could see it immediately.
*  They were flying around and doing the pit bull thing again.
*  But what happened, CR?
*  Can we lose the eye of the tiger?
*  What happened?
*  It felt like a different crowd here compared to game three, too.
*  It felt like Minnesota really showed up last.
*  Could be the last game that they get to see these guys play this season.
*  And it just felt like these guys were like tapped in.
*  They took an eight ball of home crowd tonight before this game.
*  And they're just like flying around.
*  They're jumping up in every passing lane and seem to be playing with like
*  more extra energy than Denver had.
*  And, you know, sometimes you watch game sixes like this and you wonder whether
*  or not that team that has the home game seven is like, all right, we got you guys.
*  Next one. You know what I mean?
*  Like we're not going to overextend ourselves.
*  And basically you're watching to make sure like Gordon and Murray get up off the
*  floor when they hit the deck every couple of times.
*  I did feel like.
*  Right as right before Finch pulled his guys and they were just chucking threes,
*  they did a cutaway.
*  The killer, Alexander Walker, hit a three.
*  They did a cutaway to Yokech on the bench.
*  And he definitely had the look of a guy who was a bad guy in commando.
*  And he was like, I'm going to tear off your head and shake on Sunday.
*  He had that like, like when I come back, it's for all of you.
*  So I'm not if I'm Minnesota, I enjoy it while it lasts.
*  I feel like there's another Denver card to be played.
*  Yeah, I don't want to I don't want to play the deserve card that you were talking
*  about, but I don't know what we deserve as a people, as a human race.
*  I don't know that we deserve nice things, but I would sure love a very competitive,
*  hard fought game seven.
*  That's not a 30 point blowout.
*  Right.
*  Well, I, for some reason, and I didn't bet on tonight's game, but Denver was
*  favorite was getting plus they were plus two, which seemed like, wow, that's crazy.
*  They just won the last three.
*  But the reason I thought I was a stay away was it was hard for me to imagine
*  Minnesota just losing four straight games.
*  I heard a sad at Termini and Eddie, I was driving around listening, driving to work
*  today and they were talking and I think they had only lost three games once the
*  whole year.
*  Yeah, it's just really hard to beat a team four straight times unless they have
*  some real flaws or you're like have just massive strength.
*  So that was in my head.
*  I'm like, oh, maybe Minnesota and if they get a big game, but this was like all the
*  reasons they won games one and two.
*  Like Murray in games one, two and six, 13 for 48.
*  Right.
*  In three, four or five, he was way better.
*  Denver's three pointers in games three, four and five.
*  They were 36 for 75, 48%.
*  And what were they tonight?
*  Seven, seven for 36.
*  Yeah.
*  19% tonight.
*  19.
*  Chris, should we just start a podcast where the entire analysis is just whoever
*  makes more threes wins?
*  Because I honestly feel like that was OKC Dallas last night.
*  That probably just couldn't make a three in Dallas made two threes they shouldn't
*  have made and they won by 10 NBA podcasting in 2032.
*  It's just going to be the Morrie ball and it's an AI that's like this team made
*  41 threes.
*  You know, it's like and that'll be that'll be it.
*  But you're right.
*  I mean, I thought maybe the key to this game, honestly, you know, not to not to
*  grab onto something Richard Jefferson said, but you could just tell Mike Conley
*  makes a huge difference to Minnesota.
*  Yeah, the three pointer.
*  Definitely.
*  I'm sure you'll return to that.
*  But I couldn't believe like just the decision making was much more solid.
*  And to the extent that you can calm guys like Kat down and keep them attached to
*  the earth, he really seemed to do a good job of that.
*  But there were like little things where it's like he has an open shop, but he's
*  going to get going.
*  Like you always talk about this bill, the importance of point guards, the
*  importance of like knowing who needs it, knowing who needs to get rolling, knowing
*  who's got it going and needs to keep it going.
*  And I think Mike Conley is a consummate example.
*  Like he's just like the point guard.
*  If you close your eyes and you're just like, who's the dude is going to get 13
*  but set everybody up?
*  It's him.
*  And if he's this healthy looking, we've gone from Achilles strain to he looks
*  fine to me, if he can go back on Sunday, I don't know.
*  I mean, like this is a much more of a coin toss than I think Denver maybe would
*  be comfortable with.
*  I want to split both of those points, though, because I think the playmaking
*  from Minnesota was a huge part of this game.
*  And having Conley clearly critical to that, but also just having days in
*  between to look at the tape and have a plan of how to deal with the doubles.
*  It felt like the wolves just didn't have a clear idea of what they
*  wanted to do last time.
*  And so having some, some opportunity to establish, this is the rhythm, this is
*  the read, this is where you're looking when the double comes against cat, when
*  the double comes against aunt, because the nuggets are throwing that stuff at them.
*  And of course, when you're kicking to Conley, you can trust that the swing is
*  going to be the right swing or he's going to find go bear inside.
*  If that read is there, the three point thing, I think is more complicated because
*  I agree.
*  OKC Dallas definitely felt that way to me.
*  This one didn't.
*  And I think it was in part because there was so much kind of like defense
*  affecting offense and offense, affecting defense in this game, as far as the
*  energy and the momentum that yes, Denver miss a ton of threes, but a lot of those
*  possessions where they took threes, they didn't even get the ball inside the
*  three point line.
*  They were just kind of frittering around the perimeter for 20 seconds.
*  And so, yes, that's missing a three, but it's also just bad process and great
*  defense.
*  Great point.
*  Yeah, the defense, you know, it just looked like the game to think, see, I'd
*  like to thank you for crediting me with caring about the point guard position and
*  pointing out that it's important because I don't think anyone ever come up with
*  that before, but it does, you know, you could feel it in game five because they
*  were just throwing some pretty rudimentary traps and stuff at Edwards, but
*  there was nobody else that could kind of take the load off them and help them out
*  and all that stuff.
*  Michael Porter Jr.
*  Is becoming a storyline in this series.
*  Maybe not a road dog.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Has he been a home dog in this series?
*  What's his best game?
*  I guess he was in the 117.
*  That was game three.
*  He had 21.
*  Yeah.
*  But we've gotten into the game one last and he's a single digits and four of the
*  six games in the city.
*  Yeah.
*  And Malone has been closing games with Christian Brown instead of him as he
*  should because Christian Brown.
*  Yeah.
*  He looks like volumes.
*  Dante di Vincenzo West out there.
*  You know, it's like he's he looks really good.
*  Wait, can I do an NBA countdown on this?
*  Michael Porter Jr.
*  You have to step up.
*  It's the playoffs.
*  It's a game seven at home.
*  Michael Porter Jr.
*  You got to step up.
*  He hasn't been very good, but he's got a lot of family shit going on and there's
*  there's just no way that's not going to affect him like a tiny bit.
*  Brown's been better.
*  Their bench, Denver's bench in three, four or five was way more impactful than
*  it was tonight.
*  But, you know, I hate to just reduce it to this, but if if Murray sucks, I don't
*  think Denver can beat this Minnesota team unless they shit the bed completely.
*  Because or you'll get goes God mode and yeah, and is doing the but even him going
*  God mode, he still needs the Murray piece to at least help him a little bit.
*  Go God mode.
*  If the team, if the if Minnesota is just not that worried about Murray, I don't
*  really know what the with the other apps like what like let's say Murray has a
*  bad game seven Rob, what's the roadmap for Denver winning anyway?
*  I mean, it depends on how Minnesota is guarding them.
*  And if Murray is off and he was distinctly off in this one, it only encourages them
*  to double Yokech more to throw more bodies at him in more difficult situations
*  where all of a sudden Michael Porter and KCP are having to finish a lot of
*  possessions.
*  I think it gets really tricky really fast from a playmaking perspective.
*  If Jamal is off and I mean, did I see this right that he just straight like
*  airballed a layup in the middle of this game?
*  There were some plays that were really ugly for him.
*  And I'll say this too.
*  We're coming off of the great Rudy Rudy go bare discourse of 2024 as we do often
*  this time of year got absolutely cooked by Yokech in Game five.
*  There's no there's no mistaking it.
*  Jamal Murray did not want to take a shot around Rudy go bare in this game.
*  And to me, go bears value is much less what he does to Yokech, even though
*  obviously he's shading and helping and playing off of Gordon doing all those
*  things. It's with us to everybody else when they go near the basket.
*  And if Denver doesn't have that avenue to offense, I think it gets really tough
*  for them sometimes.
*  Rob, when you say the go bare debate, are you talking about the debate about
*  whether Rudy go bare could play in the NFL?
*  What's his best position?
*  It's like tight end, just short yardage inside the five yard line.
*  The go bare debate was interesting because nobody was pointing other people who
*  have stopped Yokech in the past couple of years.
*  Like, where was the list?
*  Yeah.
*  What is the list of the guys who are like, hey, Rudy go bare, why can't you be
*  like this guy over here, the guy that shut down Yokech?
*  It doesn't exist.
*  They're really the only time we've seen somebody go toe to toe with him.
*  In any real way was Embiid in a couple of those Philly games, you know, when
*  Embiid was okay with playing against Yokech, which was usually at home, not
*  in Denver, the altitude, but at home.
*  But that was really the only time I saw somebody throwing real haymakers at
*  Yokech and knocking them backwards.
*  I don't know.
*  Nobody can guard him.
*  Davis, Davis did a nice job with the Lakers, at least like making them work,
*  but he still outplayed Davis in both of those series.
*  Did you think that-
*  I just don't know who the player is.
*  Yokech was a little passive tonight.
*  Or do you think it was like he saw it was out of control early and is just like,
*  I'm saving, I'm saving the tank for Sunday.
*  Well, you think he's got the Terminator brand, right?
*  So he's walking in the bar like in Terminator and he's just like scanning
*  all the, all the threats and all that.
*  And maybe the computer brand was just scanned.
*  It's like threat high, can't win, save energy Sunday.
*  Are they playing Saturday or Sunday?
*  I can't remember.
*  Sunday.
*  Yeah.
*  So he's the Terminator.
*  He's a commando villain.
*  I mean, we got time to get Predator in here, die hard.
*  Like let's, let's keep it moving.
*  Well, he's definitely like one of the taken, the guys at the end on the yacht,
*  right, that Liam Neeson has to go through to get to the Sultan.
*  He's one of the three guys at the end.
*  Now I feel like you're just typecasting it based on country of origin.
*  I know.
*  I just think he looks like, he looks like the scary bodyguard two guys before
*  our hero gets to kill the final guy.
*  Right.
*  It's like, Oh, this is going to be a fight.
*  He's taking this guy on now.
*  Uh, I think his brothers are probably the last guys, but yeah, he's, he's a bunch
*  of different, uh, bunch of different villains.
*  I, to me, he, he was the only one I felt okay about on the Denver side today.
*  The, the Caldwell Pope Edwards feeling comfortable again, taking him back and
*  him down and doing the MJ turnaround.
*  I thought was a bad sign, but Denver had solved that.
*  And in general, I thought they had solved some ant stuff.
*  And then today really the only thing that, uh, that was positive for Denver
*  was that it looked like ant fell seven feet to the ground at one point.
*  And maybe he was going to get carried out.
*  Then he gets right up.
*  He's fine.
*  That was going to be one of the all time dumbest leaving your guys in up 25.
*  Like if ant had had accidentally like broken his coccyx, like trying
*  to climb the ladder there, uh,
*  He might know who knows.
*  I mean, he, he might be actually heard of just like, yeah, it's fine.
*  I'll, I'll wear, I'll care about it later.
*  Uh, that was one of those that if you were, you know, 35, 32 years old,
*  you're probably still down.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, I'm hurting just from watching him.
*  If you're 45, you're dead.
*  What did you see from how the, uh, T Wolves in the, in the parts of the game
*  that mattered, Rob, did they do anything different with the Oak edge or it was
*  just the shooting went sideways and it didn't matter.
*  I didn't see anything dramatically different.
*  I think there was a little more pressure than the one-on-one cooking that he had
*  an opportunity to do in game five.
*  So that was a, it felt a little bit different and they were able to kind
*  of shade into his space a bit more.
*  But mostly I thought they rushed him.
*  I thought they just had a better sense of his timing in this.
*  And honestly, Yoke, it's just looked a little bit more mortal.
*  You know, some of those push shots, some of the stuff around the rim.
*  And again, that's all of this feeding into itself of him feeling the urgency
*  and the necessity of having to hit those shots.
*  And then all of a sudden they stopped going when, when everything is kind
*  of counting on you in that moment.
*  And you know, Jamal doesn't have it.
*  Mike Porter doesn't have it.
*  Aaron Gordon isn't even as accessible in this game as he's been in some of the other ones.
*  Rob, did they have Kat on Jokic more?
*  I guess I didn't really notice that from game five.
*  Like, do you, was Kat his primary defender this whole stretch or was this a,
*  adjustment by and large, Kat, and especially in that first quarter, I thought Kat played
*  great defense one-on-one against Jokic.
*  And I mean, I find myself apparently just going into full blown Rudy Gobert PR.
*  But I love it.
*  I thought part of the issue in game five for them was Kat got in foul trouble so early
*  that Gobert had to be the primary for large portions of that game when nobody really
*  wants that to happen, the Timberwolves included.
*  And so the more that Kat can stay in these games and be this effective, the better off
*  they're going to have even just like a chance to win.
*  Plus, I mean, where was Luke Garza in game five?
*  I don't know. I hadn't heard that point from anybody.
*  I bet there's a there's a very good correlation between Luke Garza getting on the floor in
*  a playoff game and them winning because it's usually you're up by 30.
*  Them winning by 40 or losing by 40.
*  I don't mind Luke Garza.
*  Let's let's take a quick break for the podcast.
*  And I want to throw some Jokic that's a break.
*  Come back here. We're back. Hey, guys.
*  I did all this Jokic work thinking if they won tonight,
*  and he would at least have a good game or if it was a close game, he'd have a good game.
*  So some of these stats are off.
*  But I was looking at all the guys who played at least 75 playoff games,
*  where he ranked in points, rebounds and assists just against the 75 plus playoff game guys.
*  What do you think? Where do you guys think he is?
*  Points per game.
*  Guys who played 75 playoff games or more, what is his overall ranking against everybody in history?
*  I'm going to go top 10.
*  OK, ninth ninth.
*  What do you got, Rob?
*  That feels high for points per game.
*  I'm going to say.
*  Seventeenth.
*  He's fifth, fifth, twenty seven point seven points a game is in points per game.
*  Fifth.
*  How about rebounds? Where would you guys put him?
*  That's going to be high.
*  I'll go 15th for that.
*  OK, I'll take the over on that one.
*  I'm going to go ninth.
*  I Rob.
*  Oh, no, Rob.
*  Now you win it. He's 11th.
*  OK, 12.2 rebounds a game.
*  11th all time in the history of basketball.
*  Yeah, what are we playing?
*  Five games in assists.
*  Let's go assists.
*  Yeah. Where do you think he is for assists?
*  Is he like 75 plus games?
*  See, that one may be lower just by point guards racking them up.
*  But he's got to be he's got to still have some great playoff numbers.
*  I'm going to say I'm going to say 50 total assists or points or assists per game.
*  Assists per game.
*  Oh, I'm going to go like I'm going to go like six.
*  I'm going to say 15.
*  Rob barely wins out into 11th.
*  OK, so he's fifth, 11th and 11th in the three most important categories.
*  What do I win, by the way?
*  Is this like an OKC twenty five thousand dollar shot situation?
*  Everyone's respect on this live show.
*  Oh, LeBron James, LeBron James fourth in points.
*  Twenty eight point four, thirty seventh in rebounds, 13th in assists.
*  So he's behind Jokic and two of the three.
*  Larry Bird, 17th in points, 28 rebounds, 18th assists.
*  Well behind Jokic.
*  Janis better than I expected.
*  He's eighth in points, 13th in rebounds and 32nd in assists.
*  Wow. And then Magic Johnson, 50th in points, 53rd in rebounds, first in assists.
*  So the only guys who are in the top 30 in all three categories,
*  75 plus games or more, Jokic, LeBron and Bird and Jokic is convincingly ahead
*  of both guys in this. He is one of the craziest.
*  There's all these different lists you can make where it's like, how many guys?
*  Seventy five plus games, 20, 10 and three.
*  It's like 10. He's on that list.
*  How about 24 and 10?
*  There's like eight guys who did that.
*  What about just 19, six and six?
*  There's like six guys that did that.
*  Him as a playoff guy, I feel like is actually underrated
*  because we're watching it in real time.
*  And one of the great things about him in big games, he always delivers.
*  So I don't know that like, do those stats seem crazy
*  or do you feel like it's a little like, you know, what are the ideas?
*  Baseball when the home run started taking off and it becomes harder to judge
*  because we have more offense now.
*  I was just going to say that the cool thing about watching him
*  and the cool thing about getting that historical context is that his game
*  doesn't feel cheap at all.
*  Like he's basically playing and you could play in 1984.
*  You could play in 1994 and he could play now,
*  you know, whether or not like Rashid Wallace agrees.
*  I don't know. But like, I mean, I'm just it just seems like he's got a timeless game.
*  Bob Ryan was on Rossello talking about how like he's just a basketball player.
*  He's not the greatest athlete.
*  He's not the greatest this that or the other, but he is a master basketball player.
*  And I think that's what's cool is he's not doing this by also throwing up
*  21 threes a game or something like in like that.
*  This is all coming out of like his weird junk ball that works for him.
*  Yeah, I mean, I think he does well is something that works well in every era
*  of basketball, to your point, Chris, which is he solves problems.
*  And that's what makes him so scary in a game seven.
*  It's what's made him so scary from the first time he got to the playoffs
*  where he was putting up basically near triple doubles right off the bat.
*  So Ant had 27 today.
*  And in their wins, he had 40, 43, 27 and 27.
*  What do you have in their losses?
*  Nineteen, 44 and 18.
*  He is basically averaging 30 a game for the series.
*  Seems good. Is it is it reductive to say game seven comes down to
*  who has a better game and the Yoke Hitch?
*  Yes, yes, it is.
*  Well, it's all right. So why?
*  Well, I think we've we've circled so many of these other guys on both sides, right?
*  Like in a lot of ways, the Nuggets do go as Jamal Murray goes.
*  And the Wolves can be very fallible when they don't have Mike Conley.
*  And so, yes, a lot of pressure is gathering around both of those stars.
*  And I think these last two games have been great opportunities
*  for both of them to answer their respective moments.
*  Right. Yoke Hitch gets his MVP, has an absolute monster game, indisputable.
*  Ant gets trapped and taken out by the Nuggets.
*  Ant gets trapped and taken out of game five in a lot of ways, comes back.
*  I think he had 19 points in his first 15 minutes of this game, just right out,
*  right out of the gate. It was so clear he had a better hold on how to attack Denver's defense.
*  But you don't get to do that stuff if the rest of the team isn't working,
*  especially if you're Ant.
*  You're not getting the ball in the right spots to beat the trap and beat the double.
*  If the rest of your team isn't is included on how to do that.
*  Chris, can you give us your favorite forced media narratives from the series so far?
*  It feels like we've had more than usual.
*  This one's definitely started to create some. I think that the imaginary group of people who
*  are Ant Yoke Hitch, I think that there's four or three.
*  One of them is Justin Verrier, unfortunately.
*  But I think even he is... I think there's a degree to which that's a bit.
*  And there's also a Justin's just like, do we have to crown Denver now in February or whatever?
*  What a curmudgeon that guy is. Jesus.
*  How do you live with him, Rob?
*  I think we're trying to bring him out of his shell.
*  The Go Bear versus Yoke Hitch thing.
*  Nobody believes in Yoke Hitch piece. What else is there?
*  Well, I thought...
*  Oh, I love the like, is the real problem with Minnesota that Chris Finch can't walk the
*  sidelines? That's a good one.
*  How about the subplot, the sub take on that, which is why can't Chris Finch
*  walk the sidelines?
*  Because he's an older man who tore his knee.
*  How about I just put one of those arm crutches and fucking suck it up?
*  Where's that? Who's going to make that take?
*  Why not get a bunch of guys to lift him up in like a kind of a chair?
*  Yeah, like one of those scooters with like that holds his leg and he just
*  scoots around to yell at the refs.
*  I think from a Minnesota standpoint, Towns has been a fun one that nobody's really kind
*  of unlocked the right awesome Carl Anthony Towns take.
*  I mean, he still does some of the dumbest things that any good player does.
*  I thought he was really good tonight.
*  He flexed on them though, towards the end of the game.
*  And I was just like, just take it down.
*  Just like one.
*  He can't. He's only got one volume.
*  That's the thing.
*  He can't. He's like the... Yeah, he can't help himself.
*  That's it? That's all you got for narrative CR?
*  Because I have a game we're about to play here.
*  So get your narratives out now.
*  Okay, let's play the game and I'll try and dial some more up then.
*  Game seven legacy check.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Let's have a draft.
*  Yeah. Reggie Jackson's first overall.
*  CR, I'll give you first pick.
*  Game seven legacy.
*  Most at stake.
*  Who do you have?
*  I think it's...
*  I think I'm going to go go bear.
*  Go bear. Interesting. Why?
*  Because I think Ant and Jokic are fine either way.
*  There's no way you're going to be like if Jokic loses,
*  it's not going to be like this guy's fake.
*  Like this guy doesn't actually have it.
*  Ant is 22, ascendant.
*  Everybody loves him.
*  People are talking about him like he's Jordan.
*  It seems like it's going to go in that direction.
*  Yeah, like he already won.
*  Kat, I don't really think it's like a legacy situation.
*  I think it's like, are you actually like an all-star level player?
*  And can you stay on the floor in big situations?
*  So you just get down to like they mortgaged the farm for this go bear trade.
*  They've both looked like the dumbest move ever.
*  And then maybe the smartest move ever.
*  And that it was just Utah didn't know how to use Rudy Gobert.
*  And to be fair, I don't think he's been getting played off the floor
*  like he has in past post seasons.
*  This is just a matter of coming up against an immovable object in Jokic.
*  So I think that Gobert, who has become now under the microscope of like,
*  you got worked in game five and like you're not defensive player of the year.
*  I think it kind of like this is a little bit of a make or break game seven for him.
*  How about that?
*  I'm going to say that Gobert thing,
*  which I thought was mostly a complete overreaction by people.
*  It did lead to Draymond comparing himself how well he did against Jokic,
*  which is just easily irrefutable.
*  Plus anyone who watched any of those games.
*  Look, man, we all come back to the Warriors with some crazy ideas.
*  Jokic literally owns the Warriors.
*  I just thought that was nuts.
*  Everybody was kind of like, okay, dude.
*  All right.
*  What do you have for so Gobert is off the board, Rob.
*  Yep.
*  Who do you have?
*  Number two draft pick legacy at stake game seven.
*  Glenn Taylor slash A-Rod.
*  Are they are they draftable?
*  Minnesota.
*  They are 100% draftable.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, one way or the other,
*  one of those groups is not going to be owning the Timberwolves for the first year.
*  I'd like to know what is Glenn because Glenn Taylor was courtside game
*  for I think he was he was courtside.
*  I don't I haven't really seen him a ton,
*  but I wonder if there's like he's the he's like the bad luck omen or something like that.
*  Like there's something.
*  Donald Sterling.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, there's something like that, like it's it to it.
*  I don't know if he was there tonight, but.
*  I think A-Rod was out there tonight, right?
*  I thought they showed him courtside.
*  I don't know who what the jurisdiction is on that.
*  Who's allowed to sit where and I don't think they do either.
*  That's sort of the problem.
*  It's super awkward.
*  All right.
*  But I have my legacy pick.
*  I agree that it's too early for Yocage Orient.
*  Yes.
*  Although I will say if one of them has an absolutely abominable game,
*  I do think that would be a talking point the next day.
*  But back to back nuggets, I think would be my pick
*  because if they, you know, defending the title around to come back from 2-0.
*  At one point there, 19 to 1 odds to win the title that drops.
*  Then they rally back three straight games in a row.
*  The ship has been righted.
*  They lose game six.
*  Okay.
*  And then if they lose game seven at home, that's just a weird one.
*  It's, you know, I, I say this all the time.
*  Title defenses have to be part of a championship, at least a little bit.
*  And losing a game seven at home the year after you win the title,
*  when you have a healthy team, that's, that's not a great one.
*  So I'll go there.
*  What do you got next year?
*  It's 18 para to get you to go back to a,
*  can I give legal advice of how you see better when you win the title?
*  Don't go from.
*  Yeah.
*  Don't go for色 tonight you're hearing some blows B fro misinformation right.
*  I told Scott, I told Scott, I told Scott to go to the campaign of
*  Let's do, let's go.
*  Undefeated.
*  Great to hear.
*  work at the New York Times. I would say Kat is next because Kat is like if he has a terrible
*  game seven, does that also make it he's toxic waste to like whatever team might go for him?
*  You know, like how many suitors are there for him if it's just like, you know, this
*  is a guy who's going to like fill it up offensively in the regular season, but he's going to do
*  nine boneheaded things a year, including like lose you a playoff game when everything's
*  on the line.
*  With all due respect, nine a year seems incredibly generous.
*  Yeah, that would be that would be in maturity.
*  Yeah. But we're not talking about the other side of it, too, which is what if Kat has an amazing
*  game or just the idea that a team with Carl Anthony Towns is a critical component, a guy who
*  has been criticized for his temperament like we are here for the particulars of his game and
*  what he is and he isn't.
*  And you beat the defending champions to get to the Western Conference finals.
*  That's a that's a huge moment for Kat.
*  Yeah. And also when he, you know, when it unravels for him in games.
*  You do get the sense like it's.
*  Minnesota is the Thanksgiving dinner table where everything's going fine and then Uncle
*  Bobby has his second, second glass of wine as well.
*  Oh, no. And everybody gets a little tense because Towns is unraveling.
*  Put the down.
*  Jay McDaniels is hurling forks across the room.
*  Yeah, I like the Jamie Lee Curtis for analogy.
*  I think with Towns, he's out of anybody in this game on either end.
*  If you were like somebody is going to absolutely shit the bed in the biggest possible
*  way and be the biggest reason their team loses, what's going to happen to that person this
*  summer? He's probably the one that would become the trade bait person, right?
*  If he just stunk in a game seven.
*  I don't really think Denver has anybody that could suck in a game seven and cause.
*  I feel like Porter has seeded whatever claim he had to being the third
*  guy on that team to Gordon pretty.
*  Yes, like completely now.
*  So you're almost like happy with what you get from Porter.
*  Kat can go out on Sunday and get two fouls in five minutes.
*  And like the whole thing is on till, you know, he's fouling Yokeage 70 feet from the
*  basket. That's in play.
*  I'm going to full court press your kitchen and and pick up two quick fouls.
*  And it just throws their whole rotation off.
*  I think that both of these teams are really finely balanced, but like it can tilt,
*  right? Like if Jamal Murray is out, if Mike Conley is out, like something here can
*  happen. And if Kat gets into foul trouble or Kat starts flipping out at the refs and
*  and he's lagging behind on getting back on defense and all the things that we've seen
*  that are possible, I think that could spell real trouble for them.
*  I think the cat conversation is interesting because you have to have it if you lose,
*  right? You have to at least consider what your team could look like with a different
*  kind of quasi star player or star player in that spot.
*  But I don't know how you come out of this nugget series, win or lose, and think Kat
*  wasn't essential to what we are trying to do.
*  And I think the way Gobert guards Yokeage is a key part of that.
*  I don't know how you would come to the conclusion that that guy is someone you can
*  afford to lose if Gobert is going to get absolutely cooked in that one on one matchup.
*  And even if Denver does bow out early, they're going to be around.
*  You're going to have to keep going against and through these guys at some point or
*  another in the playoffs for the foreseeable future.
*  And clearly, Towns is a big way in which you battle with them.
*  Yeah. And I guess also, I don't know if GMs do this.
*  I don't know if if coaching staffs do this, but like if you re simulate this Western
*  Conference playoffs in Minnesota draws a different path to the conference finals,
*  right? They don't play Denver in the second round and maybe they're in this Thunder
*  Dallas series in some capacity like, you know, Denver was Minnesota is obviously
*  built to defeat Denver, but Denver is still the team that they had to get built to
*  defeat. So I wonder whether or not if you're Minnesota, you're like, hey, it's not
*  going to happen overnight.
*  We may have to take a couple of swings at this before we knock them off their perch.
*  You Towns is a 50, 50, 80 guy in the playoffs.
*  It's been really good for them.
*  Oh, yeah. And I got to say, as somebody who doesn't really care either way, like
*  what happens in this series, I'm going to have some different bets, but I find myself
*  rooting for Towns.
*  And I can't really explain it because to me, he's one of the most frustrating players
*  in the league. I've certainly made fun of him a bunch on this podcast.
*  I don't really have high expectations for him to come through in big
*  games. I assume he's usually going to do something wrong, but there's so much
*  potential with him. He's also not a jerk.
*  It seems like a good guy.
*  That's the thing. I actually like like Towns.
*  I want him to figure it out.
*  But, you know, if I was going to give me two choices and one of them is he's going
*  to have three fouls with 10 minutes left in the second quarter, I'd probably it's
*  almost like you have to prove to me that's not you anymore.
*  So we'll see him.
*  I would say him and Murray are the most interesting non-stars for this game.
*  Seven. Who do you have for one more legacy pick, Rob?
*  Well, so is Murray off the board already?
*  He is not. I think I'm actually I think I'm actually going to go Porter because
*  I think if Murray has a bad series or continues to have a bad series in a lot of
*  ways. His reputation in the playoffs, he's hit clutch shots, he's hit game winners,
*  he's come up in basically every big moment prior to this that you could expect a
*  guy to come up.
*  And so there is some some bulletproof armor with that.
*  Michael Porter Jr. makes what, 40 million dollars.
*  He was not good in the NBA finals last year, not saying he wasn't good
*  throughout the playoff run.
*  I'm not saying he didn't have great individual games, but he's proven to be the
*  kind of guy who can edge into three point specialization to a degree that is
*  detrimental to the Nuggets.
*  If he's not a big time rebounder, if he's not getting after it on defense and he's
*  just this guy that we saw in this game.
*  Maybe that's not a player that hangs around Denver in the long term versus I
*  have a hard time seeing any like team building consequences for Jamal Murray.
*  He's a like a critical part of what they're doing there.
*  Michael Porter Jr.
*  If Christian Brown is finishing games over him, then maybe he is not the
*  solution and maybe he's the movable piece.
*  So he's got 35, 36 million next year, 38 and then 40.8 CR.
*  The Nuggets called the Sixers and says, and say, let's let's play this out.
*  This is stupid, but terrible Porter game.
*  Start to worry about, wow, what we're paying for him.
*  Could we turn that into two guys?
*  And they call Philly and they say, we'll trade them into your cap space.
*  Give us some picks, whatever.
*  Like what it like?
*  I mean, you only have two players in your roster, CR.
*  I'm aware.
*  What is Porter's value in the league?
*  Cause like when we do the ringer top hundred, I think he's in like the
*  sixties or seventies for us, right?
*  Good player.
*  Yeah.
*  And I really get where, but it's expensive.
*  Most people probably I'm maybe I'm wrong in this assumption, but would you guys
*  all assume that if he had a higher usage rate, he'd also have like much better
*  numbers?
*  Like he does seem like the kind of guy.
*  Who can't tell it's like a Tobias thing.
*  Cause then when Tobias had the ball more, it was like, wow, Tobias, he's not
*  really in the offense if he had the ball more and then he had had to have the
*  ball more when a bead was out and it was the exact same production was actually
*  like worse, right?
*  He, he feels like a cav to me.
*  Cav a cav.
*  Yeah.
*  Like he feels like a let's trade my, our problem for your problem kind of guy.
*  Not a, Hey, the Sixers, we didn't get Paul George, but MPJ he's right there.
*  You know, like it feels more like a, we have to make some adjustments because
*  these guys can't stand each other anymore.
*  And by all accounts, like it doesn't seem like, I mean, for, for he's had a really
*  tough end of the season, obviously, but it doesn't seem like the nuggets guys
*  aren't like, no, it's not.
*  That's why the hypothetical is giddy situation where giddy is like, no, no,
*  the hell is going on.
*  I can't wait to talk about that.
*  Yeah.
*  The Porter thing, we're just saying like worst case scenarios for different
*  players in the game.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, that's really the only, you have to move by any means, not some, but that's
*  their move.
*  If they were like, man, we got a little, you know, this got stale fast.
*  We got to fix something.
*  Uh, my last legacy pick I'm going off the board guys, Mike and Norrie.
*  So if he beats Denver in a game seven, then I would assume they're the
*  favorite in the Western finals.
*  Does this become a Luke Walton 2016 situation where he did such a good job
*  as the interim guy, all of a sudden he's like our next Laker coach.
*  And then with it by December, we're getting little sub tweets and you know,
*  Shams writing like, uh, LeBron's already upset with Mike and Norrie right now.
*  It's the Lakers job is open.
*  We assume the calves job will probably be open after that.
*  You mean after the hit piece an hour after the series ended?
*  Yeah.
*  Are there any other openings?
*  Wizards, but they allegedly love the guy who was the interim coach last year.
*  I have no idea what.
*  Okay.
*  Uh, yeah, I was going to say this is funny.
*  It's funny that it's game seven and neither coaches it feel in any heat
*  because Finch obviously I'll just say this about Finch.
*  He's, he's obviously awesome.
*  If they have any kind of meltdown, I do think he takes a little bit of heat for it.
*  If it's like, man, they lost their heads in game seven.
*  They were not ready for the spotlight.
*  Then it's like last year it was McDaniel's punching the wall and it just seemed
*  like they came apart again.
*  Like you're going to want, like, I don't think that they need Tibbs out there.
*  And they had Tibbs, they had that experience, but you wonder whether I'm
*  literally, this is my last pick of the legacy draft.
*  I'm not saying I actually believe this, but it's interesting to be going into
*  this and not have either coach really under any kind of scrutiny.
*  I would say they're Rob, wouldn't you say these are two of the five probably
*  safest coaches right now, these two spolstra Steve Kurt just got a huge contract.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, I mean, the Celtics are 72 and 20 and I don't wouldn't say the coach is safe.
*  Tibbito maybe, but he's got a year left in his deal and they haven't resigned
*  him yet, which I think is pretty entrenched.
*  Pretty long.
*  He'd got an extension.
*  So he's there.
*  I mean, there's the, the list is less than eight.
*  I would say Dagnall's probably in that category.
*  Yeah, that's a good one.
*  Are we sure bud is safe?
*  But, but it's already unsafe.
*  We're already on bud watch.
*  Yeah.
*  Nick nurse, I guess is safe.
*  Yeah, he's safe.
*  Yeah.
*  But, and Finch has been impressive in terms of how much he's proven with this
*  team so quickly, how he's been able to get everyone on the same page.
*  It is interesting that neither coach in a C like a series is this big would take
*  heat Chris, but maybe we need to be pointing the fingers at look teammate of the year
*  perhaps, but Mike Conley torpedoing Chris Finch's knee, maybe that affects the
*  real legacy.
*  Oh, I like that.
*  I like that.
*  The ultimate coach killer, Mike Conley, who would have guessed?
*  I had one more legacy pick altitude.
*  Altitude is supposed to be this huge advantage of Minnesota walks in game seven.
*  It's like, do I believe in altitude anymore?
*  I don't know.
*  Is this apex mountain for altitude?
*  Could be or they're near deer mountain.
*  I know.
*  I don't want to make predictions or I don't know if you want to make predictions
*  for someone to do that right now.
*  Do you think that if Minnesota is going to win, it's going to be.
*  They they they jump them and it happens in like the first half, basically in
*  Minnesota is just like we have more energy.
*  We're more up for this.
*  We're we're ready to eat you guys alive and they they open up some kind of lead
*  that they protect.
*  Or do you think that this is a nail biter?
*  Well, hasn't that been the pattern with the Denver that you got to catch him in
*  the first quarter?
*  Basically, Minnesota wins have all been like about the Laker series where they
*  had the lead, I think in four of the five games, they're up by like 10 in the first
*  half, I think in four of them.
*  So Denver, for some reason, is a slow burn.
*  So you're right.
*  They have to come out there with the same defense they had tonight.
*  And to me, it's McDaniels and Nas are the two guys that when they're out, like at
*  mid court and their arms are flying around and they're doing that whole thing.
*  If they're going to rig the game, who do you think they would rig the game for?
*  Sierra?
*  I think the league want to.
*  I think they want Joker in the Western Conference finals.
*  I think Joker against Luca.
*  Joker, Luca would be there.
*  Oh, I mean, and and in the conference finals, I would say I think and I think
*  there's a nice little ant run they could have here leading into the Olympics.
*  Yeah, I the three three time MVP being in the conference finals when LeBron and
*  Katie and Steph are all out, I think having a guy with that kind of silverware
*  is if I was going to rig the game, I'd probably put Joker in there.
*  It's not a bad thing.
*  I was confused the other day when Gobert got fined for the the money gesture
*  after the call, it's like what money is changing hands in favor of right?
*  I the mechanics of that were a little lost on me.
*  Well, Tatum's gotten eight technicals this year by just waving his hand like that.
*  So I still can't figure out technicals and fines at all.
*  They got thrown out this year for just waving at the rep.
*  Oh, wait, give me one more legacy pick.
*  I forgot. Yeah. Heating pads.
*  Oh, oh, but legacy pick for the the the ghost suspension for the for the like,
*  if Denver wins, you can always just be like that can go into the.
*  Yeah, that goes into the Amari boat.
*  You Mario. Yeah.
*  The dream on punch hall fame.
*  It's going to be living on the Internet, on Reddit, on Twitter forever.
*  That is the argument fodder.
*  This series really needed was why didn't Jamal Murray get suspended?
*  I think you were talking about this on.
*  I don't know if you were talking about with Termini or on Sunday, Bill,
*  but you guys were just like you were talking about the heating pad thing.
*  You're like somebody could have slipped.
*  You know, cat could have just absolutely he could have fallen.
*  It's like, all right, these guys are professional athletes.
*  They have a heating pad.
*  You know, I don't know.
*  Those things are slippery.
*  Step on them. You're like a ghost sideways. Yeah.
*  Rob, where did you stand on that? I never got your take.
*  I know you talked about it probably in Ringer and B.A., but did you
*  did you have and I can't believe he didn't get suspended?
*  Take or did you not care?
*  I mean, I certainly would prefer he not get suspended.
*  I don't want anyone. Well, all of us do. Yeah.
*  I wouldn't have blamed the league office if they had.
*  And I think most importantly, for a player in Jamal Murray,
*  I have a ton of respect for and who battles as hard as anybody on the floor.
*  Just losers shit, frankly. Yeah.
*  Like not what you would expect from a Nuggets team that has not lost
*  its composure in previous series and previous matchups.
*  And I think that kind of feeds into what you were saying, Chris,
*  about the Timberwolves, if they do kind of punch the Nuggets in the mouth up front.
*  This is the one opponent the Nuggets have lost their cool against.
*  And they haven't really been able to battle back in the same way
*  they were against the Lakers.
*  They kind of seem to know that if they get down early,
*  it can get away from them so quickly.
*  And for whatever that does to the Nuggets, psychologically,
*  Jamal Murray is a critical part of it.
*  Chris prediction.
*  Minnesotan yet? Yeah, I'm going to go Minnesota.
*  Minnesota. Interesting.
*  I like the fact that they know they can win in Denver.
*  They know they can beat this team two times in a row.
*  I think that even though you could make the argument
*  that those guys were like, this was our championship, was to roll up the score in game six.
*  I think that they have to be feeling better about themselves going into game seven.
*  And I I don't know. I like their chances.
*  I just think that, like, if they've got Conley, I like their chances.
*  They're plus five underdogs in game seven on Fandel.
*  What do you what do you think, Rob?
*  I think Nuggets by a little bit more than that, but maybe like nine.
*  And I think we're due for an excellent Jamal Murray game.
*  I don't think there's any evidence on the court to suggest we are headed there.
*  But just by the timing, it just kind of feels like it's going to be one of his moments.
*  And I can't wait to see what he comes up with.
*  I would lean Denver, obviously, their favorite, but
*  I just trust their infrastructure and I trust more guys than their team in a game seven.
*  And I've talked about this over and over again in this podcast, those game sevens,
*  those that list of guys you trust.
*  It just starts going sideways, right?
*  It's like, oh, Jada McDaniel, they just left them wide open in the corner
*  and he didn't want to shoot. Fuck. Right.
*  It's Kyle Anderson comes in and airballs the three.
*  And all of a sudden you have four guys you can trust in a game seven.
*  Denver, you know, I trust the four starters
*  because of some of the situations they were in last year.
*  I don't think Reggie Jackson is scared at all.
*  I actually weirdly trust Christian Brown.
*  Yeah, I don't know why, but at home and I think the home will help
*  some of their younger guys, but I probably trust maybe they're not going to play
*  that many guys either, right? Like they're not.
*  I think we play play six, seven guys.
*  Yeah, there's things with Minnesota that like if you're betting on them,
*  you're betting big bucks on them.
*  And during a game, you bet on one of the two teams.
*  You're like, God, why don't I do that?
*  I think just trusting towns in a giant game.
*  We haven't had a lot of evidence that that's a good idea.
*  McDaniel's is shooting their bench just in general.
*  And who you're still betting on a 22 year old guy
*  who's going to want to be the hero of a game.
*  Can he calm himself down?
*  Can he just find the angles?
*  Can he play like he did in game four, basically?
*  But in a game seven, there's just not a lot of evidence that
*  if you're trusting a young player and some of the variables they have,
*  that that comes through.
*  With all that said, they might come out and just be, you know,
*  it could be Hagler-Herns and they're just flying around.
*  I think how the game is going to be called is going to really matter,
*  especially in this one.
*  What do you say, Sierra?
*  No, I was just going to like the whole theme of this Minnesota run is like
*  everybody going on their pods after and be like, is this really happening?
*  Yeah. Is this ant thing?
*  Is this happening? Like we've been.
*  And this is we get to see a guard do this.
*  And like, what if this is his first game seven?
*  Well, easily in this stage, I can't remember if he had one before, but
*  I think this is what if he comes out?
*  He has like a he's just a signature like, yeah, it's me, dudes, like game.
*  I just I can't wait for that.
*  I fully expect it on me there because the honestly the difference
*  between him having like a 19 point, like not so great,
*  but still like at the end of the day, decent game and scoring 40
*  could be the difference in the game itself.
*  Yeah. One thing, by the way, I was going to say this is nothing, but.
*  Holiday was over five and Reggie Jackson was over six tonight
*  and those bench guys that you need coming off where they literally
*  could have make a shot, it would make you a little nervous.
*  Go ahead. Yeah.
*  Well, and that's one area where the game seven minutes will
*  whatever bench guys are not working, will not play.
*  And I thought I thought this was a game where Yokech
*  probably could have gone for 45 minutes if the game had been close.
*  But there was just no opportunity to do that.
*  I think what's worth noting is that the series where teams do come back
*  from down to a lot of them are seven.
*  They're they're winning seven situations.
*  And those aren't usually home teams.
*  You know, the higher seeded teams winning out of the gate.
*  But there's going to be some hiccup along the way.
*  Winning four straight is almost impossible to do in these competitive circumstances.
*  So it's kind of still fitting the playbook.
*  If Denver is going to win this thing that, yeah, it was going to be seven.
*  It wasn't going to be six in Minnesota.
*  We're going to take one more break on the podcast,
*  but we're going to stay here on YouTube.
*  All right, we got to hit the other two series just really quick.
*  OKC Dallas.
*  I still feel like OKC might be a better team and they're just not making threes.
*  I know that's like a crazy take because that's part of its basketball.
*  You know, you're not making shots, you don't deserve to win.
*  But I watched them all year.
*  I know you did, Rob. I know you did, Chris.
*  All the shots that they made during the season just stopped going in three, four games ago.
*  I don't understand what happened to Jalen Williams, like Isaiah Joe yesterday.
*  They tried to get him going. He can't make a shot.
*  I just kind of find it hard to believe that they're just going to stop shooting well.
*  Like, that's it.
*  It just their season ended for shooting well 10 days ago.
*  And that's that.
*  Meanwhile, Dallas, I think, has.
*  Kind of kind of shot above their
*  we kicked above their weight with their with their with their role players, certainly.
*  Yeah, yes.
*  Luca's been pretty up and down from three, but I mean, but P.J.
*  Washington and like, yeah, yeah, you're so Ellis now.
*  You're like, that's it's pretty wild.
*  Yeah, he's 50 percent from three.
*  Is he ever he averaged 10 and five last round.
*  So. I want to say that Dallas has figured out, OKC,
*  Luca figured out some sort of Zen thing about he somebody
*  probably showed him a montage of all the times he pitched a cause like, hey, man,
*  this is what you look like.
*  He clearly was making an effort to have like a better demeanor
*  and just, you know, slow down and be happier.
*  But I don't think I don't think Oklahoma City can play this bad again.
*  And if they do, I'm happy to be wrong.
*  It's still my meet Dallas beat them.
*  But Rob, you watched them all year.
*  Yeah, this does not look like OKC.
*  And I don't really know what happened.
*  And I'm not going to credit the Dallas defense because I thought
*  they missed a lot of wide open shots.
*  I think you should credit the Dallas defense some they played really well.
*  And some is fine.
*  Here's the thing.
*  Dallas's interior defense has been great to the point that is
*  it is pressurized all of those three point attempts,
*  because that's on a lot of these possessions, the only thing that thunder
*  have going, it's either Shea in isolation and he's been able to get to his stuff.
*  But when they fire the ball around, it's basically threes or bust.
*  And you would think, I agree, this is the best three point
*  percentage team in the regular season.
*  You expect them to hit more than I think it was about a quarter of their shots.
*  Right. That's three straight games, inexplicable.
*  But sometimes the playoffs are inexplicable.
*  And it's one of those things causally, where when the young team does that,
*  we look at it and say, are they a little nervous?
*  Are those moments a little big for guys who haven't been there before?
*  The one case in which I do think there's some truth to that is Jalen Williams,
*  who by my eye just looks a little tentative
*  in those kind of 50 50 should I attack or should I swing the ball kinds of situations?
*  And when you're a playoff killer, you go for it.
*  And when you're a young guy trying to figure it out,
*  sometimes you just kind of let the ball in the moment go by you.
*  And I think he's had a couple too many of those, which isn't a detriment.
*  But just to say he's a young guy who's on his arc and he's having to learn
*  these lessons in real time against a Mavericks team that's been pretty ruthless.
*  Yeah. And Dallas's role player guys all seem to be having career series
*  where Oklahoma's role players seem to be like waking a little bit.
*  I mean, they've been decent and like there's there's a shea game out there
*  that could definitely rear its head next.
*  But I feel like Dallas has two of the three best players in the series
*  and seems to have a balance.
*  And they know what they're going to do every time they go down the floor.
*  And I sometimes feel like when Oklahoma City is coming down the floor,
*  I'm like, I have no idea what you guys are going to do.
*  Is this going to be shea one on five?
*  Is this going to be swing it to the guy who you really don't want
*  taking that three like Giddy or Dort or whatever?
*  Like it doesn't feel like the ball winds up where they want it to.
*  Whereas Dallas, it's either Luka or Kyrie
*  creating their own shot or a wide open three for the hottest dude in the world.
*  Right now. I thought she was getting everywhere.
*  He wanted the second half of the game
*  and either he would shoot or he would just find somebody for a wide open three.
*  I liked all the shots they got.
*  I know. And they just didn't go in.
*  And that's so if I'm OK, see, I'm super encouraged by that.
*  The Jalen Williams thing is the most terrifying piece
*  because we watched him all year.
*  That guy was fucking awesome.
*  And I'm with you.
*  I mean, Dallas is definitely tilting their defense toward him.
*  They're trying to make him make quick decisions, but it doesn't explain his three.
*  He was one of the 10 best three point shooters in the league.
*  Yeah. And now a low volume guy.
*  You know, he didn't want to take a lot of threes.
*  And that moment where Dallas dares you to do it, to beat the rotation,
*  he just doesn't have that that quick fire kind of urgency in him right now. Right.
*  So that's I feel like they can fix that.
*  The thing that really scares me for them.
*  There's just so many times where you just don't feel like they're getting
*  the big rebound in Dallas over and over again, was getting these offensive
*  rebounds or these tap outs on them.
*  And when they're trying to get stops and they'll get the stop
*  and then they can't get the rebound because they're not big enough.
*  And I really think like, you know, I'm not the first person to make this point,
*  but I made the point of the trade deadline.
*  I they went into the playoffs thinking that the other Jalen Williams
*  could be their backup big.
*  And I don't think he's big enough.
*  And they just feel really small in this series in a way that I think
*  Dallas has exposed, ironically, with one of the people being Gafford,
*  who I think, OK, so you could have trumped them in a trade.
*  But it just it feels like over and over again, they just can't get that one rebound.
*  How many times has Dallas
*  batted a ball back where Luca gets it and either makes a 28 footer
*  or throws in the quarter to P.J. Washington for a wide open three?
*  And that's like I felt like that was the difference last night.
*  It was like three threes that OKC missed three plays where Dallas got a rebound
*  and then a basket after that.
*  And it was just like six plays was the difference.
*  But I feel like OKC can play with this team.
*  And I think they're going to be super disappointed if they don't win this.
*  Do you guys think Gafford is the single most texted about player
*  by other NBA team fan bases being like, we could we have had this guy?
*  Like, what the hell?
*  Like the Lakers, all my sisters, friends.
*  I'm like, so wait, we've been doing the Andre Drummond,
*  like rotating cast of of dead centers now.
*  And like Gafford was out there like this guy looks incredible.
*  Maybe this is what OKC should be doing is every trade deadline
*  with all these picks that they have just trade for the guy
*  you think might hurt your team so that somebody else doesn't get him.
*  And then even if you're not going to play him,
*  just very much.
*  Daniel Gafford, enjoy a ruba wherever you want to go have fun.
*  But you're not going to be on the team.
*  We're going to play because that's that's been really
*  come out of the equation. Yeah.
*  Well, I wonder why they thought
*  they must have talked about him, right?
*  They could have trumped any offer Dallas had.
*  I wonder what made them think they were good.
*  Like, did they think we're not ready this year?
*  You're you're we're a year away.
*  That means I'm so committed.
*  We're so committed to the smaller lineup
*  and all these guys who who can either shoot, pass, drive.
*  And that's just who we are.
*  And we don't want to bring a center into that.
*  I can't figure out why they didn't do it.
*  I mean, they were the number one seed
*  in one of the youngest teams in the league.
*  I think there's reason for them to feel good about where they were.
*  But did you feel going in the playoffs that this wasn't going to hurt them
*  at some point, not being big enough?
*  It felt like it could, for sure.
*  It was the thing that we were all circling.
*  But I thought there was a possibility they could play through it.
*  And frankly, there's still a possibility they can play through it.
*  They're not out of this series yet.
*  Not next round, though.
*  I mean, that would be tough.
*  Like, if it's not now, it's going to be next round.
*  Whoever they wind up playing.
*  I thought they were going to win this series.
*  I don't feel bad about the pick.
*  And I'm still the thing about three pointers is they can veer the other way.
*  And all of a sudden you go 18 for 40 and now there's a game seven.
*  OK, see. But the thing is, Luca, I would say, is in the top three
*  least afraid of a game seven in somebody else's house.
*  And I think Kyrie might be in the top three as well.
*  Yeah, maybe.
*  I mean, those are two guys who like some of the biggest plays
*  in game seven history in, you know, opposing arenas,
*  just absolutely brutal stuff from them in terms of ripping teams hearts out.
*  But I hear you on all this and especially on the size thing.
*  I think something that factors into that, whether they have other bigs or not,
*  if Chet is going to be your five, you're starting five.
*  You have to find ways for him to actually be involved
*  in the main mechanisms of the offense.
*  And where he's not just the guy who forces the switch and then stands off
*  to the side, that's not that's not enough from that spot.
*  If this is what it's going to give you.
*  It sounds like you're counting out, OK, see, I feel defeat in your voice.
*  I think Dallas is better than them in this series.
*  I don't know if in totality, Dallas is better than Oklahoma City,
*  like over the course of a season and in any other series.
*  But like I Dallas knows exactly what they're doing.
*  And I think Oklahoma City is still trying to figure out what to do against Dallas.
*  That's what it feels like.
*  Like Oklahoma City, they have a distinct style and they've been great
*  about kind of sticking to their principles all year.
*  But within possessions, they feel like they're searching
*  versus Luca feels like he's diagnosing throw and no look lobs. Right.
*  There's just a difference in the decision making and in the processing
*  that's going on behind some of these plays that I do think Dallas is going to win.
*  And I was with you up front, but I thought OKC was going to advance out of this series.
*  I felt I felt really good about their chances here.
*  But the Mavs have had their number.
*  And I think the physicality and the size have been an inarguable part of that.
*  So we got to mention the giddy piece,
*  because if you're making the case for Dallas to close it out, part of it is
*  OKC feels a little off.
*  And it's because of this giddy part.
*  Giddy was a huge part of the team the last couple of years, especially last year.
*  They had really figured out the the yin yang with him and SGA.
*  And he had the ball enough.
*  And, you know, it was just a super competitive guy who big rebounder for them to.
*  Yeah, he just was a winning player.
*  That's the best way I'd put it.
*  Had some off the court stuff that was well documented,
*  lost his confidence a little, SGA ascended.
*  And they never totally figured out the giddy part.
*  Chris, talk about what we were talking about today.
*  It just I just noticed that when the thunder of one
*  the giddy is not in those group interviews.
*  Not now. Now, I'm not necessarily like deducing anything from that.
*  But like, he just seems apart from the team.
*  Well, and then we also heard like that even in the locker room.
*  He's the first guy out.
*  And it just seems like they're headed for he will not be on the team.
*  He's up for an extension.
*  You know, they've been yanking his minutes around.
*  They finally benched him for the first time in a couple of years
*  for the game yesterday, which was weird because it was the series was tied at two.
*  It wasn't like three one.
*  This is our last move.
*  Like that was strangely a narrative that emerged almost instantaneously
*  in this series was like the giddy minutes.
*  How can they play giddy?
*  When is giddy going to be in the new Andre Roberson?
*  Is giddy going to go back in?
*  You know, I think you could make the argument.
*  And I've seen this suggested that the thunder part of the reason
*  why they didn't make a trade for a big man at the at the deadline.
*  I don't really know what Hayward has given them.
*  But one of the reasons why they did what they did is they wanted to see this group
*  of guys in this kind of situation to properly evaluate the people that they had.
*  I don't mean to be stealing somebody's tweet, but that's basically like
*  the conventional wisdom.
*  And if that's the case, then this is you're getting your answer about giddy.
*  At least in this context or whatever is going on with him.
*  He's an incredibly useful NBA player, so I think he'll find success at some other stop.
*  But it does seem like he's it's like if you're a game,
*  your game six of this series and you're still trying to figure out
*  what to do with giddy, that's not a great sign.
*  It should either be like we can't play giddy this series and he's out
*  or whatever it is.
*  But like we're starting him, but he's not coming out in the second half.
*  But we might put him in spot for like in the late third quarter
*  or early fourth quarter, fourth quarter.
*  It's not that's not working.
*  No, it's not working.
*  And yeah, the financial part of this being looped in makes it extra complicated.
*  Right. If this guy is not going to be a part of your future,
*  what do you do in terms of potentially extending or resigning?
*  Do you end up having to move him prematurely because of the financial deadlines?
*  Everything gets weird very quickly.
*  And you can see how the isolation or kind of him feeling apart
*  from the team could happen, because from his perspective,
*  going into what could be a potential contract here,
*  do you want to be in this weird liminal space role wise
*  where you're kind of starting or not starting or you're getting yanked out of games
*  where it's all very high profile in terms of what you can't do well?
*  And that could be a huge problem for him.
*  So I do think whether it's him or the rebounding from OKC's perspective,
*  when you are a young team, you want to get to the playoffs
*  and make sure that the problems you think you have are actually your problems.
*  And you kind of got to take it on the chin the first time,
*  especially when you when you're this young and you do want to get these guys experience.
*  But just just clarify that the thing that the thing that's been hanging over
*  you have you've been having nightmares about make sure that it's real
*  before you start making roster moves about it.
*  Yeah, I guess I would just say that as somebody
*  who's been on the other side of this with the Sixers
*  when they were young and full of promise,
*  they're saving great land.
*  I would say don't wait too long.
*  You know, yes, don't take don't don't have too many experimental post seasons
*  to get a sense of who you guys are.
*  You know, like Shay is Shay now and is a is a top five NBA player
*  and Chet's only going to get better,
*  presumably like Kason and Jaylen's like they're going to get better.
*  Like you've got so many picks and things to trade.
*  Don't wait. Like, don't don't be like, hey, we're we like we're at.
*  We're going to be competitive for the next five years.
*  Like these things don't come around every time
*  and you're going to blink your eyes and somebody is going to be 30.
*  Trust me. I love you using the Doris tents over and over again
*  with some of these guys. So really appreciate it.
*  The good news for OKC is they've never been in.
*  OKC has never been in a situation before where they had a young,
*  young contender with somebody coming up for a contract
*  who sucked in a playoff series and then they traded him over.
*  Oh, oh, no, that's exactly what happened.
*  James Harden, I should I can I feel a little different?
*  Can I redo that in the huby tents where I just use you the entire time?
*  You know, Oklahoma City.
*  OK, you're Oklahoma City.
*  You got a goody coming up for a contract extension.
*  So one of the things with Josh Giddy is they would have to make this move
*  basically in June next month, because once we get past July,
*  then it gets weird with if it's not a contract extension.
*  I forget that rules get complicated, especially if he does the
*  doesn't it get harder to trade him once like October 31st?
*  Once we're into that last season, you can't.
*  Once you don't agree on an extension, I think it gets harder
*  to trade somebody right. Am I imagining that?
*  Well, he wouldn't be on the qualifying offer.
*  He would still be in his fourth his fourth season.
*  Oh, yeah, you're right. I thought so.
*  Yeah. So the timing we were in lab on YouTube, we would have just cut that out.
*  And I'm fucked right now. I look like an idiot.
*  You're Bill Simmons. You got that wrong.
*  I'm Bill Simmons.
*  I said it was a great idea to go live.
*  Obviously not.
*  No, but they could trade him as somebody who could extend him.
*  Before this next season, I have some teams for you guys just for fun.
*  We're going to do the Giddy trade machine.
*  Yeah. The Rothko of the Giddy trade machine is here.
*  Number one with a bullet is San Antonio.
*  Absolutely. That's like the perfect Josh Giddy team.
*  Yeah. Do you see their point guards last year?
*  Didn't we just do this with Jeremy Sohan?
*  No, but he's he's an actual real weight guard.
*  He just has he can is a ball handler.
*  He is more of a he's more of a ball handler.
*  His court vision is better.
*  But to me, they're kind of variations of the same theme,
*  which is Giddy is a little more flow oriented on offense.
*  And so hands more of a defensive value.
*  Throw an entry pass.
*  Yes, I do think he could do that.
*  Is Josh Giddy worth more than the eighth pick in this horrendous draft?
*  Oh, I would need to be able to name eight people in this draft.
*  I cannot do that for you right now.
*  So I'm spurs.
*  I got Washington just because they need players all over the place.
*  He could help rebuild Jordan.
*  That sounds like an anybody who can pass in Washington, Utah.
*  I don't mind that.
*  Colin Sexton, Giddy Foundation is something.
*  Get a score off the bench.
*  Orlando, because they need another point guard who can't shoot.
*  Rude. That was a joke.
*  Atlanta, if they end up trading one or both of those guys and need a guard back.
*  And then I have heat culture.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Hmm. Competitive guy.
*  And then he's a competitive guy.
*  Or you just say like he is.
*  He was until this year, whatever the fuck happened.
*  And then the Philadelphia 76ers, just because you have two players in your roster.
*  Yeah. Bring him bring him on down.
*  I mean, look, he's he's he's definitely like a handy offensive playmaker.
*  I do love watching.
*  I'm pro giddy. I'm buying giddy.
*  I'm buying everyone else's giddy stock.
*  I think this is a weird situation because I think he's somebody that needs the ball a lot.
*  Derek White for giddy straight up.
*  God, no. God, no.
*  Derek White, one of the best two shaved heads decisions of the last year, him and Caruso.
*  Any other any other giddy teams before we move on to the next?
*  What about the Grizzlies?
*  You know, the healthier jaw coming back, like having him as an option on the three.
*  I don't think he's a full time one because of the same offensive
*  limitations they've been dealing with in Memphis for what seems like decades
*  now in terms of small forwards who can't shoot.
*  But having a small forward who could pass is a nice, you know, a nice, a nice
*  arrow to have in the quiver, so to speak.
*  It's interesting that you consider giddy a small forward.
*  I mean, is that I think you could make a case
*  he's like an Eric Snow type big guard, too, depending on who's on his team.
*  Do you think he can do that full time, though?
*  I think it is conspicuous that when the thunder
*  go to lineups without Shea and really all throughout the season,
*  it's been Jaydub, who's the guy who's kind of driving and orienting the offense.
*  And it's not giddy, even though I agree with you, some of the skill set
*  would lend itself to that.
*  But the fact that they don't see him as that guy is a bit of, you know,
*  it sets something off in my brain, maybe not a full on red, a yellow flag.
*  What are you expecting from Nick's Pacers, Rob? Game six.
*  I think the Pacers are going to win.
*  Well, yeah.
*  I think I think they're going to come back with, again, another weird yo
*  yoing energy series, but the Knicks do seem like they have to pick
*  their spots a little bit, just given the health you feel like this is going to be
*  a little bit of a cruise control Knicks game, and then they are like
*  all jacked up for seven.
*  I mean, I do think they are going to be jacked up for seven regardless.
*  I mean, I don't know if they have cruise control over there.
*  That may not really be in their in their makeup.
*  But I just think there are limitations that they're going to bump up against
*  with Indy on its home floor, with the way that some of their
*  role guys have played at home.
*  It feels like one of those series that's going back.
*  And from there, I love the Knicks chances.
*  I mean, I like New York regardless is the answer.
*  But I do think the Pacers are going to extend it.
*  I'll say this, Chris Ryan.
*  Mm hmm. They're playing Friday night.
*  If there's a game seven, it would be Sunday afternoon in New York.
*  You think that that's a little bit of an ice patch?
*  Yeah. Game for New York.
*  No, that's a really rough one for New York.
*  They're playing every other day, every way.
*  But let's say they go all out and they lose game six by five.
*  You know, but it was everyone plays 40 plus minutes who matters for them.
*  And then they got to run it back 36 hours later.
*  That's probably better for the team with the young legs.
*  But I would never trust Indiana to game seven after what we watched in game.
*  I know the Halliburton thing.
*  The deer in the headlights routine.
*  Talk about legacy games. That was that was tough.
*  But there's an interesting Celtics wrinkle with this, where if the Knicks
*  somehow win game six in Indy, they need they would need a game seven
*  for for that spot if the OKC Dallas series ends.
*  Oh, no, wait a second.
*  Yeah, I can't remember what the variable schedule is for the East.
*  If it ends early, I got to look this up.
*  See, this is why we edit podcasts sometimes.
*  Saturday. Oh, yes.
*  Saturday is Thunder Mavs.
*  Oh, no. So we're good now.
*  So originally, if the if the Timberwolves lost tonight
*  and the next Pacers won, then that game would have been no.
*  I still think it's I still think it's Sunday for game seven.
*  Yeah, it is. It is. It's definitely Sunday.
*  The question is, if there is no game seven next, then I think it goes.
*  Yeah, I think it would be Tuesday in Boston because there was a scenario
*  where Boston, if Minnesota lost
*  and then the Knicks won, they would have had to go to Boston
*  because they need a Sunday game, but now they have the Sunday game.
*  So got you. There you go.
*  But I think that's a really hard turnaround for a team
*  that's playing basically six guys.
*  You're right. The go.
*  PM on Sunday would be would be rough.
*  So I wonder if that incentivizes them to try and take them out even more.
*  I mean, like you said, Tibbs doesn't really like do
*  we're going to do this at half speed, you know.
*  How long did you guys stare at the photo of young Tibbs with hair?
*  I'm still staring at it. Seven minutes.
*  I also was trying to figure out whether he got arrested in season three
*  of Miami Vice.
*  I thought I thought he looked like he was.
*  I don't know how many movies he looked like he was in, but it was at least 25.
*  And they were almost like you can tell me he's a talented Mr.
*  Ripley, like, yeah, I don't know.
*  He's Freddie's friend and talented Mr. Ripley in the record store.
*  There was a million.
*  He drove Glenn Fry to a gas station.
*  It could be a new rewatchable category was Tom
*  Tibbado in this movie, so that's good. Yeah.
*  Well, Ludo had a Miami Vice week last week.
*  I might have watched a couple of episodes.
*  The other thing every week is Miami Vice week.
*  Philip Baker Hall was in a Miami Vice CR.
*  Yeah. You know that?
*  Yes. I've watched the video of all the guys.
*  So I was all excited because I just thought Pluto had handed over a channel to Miami Vice.
*  But then it got replaced this week by the six million dollar man,
*  which was my first favorite show when I was a kid and is a very, very old show.
*  So I don't know what happened to my advice.
*  You do know in the streaming era, every day can be Miami Vice day.
*  I get that, Rob, but it's more fun if you just turn it on and it's playing already.
*  That's what you don't understand.
*  Kids don't understand the joy of not understanding.
*  Also, Phil then gets to watch 17 Ozempic ads on Pluto. Yeah.
*  Rob, I think we're going to announce right here that
*  you're going to be involved with our recaps of Clipped
*  on the FX channel. Yeah.
*  Six episodes, they've mailed out some screeners.
*  Are we excited for that show or not?
*  Excited is a word. I'm I'm intrigued.
*  You're off the show. You know what?
*  I don't like I didn't like the light in your eyes.
*  No, I'm excited to cover it. That's for damn sure.
*  Will it be a train wreck?
*  Who's to say?
*  Yeah, I'm very anxious to see how they got fish on board with this thing.
*  I can't wait to see what the, you know, faux JJ Reddick's jump shot
*  looks like in real time.
*  Lots of critiquing of the onscreen basketball to come. I can't wait.
*  See, are you excited?
*  Yeah, absolutely. For Clipped, for sure.
*  Are you excited for faux JJ Reddick to coach the Lakers?
*  I would actually that would be amazing if faux JJ Reddick was the coach.
*  Just an actor playing JJ Reddick.
*  Yeah. Is the JJ Reddick thing ridiculous to you guys or does it make sense?
*  I it whether it makes sense or not does seem kind of inevitable now at this point.
*  It's great. It's going to be great for content.
*  I'm rooting for it.
*  I just see a bunch of podcasters being hired for head coaching jobs.
*  And I'm. Yeah. Why?
*  Rob's getting ready.
*  You know, put my number out there.
*  Let's see. I wonder.
*  I want to know how hard it Mike Onori's job is.
*  Like you go up to Chris Finch, Chris Finch is like, yeah, but you're like, gotcha.
*  And then you get to go out and just be like, hey, he said that to come over here.
*  It seems a little reductive, but we found this out with the Luke Walton here.
*  He went like 24 and 0 to start the year.
*  Remember, Steve Card, the back surgery.
*  And it led to him being hired as a Laker coach for some crazy number.
*  He got the king's job.
*  And now he's like, you know, the assistant number three in the Cavs,
*  basically based on this 24 game sample size on the Warriors,
*  when it was one of the best teams of the decade.
*  So I don't know.
*  Yeah, I will.
*  I will say this. Mike Onori is kind of the CR of the NBA coaching world,
*  like immaculate vibes from Mike Onori.
*  He seems cool. Great.
*  Great hang. Very beloved coach.
*  I could I think he'd bring it a little more to the table on vibes alone.
*  All right. We're wrapping up the YouTube live show.
*  Thank you to Rob Mahoney.
*  Thank you to see our Chris Ryan.
*  It was good to see you guys and and stay tuned for the rest of the podcast,
