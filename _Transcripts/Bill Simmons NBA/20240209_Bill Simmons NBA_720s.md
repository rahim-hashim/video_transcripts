# The Lakers Really Did Nothing | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [February 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew)
*  Lakers did nothing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=0.0s)]
*  Chris Mannix tweeted, um, they were buffed all efforts to pry loose Austin Reeves. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=1.76s)]
*  And D'Angelo Russell's recent revival had that reconsidering the value gained by [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=8.16s)]
*  packaging Russell in a 29 number one. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  I totally agree with that by the way. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  Um, so they do nothing. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=16.88s)]
*  And I actually think that's the right move. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=20.16s)]
*  I'll be interested to see what LeBron thinks about it, but I actually, you know, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=23.28s)]
*  they made the Western finals last year. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=27.04s)]
*  They've had some injuries to at least some of their role players, but the way Davis has [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=29.28s)]
*  played this year, I don't think you need to go nuts and, you know, do some hail Mary trade. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  But on the other hand, Davis has been so good, you know, maybe bet on some of the guys you drafted [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  and you got in free agency, Gabe Benson will come back. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=44.8s)]
*  I'm not against it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=49.84s)]
*  Um, definitely I like them not doing anything because I don't think anything was presented [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=52.24s)]
*  where you go, wait a minute, why would you turn that down? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=56.96s)]
*  I think it was about flipping Austin Reeves for say, Levine of Levine were healthy, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=58.88s)]
*  but I think that's a LeBron motivated thing. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=64.08s)]
*  I think I'm wanting to jaunt a Murray would have been a LeBron motivated thing. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=66.48s)]
*  Even though I think Murray is better and you know, Murray's owed a lot of money, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=70.8s)]
*  but it's not like a gross contract, especially with the new landscape of the cap continuing to go up. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  So do you like what you've seen from Murray this season? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=78.56s)]
*  No, I like them. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=82.64s)]
*  I, I know he's not perfect. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=83.52000000000001s)]
*  You know, I can understand the warts, but it's not an ideal situation [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=85.2s)]
*  because Trey's so talented. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=88.56s)]
*  He's going to have a ton of possessions. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=89.84s)]
*  You could just see like I finally dawn on me, like as much as they've tried to stagger those [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=91.2s)]
*  two of the minutes and stuff, and it feels like they're playing more together now this year, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=95.04s)]
*  especially like in the fourth quarter, they just don't really play with each other. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=98.88s)]
*  It feels like, Hey, if it's a JaJante possession, then Trey's kind of over here. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=103.36s)]
*  And then when it's a little like the Mitchell Garland thing that we had issues with, I'm with [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  you. I agree. They don't mesh very well. It is what it is. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  So the market for Murray, I don't know if it was the money. I don't know if it's what people's [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=116.32s)]
*  seen in Atlanta, but it, it felt like it wasn't really that competitive and clearly Atlanta, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=120.8s)]
*  not moving him tells you, Hey, we just come back this summer. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  And that circles it back around to the Lakers here is that it didn't really make a ton of sense [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=128.88s)]
*  until they figure out what kind of draft capital they have, which is when New Orleans has to make [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=133.12s)]
*  a decision on whether they want the 24 or the 25 pick. And once that decision is made, then the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=137.12s)]
*  Lakers have more assets to then kind of look at it this summer, even though it's not on LeBron's [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=141.52s)]
*  timeline. You know, LeBron's got the juice when he's 25 and he's 30, when he's 35, and you're [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  freaked out as a front office and ownership as a guy who's 39 next year with the player option [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=151.84s)]
*  where he'll turn 40. I don't know that you're as beholden to go, well, we've got to do whatever [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=156.32000000000002s)]
*  this guy wants, which in this case, I think moving another pick in 29, moving a cheap player who's [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=162.32000000000002s)]
*  their third best player in the Reaves, despite what Russell's done this last month, plus, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=168.64s)]
*  I think it's the right move to stand path unless there was an option that you or I don't know about, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=173.04s)]
*  which is totally reasonable that there could have been something else. But clearly they didn't want [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=177.67999999999998s)]
*  to do anything until they figure out because they're going to have more picks come this June [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  to go, wait a minute. What do we do? Like we might have that other piece that we've been looking for [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=186.64s)]
*  here this summer. Somebody demands, they demand to come here. And then the other team would be like, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=192.64s)]
*  okay, well now you have access to more picks as opposed to the 129 that they have now. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=197.28s)]
*  I'd love to know from the Lakers side how fed up they were with LeBron. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=202.0s)]
*  And we'll never know because they're really good about not leaking stuff out. It's basically [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=206.64s)]
*  he had about some point gun. That's it. But I don't understand his week bill. I just don't [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=210.24s)]
*  understand it. You know, I said something about on Sunday's pod. I talked a lot about it on [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=215.68s)]
*  Tuesday. You know, they've done so much for the dude over the last six years and they've traded [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=221.68s)]
*  so much stuff away. They've traded so many players, acquired so many players back and forth. And [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=226.4s)]
*  you know, he's not the same guy anymore. He's 39 years old and I don't think he's one of the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=232.0s)]
*  eight to 10 best guys in the league. I don't think he can do it regularly like he used to. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  And, you know, unfortunately, I think this is what happens when players get, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=241.68s)]
*  that when the greatest players get older in the NBA, this is usually when they start getting [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=245.52s)]
*  grumpy. It even happened to Bert. Like go read Jack McCallum's book, Unfinished Business. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  It's about Bert's second to last year with Boston. He was super grumpy in his third to last year, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=255.68s)]
*  second to last year and was battling people and was mad all the time. And it's really tough for [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=260.88s)]
*  these guys when they go from, I used to be able to dominate and I was the best player in the league [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=266.24s)]
*  and I walked on the moon basically as a basketball player and now I'm getting older and it's not [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=270.72s)]
*  coming as easily. And maybe the, maybe when I snap my fingers, they're not getting me whatever I want. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=276.0s)]
*  And it does feel like there's some of that. Like for, if I'm the Lakers, the best thing he did for, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=281.92s)]
*  for us was, I'm saying us, like I'm with the Lakers, but Davis resigned and Davis has been [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  awesome this year. They got Reeves to get in on a pretty cheap contract, right? And they still have [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=294.0s)]
*  some flexibility. They have some picks down the road. And if Lebron doesn't want to stay, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=299.2s)]
*  I'm not going nuts if I'm the Lakers. I'm like, you know what? We're okay. We still have Davis. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=303.92s)]
*  He's one of the best 12 players in the league and we have some pieces. We're still in a big city [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=308.08s)]
*  and we'll be fine. What do you think? As far as his decision on the player option, I mean, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=312.88s)]
*  it's a massive, massive number. I don't know if he would just decide, you know what, I'm going to [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=319.03999999999996s)]
*  go chase it somewhere else for like a completely reduced salary for, for one year and an option [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=322.24s)]
*  or two years. A lot of teams have cap space though. I mean, yeah. Where's it? Is it the right teams? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=326.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Right. So when you go through the teams that have the cap space, Philadelphia is the only one [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  that you would say, you know, and more even said it recently in an interview. He's like, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=336.64s)]
*  there's not going to be any teams that are as good as, as, as we are this summer with their projected [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=339.44s)]
*  50 plus million in cap space, depending on where the cap lands at like 141, 142 million. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=344.4s)]
*  But I just didn't really like, well, Lebron is very simple and we're all this way. You, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=349.68s)]
*  you do what you can get away with. And for his entire career, he has delivered on that promise [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  of when you have me, you are in contention. Okay. Probably better than any basketball player since [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=360.47999999999996s)]
*  George. Yeah. No, that's a very short list of guys. It's like, as soon as I'm on your team, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=365.68s)]
*  you have a chance. And he's extended that window beyond anything was even imaginable. So anytime [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=369.92s)]
*  I'm critical of him, I almost feel guilty because I feel like it has to be talked about like in two [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=375.04s)]
*  lanes. One is what he is doing at his age and that it's just, it's so absurd. There's nothing even [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=378.88s)]
*  left to say because you can't believe it. But as far as who is as a player now and what his demands [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=385.76s)]
*  are and how it was always met in the past, because you were always on this Lebron clock of [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=391.52s)]
*  him having all this power and these shorter deals that he used to do before he got to Los Angeles, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=395.84s)]
*  where you're constantly worried about, is he happy? And he wants you to move every single pick [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=400.08s)]
*  for him. And for that season, even if he's probably like a long-term bad partner, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=404.56s)]
*  because he's not worried about any of that other stuff, he's completely about him and his own [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=408.79999999999995s)]
*  quest, which is fine. He was that kind of player, but as 39 years old heading into 40, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=412.88s)]
*  and it's like, okay, what kind of player are we likely going to have? And by the way, normally [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=418.47999999999996s)]
*  he misses like 20 plus games and he's not missing any time this year. So that's another part of [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=422.71999999999997s)]
*  this. Like when you look at the Lakers, you go, wait, Lebron's putting up these numbers and he [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=427.2s)]
*  hasn't missed any time. AD's played all season. He's been great. D'Angelo Russell's hitting every [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=430.96s)]
*  single shot now. Ree's after the slump, wasn't very good, but like what's wrong with him? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=434.96s)]
*  I felt like, you know, the Nick's towel thing was stupid. The tweet, he can't help himself. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=440.55999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Right. And he had a quote where it was like, hey, do you think after they'd beaten [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=447.59999999999997s)]
*  Charlotte, I think somebody asked him like, does this prove, you know, with this little uptick [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=453.84s)]
*  lately, like this team has a chance, I'm paraphrasing, right? Has a chance. Does this [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=457.28s)]
*  win streak kind of prove that thing? You know, classic like end of game question. And Lebron was [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=461.52s)]
*  like, basically, hey, this is who we have. So whatever. And instead you think somebody would go, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=466.96s)]
*  who's a little more polished would just go. A lot of the guys from last year that made a run that [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=473.91999999999996s)]
*  nobody thought we could make are all here. We know what it takes. Just let us get in because of what [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=479.03999999999996s)]
*  we did last year. Right. We won the end season tournament. We have a good team. Right. Western [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=483.67999999999995s)]
*  conference finals. And instead of doing that, which most every guy would do, who's been around [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=488.55999999999995s)]
*  long enough, he basically was like, eh, you know, we're not that good. So unless these guys do [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=493.91999999999996s)]
*  something. And I thought if I were a teammate and you start yelling that your son is good enough to [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=499.52s)]
*  start for the team right now, I'd be like, are you serious, dude? Are you serious? And I know he's [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=504.71999999999997s)]
*  hyping up his son, which is cool. And it's a proud dad. So like a part of it, but if I'm another [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=512.0799999999999s)]
*  player. So, you know, to my original point, when he's 25, 30, 35, you're freaked out this whole week. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=517.84s)]
*  It's 2014 LeBron. It's different. But right now you're kind of like, Hey, I know you wanted to do [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=525.36s)]
*  something, but what was on the table didn't make a lot of sense for us. And now we have more options [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=531.8399999999999s)]
*  this summer. The thing that really kills them is the Westbrook trade. Yeah. That was kind of his [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=536.4s)]
*  get out of jail free card with them with we got to do this. And it worked out so badly. I don't know [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=544.0799999999999s)]
*  if they have to listen the same way. I'm not even sure. I know they got to the Western finals last [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=549.1999999999999s)]
*  year, but in retrospect, do you think a Western final sweep was worth giving up the 27 first and [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=553.76s)]
*  just getting Vanderbilt and D-Low basically? No. Yeah. It's tough in retrospect. Now when they were [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=560.4s)]
*  making a run last year, it seemed better, but then you go back, you look at that run, they're [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=567.2s)]
*  playing Memphis. They catch Memphis banged up at the perfect time. And then they get Golden State. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=570.4s)]
*  I did. After that series for a team that got swept too. And it was, I liked them. I felt like they were close. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=575.92s)]
*  You said you thought they were the third best team in the NBA. Yeah. So was that worth the 27 pick [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=581.52s)]
*  that they could finish last season as the third best team in the NBA basically? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=587.36s)]
*  Well, it's an unfair answer. I think you could argue yes. Well, I don't know. If you say, hey, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=593.68s)]
*  if you make this move, you get Westbrook out of here because it became untenable both ways. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=598.72s)]
*  Because it is weird reading some of this Westbrook stuff where he's happy with the Clippers and [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=602.72s)]
*  everything. And you're like, oh, he's embraced it. And there's a lot of anti-Laker stuff [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=606.4s)]
*  that'll happen with the coverage of that. It's like, you know what? Westbrook at that point [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=611.36s)]
*  needed to probably go through that to then understand. Right. He needed a nut kick. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=615.04s)]
*  Right. It was too early for him to, it may not even be a Clippers-Lakers thing. Maybe it's Lebron. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=619.28s)]
*  Who knows? But that first wake up call usually isn't smooth for anybody. And he may have needed [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=625.36s)]
*  to actually go through that to be happy and understand everything he needs here. But if [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=632.24s)]
*  you had said, hey, if you move this 27 first round pick and you're going to have a chance [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=636.4s)]
*  in the Western Conference finals, you go, okay, wait, like, what's the point? Let's do it. But [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=640.32s)]
*  then looking back and saying, and phrasing it as, oh, they got swept and they had no chance against [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=645.2s)]
*  Denver. And now that pick is still due. I think you can make an argument actually for an answer [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=648.8000000000001s)]
*  on both of them. But to me, it doesn't feel worth it because you're just moving off of somebody. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=654.32s)]
*  And you're bringing in a role guy in Vando, who I do like, and D'Angelo where- [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=658.32s)]
*  And I know what the numbers- Can't really- [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=662.32s)]
*  I know what- Yeah, but I know what the numbers are for Russell. But [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=663.7600000000001s)]
*  you also know that that other stretch is coming. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=667.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's true. He's a craps table. It's like the craps table is hot. I'm going to keep winning all [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=670.0799999999999s)]
*  day. I think the Westbrook thing is hilarious that he's actually become one of my favorite bench guys. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=675.04s)]
*  I- Yeah, you were mad at me the other day for not including him in my Clippers breakdown. You love [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=682.64s)]
*  Westbrook now. Yeah, I know. Well, no, I like him. I think it's nice to have a guy on your team [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=686.64s)]
*  that can change the energy of a game, which he can do. He can come in. If the team's kind of dead, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=692.0s)]
*  they're down 12, he comes in, he's flying around, he's getting rebounds, and he can shift the energy, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=697.6s)]
*  which I think is a skill that I don't- he was not able to do on the Lakers for whatever reason. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPNYuuRqew&t=702.96s)]
