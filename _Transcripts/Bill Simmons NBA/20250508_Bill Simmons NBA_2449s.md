# The Celtics Are Falling Apart … Why? With Bill’s Dad | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw)
*  All right, taping this part of the podcast, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=0.0s)]
*  it is four o'clock East Coast time, my dad is here. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1.96s)]
*  We did not talk after yesterday's game. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=5.98s)]
*  It's very rare when we don't even talk or text after a game. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=8.22s)]
*  And I finally texted you about a 90 minutes after [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=13.6s)]
*  and we just swore at each other a couple times [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=16.2s)]
*  about how bad the Celtics were. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=18.3s)]
*  You went to both games. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=19.88s)]
*  You were there, you were in your seat, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=21.86s)]
*  you'd been going for 52 years. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=23.64s)]
*  We were, I think, minus eight or 900 favorites [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=26.16s)]
*  to win the series. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=28.96s)]
*  And they took huge leads in both games and blew the games. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  And yet game two felt way worse than game one. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=34.36s)]
*  What was it like sitting there [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  and watching the season unravel? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  I agree, game two was much worse than game one. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=43.44s)]
*  I might agree though, like you said, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=48.96s)]
*  we had 20 point leads in the third quarter of both games. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=50.6s)]
*  And in game one, I think the crowd was so confident. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=54.1s)]
*  You just could feel the confidence in the crowd. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=58.44s)]
*  We're not gonna lose the 20 point lead. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  And of course we lost that lead. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=63.4s)]
*  Game two, it was a very nervous crowd. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=65.44s)]
*  And you've been at games like that [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=68.86s)]
*  where you walk in the garden, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=71.86s)]
*  people are late getting to their seats, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  nobody's talking very much. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=76.16s)]
*  You're looking up to see if Cozingis is playing, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=78.56s)]
*  he's not in the starting lineup. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=80.72s)]
*  Somebody says, no, he's not playing, da da da. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=82.44s)]
*  He finally comes out. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  He looks like he's dead, run over. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=87.32s)]
*  He just looked terrible. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=90.11999999999999s)]
*  He had no color in his skin. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  Super skinny. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=93.96s)]
*  Well, he's always skinny, but his coloring was off. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=96.0s)]
*  And he just looked like he's dealing with an illness [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=99.16s)]
*  and he had no strength. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=103.36s)]
*  He just had no strength. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  Okay, putting that aside, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=106.44s)]
*  somehow we're up by 20 in the third quarter, right? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=108.52s)]
*  Now the Knicks, I thought played a terrible first half [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  or they had really bad luck. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=115.84s)]
*  They had a lot of shots that rimmed out in and out. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=118.16s)]
*  And meanwhile, halftime comes, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=121.28s)]
*  I look up at the scoreboard, Jason Tatum, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  first team all NBA has two points. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=128.32s)]
*  What the hell? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=131.74s)]
*  He has two points. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=132.72s)]
*  I didn't even notice him in the game. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=134.36s)]
*  It's like he was the one who was out, not Cozingis. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=136.56s)]
*  All right, we come back, we get the big lead. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=140.16s)]
*  I think it was third quarter, we made a run. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  Knicks is still not shooting well. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=146.6s)]
*  I think the coach took Brunson out [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=148.88s)]
*  because he didn't have it for a while. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  But go to the fourth quarter, suddenly we're up by 16. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=153.95999999999998s)]
*  I look up at the clock, there's eight minutes to go. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=159.04s)]
*  And I remember this vividly, Tatum steals the ball. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=162.44s)]
*  He comes running down the court with Brown, two on one. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=165.92s)]
*  We're gonna go up by 18, right? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=169.7s)]
*  Throws it to Brown. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=172.4s)]
*  Brown, of course, fumbles the ball [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=174.04s)]
*  and it goes out of bounds. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=175.96s)]
*  And that was the game to me. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=177.72s)]
*  I'm watching Jason Tatum with two points to the halftime, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=180.04000000000002s)]
*  shooting three after three, once again in the fourth quarter. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=184.32s)]
*  And I'm watching Jaylen Brown turnover after turnover. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=188.08s)]
*  We've missed 13 straight shots in that fourth quarter. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=193.16s)]
*  And our defense sunk. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=197.28s)]
*  It's like the air went out of the balloon. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=200.68s)]
*  We kept missing shots. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=203.28s)]
*  The Knicks would come down and they took very good shots. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=205.2s)]
*  We were taking terrible shots. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=209.04s)]
*  And you've been to this kind of game [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=211.76s)]
*  where Brown and Tatum, eight minutes to go, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=213.7s)]
*  they start dribbling the ball at the perimeter. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=218.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's the plan with your food offense. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=221.24s)]
*  Yes, it's the isolation. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=223.36s)]
*  Yes, you look up at the clock, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=224.96s)]
*  because I kept looking up at the clock, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=226.72s)]
*  five or six seconds left. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=228.76s)]
*  One of them makes a move too late. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=230.44s)]
*  Another missed shot, 13 straight missed shots. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=233.32s)]
*  The Knicks come down, they're moving the ball really fast. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=235.9s)]
*  Their pace was excellent. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=238.96s)]
*  The ball's going around, they get the open guy. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=240.96s)]
*  They make not a three, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=244.04s)]
*  because their three point shooting was iffy, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=245.44s)]
*  but they get good shots near the rim. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=248.14s)]
*  The second game was much more frustrating [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=255.36s)]
*  than the first game, because it was such a must need game. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=257.98s)]
*  We couldn't afford to lose last night. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=261.94s)]
*  I think the craziest part of it is the Knicks had, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=265.54s)]
*  I think their worst offensive game, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=268.62s)]
*  just by offensive rating of the entire season. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=270.28000000000003s)]
*  They played pretty well, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=273.1s)]
*  especially Brunson was really good [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=274.62s)]
*  down the stretch of game one, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=276.18s)]
*  and I thought they really took the game. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=277.66s)]
*  The one last night was just all self-inflicted wounds, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=279.94s)]
*  some very strange coaching, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=283.3s)]
*  which I'm excited to talk about. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=284.70000000000005s)]
*  Well, I want to talk about the coaching. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=286.22s)]
*  Did you demote Joe, second row Joe again? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=290.22s)]
*  You know, I don't get it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=293.82000000000005s)]
*  He got greatly out coached, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=295.34000000000003s)]
*  and I'm not a Tibbs fan either. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=298.38000000000005s)]
*  I think he runs his, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=300.74s)]
*  although he used his bench pretty well in games one and two. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=303.82000000000005s)]
*  But I don't know, are we going to coaching? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=306.78000000000003s)]
*  No, let's go backwards. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=311.02000000000004s)]
*  Because I mean, there's a couple of things, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=313.1s)]
*  a couple of big pictures thing here. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=317.26000000000005s)]
*  First of all, I can't remember [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=318.86s)]
*  a Celtics playoff thing like this. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=320.34000000000003s)]
*  I was trying to think of a series [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=322.8s)]
*  where I just think they have clearly a better team [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=324.90000000000003s)]
*  and history would show [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=328.34000000000003s)]
*  because no team has ever blown 20 point leads. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=330.22s)]
*  I don't think in the same playoffs, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=332.70000000000005s)]
*  much less back to back in the same playoff games. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=334.14000000000004s)]
*  It felt like they were getting all the shots they wanted, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=337.54s)]
*  and they just missed open shots. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=339.58000000000004s)]
*  There was that screenshot somebody had [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=341.5s)]
*  that was going around social media [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=343.85999999999996s)]
*  of Tatum in the corner with like 340 left. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=345.02s)]
*  Brown's under the basket, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=347.73999999999995s)]
*  and Brunson's fell down, he's on the ground. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=349.14s)]
*  And Tatum just has a wide open 25 footer. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=351.94s)]
*  He could also just pass it to Brown, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=354.7s)]
*  and it was a brick, but it was turning in. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=357.21999999999997s)]
*  I don't know what it felt like being in the building. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=358.9s)]
*  It felt like every time we took a three, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=361.94s)]
*  I didn't think it was going in. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=363.41999999999996s)]
*  I did not think it was going in, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=365.34s)]
*  but also you gave a great example [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=366.7s)]
*  of that total fourth quarter. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=370.66s)]
*  We never made the extra pass. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=372.90000000000003s)]
*  Which is when this team gets into trouble. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=375.70000000000005s)]
*  Each guy wanted to make the hero shot [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=377.34000000000003s)]
*  and make the lead larger. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=379.98s)]
*  Cause I think we had 12 point leads starting on that. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=382.58000000000004s)]
*  It was 73-53 at one point, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=385.66s)]
*  then it was 16 points in the fourth quarter, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=388.06s)]
*  and the Knicks weren't playing well. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=390.46000000000004s)]
*  And just there's some strategy stuff [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=392.86s)]
*  I want to talk about later, but fundamentally, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=394.94000000000005s)]
*  these two Tatum games were just atrocious. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=398.22s)]
*  And it's weird because then all this stuff [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=401.62s)]
*  starts up again today about he's not actually a superstar [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=403.7s)]
*  and the national media can come in [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=406.38s)]
*  that isn't watching the whole season. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=407.74s)]
*  They're not there week after week watching what we saw. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=410.86s)]
*  I really bought in. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=413.7s)]
*  I thought he went up a level. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=414.62s)]
*  We talked about it a bunch. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=415.86s)]
*  There was a level of dissection [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=418.14s)]
*  and kind of artistry to what he was doing [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=420.86s)]
*  the last four months of the season in the Orlando game, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=424.3s)]
*  where I really felt like he was solving equations [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=426.94s)]
*  on the fly. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=429.18s)]
*  He was making the right plays. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=430.02s)]
*  He could be point forward. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=431.62s)]
*  He could score. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=432.78s)]
*  He had just figured out the balance. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=434.06s)]
*  I really believed he had figured it out. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=435.54s)]
*  And then the guy that we watched, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=438.06s)]
*  especially in game two, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=439.62s)]
*  was the guy from the 2020 playoffs [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=441.46s)]
*  and the 2022 later in the playoffs. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=443.78s)]
*  It was like he reverted. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=445.98s)]
*  And you said you thought it was the worst game [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=447.74s)]
*  you'd seen him play in person in a couple of years, right? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=449.38s)]
*  Yeah, a little bit worse probably than game one. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=453.97999999999996s)]
*  Both games were horrendous, Tatum games. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=457.58s)]
*  You remember it was the last basket we made. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=462.41999999999996s)]
*  We went up by one point and Tatum went straight down [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=466.5s)]
*  the middle, went to the back. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=469.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=470.94s)]
*  That middle was open all game long. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=471.78s)]
*  Ending game one. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=474.78s)]
*  He just wouldn't do it. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=475.85999999999996s)]
*  He's stubborn. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=479.18s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=480.21999999999997s)]
*  The coach is more stubborn, which is a real problem. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=482.18s)]
*  But even that three point shot, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=485.14s)]
*  which he was wide open in the corner, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=488.97999999999996s)]
*  I saw Brown underneath, wide open. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=491.3s)]
*  Take the two. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=494.02s)]
*  We needed points. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=495.18s)]
*  We didn't need a three. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=496.7s)]
*  We needed points. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=498.02s)]
*  But what's been weird about it is the whole year, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=499.94s)]
*  he was getting so good. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=502.62s)]
*  And I felt like it was getting better in real time [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=503.97999999999996s)]
*  over the course of the season of him being like, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=506.06s)]
*  oh, if I can switch and get this guy on me, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=508.7s)]
*  I'm gonna go right by him and get to the basket. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=512.9799999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna get to the paint. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=514.8199999999999s)]
*  Or I'm gonna find, he started to develop that little shot [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=515.66s)]
*  around the foul line, that little 14 footer. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=517.6999999999999s)]
*  And he was just really putting it together. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=520.6999999999999s)]
*  And then this turned into the old, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=523.3399999999999s)]
*  all the old Tatum habits came back. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=525.5799999999999s)]
*  And I don't know what you think it was pressure. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=527.7399999999999s)]
*  Like what was going on? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=529.3399999999999s)]
*  Did the guys look nervous? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=530.18s)]
*  What was happening? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=531.38s)]
*  I wish I knew the answer. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=533.2199999999999s)]
*  That first half, again, I never noticed Tatum. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=535.66s)]
*  He was getting rebounds at least. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=540.66s)]
*  He was playing defensive rebounds. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=541.86s)]
*  Oh no, he was getting rebounds. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=543.6999999999999s)]
*  I should give him that credit. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=544.6999999999999s)]
*  You're talking about offensively. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=546.78s)]
*  You never noticed him in ball. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=547.98s)]
*  I mean, he was getting defensive rebounds. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=549.8199999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=551.6999999999999s)]
*  Offensively, he wasn't in the picture. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=553.1s)]
*  And they go to this stretch in the second quarter, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=556.3s)]
*  which blows my mind. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=558.4599999999999s)]
*  They take Tatum out and they put Jalen Brown in charge. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=560.02s)]
*  Yeah, you call it the Jalen Brown in charge minutes. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=563.9399999999999s)]
*  Every dribbling out at the three point line, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=567.5400000000001s)]
*  five seconds left, he makes his move. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=571.22s)]
*  Yeah, in the shot clock. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=574.34s)]
*  More often than not, it dribbles off his knee [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=576.0600000000001s)]
*  and goes out of bounds, but he had a terrible game. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=578.7800000000001s)]
*  I don't know how many turnovers he had. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=583.0200000000001s)]
*  It was weird. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=585.34s)]
*  It started to seem like he was gonna have a good game [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=586.1800000000001s)]
*  because he was kind of punishing. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=588.4200000000001s)]
*  He was trying to take Hart down low early. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=589.98s)]
*  Yeah, he was. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=592.0200000000001s)]
*  And then by the end of the game, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=592.86s)]
*  I think his stats ended up being awful. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=594.1800000000001s)]
*  They were... [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=597.02s)]
*  But you know, that's one of my main complaints. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=597.86s)]
*  Five, yeah, eight for 23. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=600.94s)]
*  They play a completely different game [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=602.86s)]
*  in the first three quarters than in the fourth quarter. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=604.9s)]
*  And this is very consistent. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=609.0600000000001s)]
*  First three quarters, the ball is moving somewhat. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=611.22s)]
*  Brown is going into the, at least trying to go to the hoop. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=614.94s)]
*  They're passing the ball a little bit. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=619.86s)]
*  We had more assists than the Knicks [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=621.74s)]
*  in the first three quarters. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=623.98s)]
*  The fourth quarter, it's isolation. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=625.7s)]
*  It's just like what we saw two years ago against Miami [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=627.86s)]
*  or three years ago against Golden State. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=632.5s)]
*  It's like they forget. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=634.7800000000001s)]
*  And I keep coming back to the coach. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=636.62s)]
*  You know, you have a coach. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=639.38s)]
*  The coach... [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=641.0200000000001s)]
*  Oh wait, hold off on the coach. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=641.86s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=643.0200000000001s)]
*  It's hard to hold off. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=644.1s)]
*  Because this was last year when the opponents [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=645.1800000000001s)]
*  were a little easier based on injury, luck, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=648.34s)]
*  and where the league was. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=651.2199999999999s)]
*  There were still some nut crunch games [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=652.54s)]
*  when you never felt totally comfortable offensively. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=654.6999999999999s)]
*  And it was still a lot of this, your turn, my turn. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=657.62s)]
*  Things would get a little stagnant. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=661.06s)]
*  The difference was Jaylen, I thought, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=662.9799999999999s)]
*  there were a couple games when he just athletically [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=665.4599999999999s)]
*  really seemed like he could get to the spots he wanted. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=668.54s)]
*  He was really in complete command. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=671.26s)]
*  And they had the Porzingis piece too, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=673.7399999999999s)]
*  where they're, you know, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=675.26s)]
*  they didn't have them in the entire Dallas series, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=676.66s)]
*  but you was this extra 18 to 20 bonus points [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=678.26s)]
*  you were getting. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=682.18s)]
*  But when I think back to last year, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=683.14s)]
*  there was that Indiana game that you went to [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=684.86s)]
*  that Brown hit the three in the corner to send it to OT. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=687.26s)]
*  That felt a little like these Knicks games, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=690.34s)]
*  where it was like, ah, we're getting stagnant again. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=692.14s)]
*  And then we lucked out, got in overtime. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=694.5s)]
*  And then the other one was the one I went to in Dallas, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=696.5s)]
*  game three, when Luca fouled out with five minutes left. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=698.86s)]
*  And all of a sudden it was sitting there for, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=702.3s)]
*  ah, Kyrie's gonna really kill us [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=705.26s)]
*  and bring this series back. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=707.22s)]
*  This is like, this is where the last seven years [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=708.58s)]
*  have been leading to Kyrie bringing Dallas back and 2-1, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=710.58s)]
*  and we're gonna fall into all the bad habits. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=714.34s)]
*  But then they actually held this Dallas off [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=716.26s)]
*  and won that game. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=718.3000000000001s)]
*  And Brown had a couple of big plays and it was like, ah, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=719.5s)]
*  finally got over the hump. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=722.34s)]
*  And now it feels like we're back in the other side [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=724.02s)]
*  of the hump again with this team. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=725.78s)]
*  And that's the part I don't understand. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=727.5s)]
*  We should be getting better, not worse. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=729.02s)]
*  Walking out of the stadium last night [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=731.5400000000001s)]
*  was worse than Monday night, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=734.7s)]
*  because at least Monday night we knew we had a game [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=737.5400000000001s)]
*  Wednesday night and we could tie the series. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=740.0200000000001s)]
*  But there were so many people walking down the stairs, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=742.82s)]
*  well, two things. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=746.58s)]
*  So many people walking down the stairs saying, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=747.74s)]
*  Tatum didn't show up. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=750.1400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he got rebounds, but he never was in the offense. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=752.58s)]
*  He never took charge. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=756.46s)]
*  Or when he had the ball, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=758.1400000000001s)]
*  all he wanted to do was dribble on the perimeter. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=759.6600000000001s)]
*  Isolation, dribble on the perimeter. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=762.78s)]
*  Yeah, he had five assists, five field goals. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=766.26s)]
*  So he created 20 points. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=769.58s)]
*  And this is a guy who, when he's really humming, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=772.14s)]
*  he's at like 28 points, eight assists, 14 rebounds, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=775.54s)]
*  and he's just kind of involved all over the game. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=780.0600000000001s)]
*  And he wasn't. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=782.74s)]
*  When you were watching the game on TV, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=783.58s)]
*  was it obvious to you that he only had, not the number, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=784.86s)]
*  but that it's possibly only had two points at halftime? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=787.74s)]
*  I actually liked how he was rebounding and kind of fighting. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=791.54s)]
*  And it felt like they were trying to establish Jalen. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=794.8199999999999s)]
*  Then poor Zingus came in. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=797.2199999999999s)]
*  It's like, we gotta try to get him going a little bit. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=798.5s)]
*  Prichard took a bunch of shots. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=800.66s)]
*  And I thought maybe he was biding his time. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=802.66s)]
*  And that was the wrong instinct. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=805.4599999999999s)]
*  Does first team all NBA guy bide his time [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=807.9399999999999s)]
*  in a must-win game? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=811.9399999999999s)]
*  It's a tough one for, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=814.5799999999999s)]
*  I think a lot of the Celtic fans [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=816.26s)]
*  were really defensive about him this year, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=817.66s)]
*  because we were watching game to game how good he was. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=819.46s)]
*  Yeah, he had a great season. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=821.94s)]
*  And then the casual fans come in, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=823.14s)]
*  or the people that aren't watching all the time, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=825.1s)]
*  and they see this version of it, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=826.7s)]
*  and they're like, that's why he got benched in the Olympics. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=827.94s)]
*  This is why he's not a superstar. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=831.1s)]
*  This is why he's not at the same level. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=833.02s)]
*  But then you watch like Yoke Edge in game one against OKC, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=834.34s)]
*  put up the 42, 22, and six. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=838.4200000000001s)]
*  You know, you watch Shay respond in a game two. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=841.4200000000001s)]
*  He's got 34 points and three quarters. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=843.7800000000001s)]
*  And it's like, that's the level, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=845.7800000000001s)]
*  that's the swimming pool you're supposed to be in, buddy. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=847.94s)]
*  It's a good point. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=850.0200000000001s)]
*  When I came home, I watched the first half of the OKC game, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=851.1s)]
*  because I couldn't go to sleep. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=854.86s)]
*  And I'm thinking, you know, Shay showed up [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=856.6600000000001s)]
*  because he knew this was a must game, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=861.0600000000001s)]
*  and he's an all NBA kind of guy. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=863.3000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=866.46s)]
*  Our guy didn't, at least offensively. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=867.3000000000001s)]
*  Well, it's tough for him when they keep showing the two, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=871.1800000000001s)]
*  you didn't see because you were at the game, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=873.34s)]
*  but there are two commercials [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=874.58s)]
*  that just keep showing a Tatum. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=876.3s)]
*  And then meanwhile, he's thinking in the game. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=878.5799999999999s)]
*  I mean, there's some other issues that Robinson, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=881.3399999999999s)]
*  the plus minus numbers with him have been really good [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=884.78s)]
*  when he's out there. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=887.2199999999999s)]
*  I still don't understand why Tatum's not just getting him [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=888.18s)]
*  in a switch and then torturing him every time. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=890.74s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=892.8599999999999s)]
*  He's been effective. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=894.02s)]
*  And then McBride has been, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=895.2199999999999s)]
*  I mean, he only had five points yesterday, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=897.3s)]
*  but at least when they know they can put him out there [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=898.6999999999999s)]
*  and he's not going to be bad. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=900.42s)]
*  So they have seven guys. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=901.3399999999999s)]
*  And as we know, you need seven guys in a playoff series [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=902.8199999999999s)]
*  to be able to win and they have seven at least. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=905.66s)]
*  Yeah, McBride had a good game one. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=907.18s)]
*  Yeah, he's okay. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=909.14s)]
*  He wasn't very noticeable last night. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=910.5s)]
*  But he's at least a body that they know they can throw out [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=913.3399999999999s)]
*  and they're playing all these other guys, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=915.8199999999999s)]
*  pretty big minutes. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=918.5s)]
*  And then Hart is the kind of guy [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=919.3399999999999s)]
*  that has always hurt the Celtics, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=920.54s)]
*  this version of the Celtics. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=921.98s)]
*  Hart really hurt us. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=922.98s)]
*  Hart consistently seemed to be on the weak side [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=924.78s)]
*  getting the rebound. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=928.14s)]
*  Yeah, he's around the ball. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=928.98s)]
*  This isn't, especially without poor Zingas, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=930.4599999999999s)]
*  it's kind of a group rebounding Celtics team [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=933.54s)]
*  and Tatum's the best rebounder on the team [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=935.86s)]
*  by far at this point. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=937.54s)]
*  But the poor Zingas thing's a huge piece [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=939.7s)]
*  because it has that staggered effect of, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=941.58s)]
*  it's not just bad that they're not getting the points [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=945.94s)]
*  and the extra minutes from him, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=948.26s)]
*  but then it's pushing more minutes on Horford, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=949.42s)]
*  who you tell me what he looked like in person. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=951.78s)]
*  It looked like he was luggage last night. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=954.42s)]
*  Yeah, he didn't have a very good game for sure. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=957.42s)]
*  You know, he had a good series against Orlando. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=959.58s)]
*  But games one and games, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=964.26s)]
*  game one and game two last night, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=966.1s)]
*  he looked tired and he looked his age. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=968.38s)]
*  Well, and they put all the big burden on him [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=972.1s)]
*  twice in three days. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=973.78s)]
*  They did, and you know, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=975.18s)]
*  I think guarding Townes, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=977.98s)]
*  he gives up so much height to Townes. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=981.18s)]
*  Townes really just shoots over him. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=983.98s)]
*  And I think it influences his offense. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=985.9s)]
*  The three point shot was off, obviously. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=988.38s)]
*  Over five. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=990.82s)]
*  I think all of them were wide open. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=992.14s)]
*  Tatum was one for five. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=993.9s)]
*  You know, I would have liked to have seen Pritchard more. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=995.42s)]
*  So that's the coaching stuff. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=998.9s)]
*  That was one of the things, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1001.22s)]
*  because I noticed this in game one. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1002.34s)]
*  You could talk me into the three guards [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1005.26s)]
*  with Tatum and Brown, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1006.9s)]
*  versus relying on Horford as much [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1008.62s)]
*  and making Tatum almost like the undersized center [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1010.38s)]
*  and trying to attack the Knicks that way, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1013.54s)]
*  because then it becomes, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1015.1s)]
*  when they're trying to get a switch on Brunson, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1016.86s)]
*  they're just trying to get Horford on Brunson every time. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1018.54s)]
*  You've Pritchard out there. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1021.06s)]
*  They're probably gonna settle on Pritchard guarding Brunson, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1021.9399999999999s)]
*  but I just like that matchup more. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1024.06s)]
*  And then he gives them spacing on the other side [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1025.94s)]
*  that's just better than Horford. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1028.1s)]
*  And I don't feel like they're losing, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1029.78s)]
*  how many rebounds did Horford have yesterday? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1031.34s)]
*  Four. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1033.06s)]
*  You're not like losing, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1033.9s)]
*  you're losing a little rim protection, that's it. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1035.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1037.62s)]
*  Well, you know, especially in the fourth quarter last night, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1038.46s)]
*  we missed 13 straight shots. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1041.7s)]
*  You know, some of them were Horford shots. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1044.18s)]
*  There was no Pritchard. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1046.7s)]
*  Now Pritchard had a couple of shots in the first half. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1047.98s)]
*  They rimmed out. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1051.94s)]
*  But I would have liked to have seen him in there. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1055.1s)]
*  You know, it's... [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1057.46s)]
*  And no Hauser either, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1058.5s)]
*  who sometimes will have the two threes [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1059.66s)]
*  in the second quarter that he's a little bit... [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1061.5s)]
*  Yeah, Hauser's injured, so we knew he wasn't gonna play. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1062.82s)]
*  But this fourth quarter, over and over, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1066.26s)]
*  when Tatum Brown have the psyche to take over [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1071.42s)]
*  and play hero basketball, they ignore it. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1076.42s)]
*  They ignore Pritchard. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1079.26s)]
*  I mean, Pritchard can be wide open, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1081.58s)]
*  and they're gonna do their own thing [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1083.34s)]
*  trying to get their shot off. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1085.46s)]
*  In the first half, they'll pass it around, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1088.7s)]
*  and Pritchard will get more wide open shots. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1091.78s)]
*  Before we blame Mazzulla, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1095.66s)]
*  do you take any blame for bringing your brother Don [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1098.1s)]
*  to this game? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1100.78s)]
*  Because I can't say he's great luck over the years. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1101.8999999999999s)]
*  I thought it was a bold move. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1104.62s)]
*  I don't know what the other choices were, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1106.7s)]
*  but Don gets super tense during these games. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1108.22s)]
*  And I can't even imagine what he was like yesterday [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1112.3400000000001s)]
*  during this. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1114.46s)]
*  At the eight minute mark, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1115.3s)]
*  or it was probably almost nine minutes, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1117.38s)]
*  I said to Don, Don, we're up 16. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1120.18s)]
*  It looks pretty good. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1122.42s)]
*  But this is around the point Monday night, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1123.7s)]
*  where, and he said, no, we're in good shape. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1126.7s)]
*  Oh, no, he's confident. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1129.8200000000002s)]
*  Well, I was watching with your favorite granddaughter, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1132.94s)]
*  and when we're up 73 to 53, and she's like, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1135.6200000000001s)]
*  well, they bounced back, and I'm like, just wait. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1139.14s)]
*  I don't trust anything that's happening right now. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1140.22s)]
*  It's just wait. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1142.42s)]
*  I don't feel good until, but. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1143.26s)]
*  Even the crowd didn't trust the lead, by the way. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1146.1000000000001s)]
*  We've been to so many games where, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1151.26s)]
*  in a game one, the crowd was so loud and confident. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1153.5s)]
*  Last night, we had the 20 point lead, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1157.7s)]
*  then it was a 16 point lead with almost nine minutes to go. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1160.1000000000001s)]
*  Nobody was confident. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1164.26s)]
*  Yeah, and they're acting like they're four. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1165.3000000000002s)]
*  I was trying to think before we talk about Missoula. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1168.38s)]
*  I can't remember another Celtics playoff team [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1172.74s)]
*  since you had the tickets, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1174.8200000000002s)]
*  that I felt like was clearly better [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1177.3400000000001s)]
*  than the team they're losing to. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1179.42s)]
*  And I don't mean that as sour grapes. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1181.66s)]
*  The Knicks, we've seen this. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1183.66s)]
*  This happens at football all the time. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1184.9s)]
*  Part of playing the games is this is why you play the games, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1186.8600000000001s)]
*  and somebody's gotta win, and you can overachieve, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1190.18s)]
*  or you can just band together. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1192.98s)]
*  And the Knicks made all the plays down the stretch, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1194.66s)]
*  and they deserved the two games. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1196.58s)]
*  But this is also the worst the Celtics can play. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1198.78s)]
*  And I don't remember the only, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1202.22s)]
*  I remember in 1973, Havlicek hurt his shoulder, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1204.34s)]
*  and the series got blamed on that. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1207.5s)]
*  1982, Tiny hurt his shoulder, and they lost to Philly, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1208.86s)]
*  and the series got blamed on that. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1212.02s)]
*  Even if you go back to 2018, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1215.02s)]
*  when they lost the game seven to LeBron that we went to, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1217.3s)]
*  and nobody could make a shot, right? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1220.46s)]
*  And then you leave the thing, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1222.26s)]
*  and you're like, man, we couldn't make a shot. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1223.22s)]
*  But they still had LeBron. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1224.6599999999999s)]
*  They still had the best guy in the game. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1225.78s)]
*  It was still amazing that the Celtics were in the game seven [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1227.3799999999999s)]
*  and the Eastern Conference finals. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1230.62s)]
*  That Miami game we went to in 23, the game seven, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1232.34s)]
*  when they came back after the white miracle shot, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1235.62s)]
*  and then Tatum hurt his ankle like a minute in, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1238.5s)]
*  and the game flipped. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1241.8999999999999s)]
*  Miami still kicked their ass, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1242.98s)]
*  and Butler was still really good, and Tatum was hurt. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1244.26s)]
*  There were reasons for it. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1248.06s)]
*  I can't come up with reasons for this. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1249.46s)]
*  I can't come up for this team that was built [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1251.34s)]
*  as this offensive machine that wins 75 to 80% of its games [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1253.78s)]
*  just shitting the bed like this two games in a row. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1258.46s)]
*  I've never seen anything like it. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1261.26s)]
*  I know some people are saying [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1262.82s)]
*  the Porzingis illness is really hurting us, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1264.26s)]
*  and I agree with that. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1268.18s)]
*  It hurt us in the fourth quarter, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1270.06s)]
*  because we couldn't go to them. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1271.94s)]
*  They had to take them out. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1274.26s)]
*  You could see he was struggling. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1275.78s)]
*  But it left us with Orford and Cornett. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1278.42s)]
*  Cornett was out there with four minutes left. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1282.82s)]
*  He never plays that late. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1284.62s)]
*  No. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1285.86s)]
*  Our defense in the last eight minutes of the fourth quarter [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1292.58s)]
*  was terrible. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1296.3s)]
*  Yeah, it wasn't great. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1297.58s)]
*  We couldn't stop anybody. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1299.26s)]
*  We couldn't stop Mikhail Bridges, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1301.3s)]
*  who I don't think took three shots [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1302.46s)]
*  in the first three and a half quarters of the game. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1304.22s)]
*  Then all of a sudden they were running plays for him. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1306.94s)]
*  I think he missed his first seven or eight shots, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1308.5s)]
*  and then all of a sudden he's their go-to guy. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1311.78s)]
*  And we can't stop him. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1314.82s)]
*  He's six for 18 to finish the game, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1315.66s)]
*  and I think he made three in a row down the stretch. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1316.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1319.02s)]
*  Brunson is scary. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1320.54s)]
*  I have to say he's really scary. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1321.78s)]
*  When he has the ball, I'm assuming he's gonna score. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1325.34s)]
*  He abused Holliday on that last play, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1328.94s)]
*  the go-ahead basket, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1331.78s)]
*  because he knew it was going to him. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1333.06s)]
*  Usually I'm gonna trust Drew more than anybody [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1334.34s)]
*  in the league on that play, and he used him. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1337.18s)]
*  Obviously I didn't see a replay. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1339.1399999999999s)]
*  Was it a foul? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1342.4199999999998s)]
*  I couldn't see it. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1343.26s)]
*  Yeah, it was a foul. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1344.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1344.9399999999998s)]
*  He kind of over-committed to the move, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1345.78s)]
*  and then he grabbed him as he went behind. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1347.9399999999998s)]
*  Well, that leads me into something else. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1349.9399999999998s)]
*  Okay, it was a foul. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1353.1399999999999s)]
*  But a little bit earlier, twice in a row, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1355.06s)]
*  Coach Joe fouls their center. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1359.34s)]
*  I can't explain that one. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1362.98s)]
*  Can't explain it. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1365.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, I know he's a terrible free-flow shooter, but. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1367.6399999999999s)]
*  But they weren't in the bonus yet. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1371.8s)]
*  They weren't in the bonus. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1373.6399999999999s)]
*  We had two fouls. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1374.48s)]
*  Yeah, and then you get to the final two minutes, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1375.32s)]
*  and you get one foul, and then the second foul, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1377.28s)]
*  and you're good to go. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1379.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1380.32s)]
*  But this wasn't the final two minutes. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1381.8s)]
*  I know. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1383.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1384.44s)]
*  No, trust me. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1385.28s)]
*  It made zero sense. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1386.12s)]
*  I didn't understand it. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1387.24s)]
*  I didn't understand what was happening, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1388.2s)]
*  and we're just putting fouls on random Celtics [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1389.6399999999999s)]
*  for no reason. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1391.84s)]
*  Especially if you think OT, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1393.0s)]
*  I'm looking at the, well, I guess we had some fouls to give. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1395.8s)]
*  Nobody was in major foul trouble. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1399.12s)]
*  But you know, we had two fouls. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1401.24s)]
*  We looked pretty good. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1403.68s)]
*  It wasn't in the two minute period of time. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1406.48s)]
*  No, it was three minutes left. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1409.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1411.28s)]
*  Okay, so it made a difference. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1412.12s)]
*  I didn't get it. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1416.24s)]
*  And then he, so they run the play to Tatum to go up one. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1417.9199999999998s)]
*  Good play. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1421.08s)]
*  Nick's score. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1422.48s)]
*  And then he doesn't call timeout [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1423.48s)]
*  and runs the exact same play. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1424.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1426.6000000000001s)]
*  Which the Knicks are like, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1427.44s)]
*  oh, you're gonna run this play again. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1428.2800000000002s)]
*  We're gonna do this this time. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1429.1200000000001s)]
*  And the spacing on that last play, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1430.96s)]
*  somebody screenshotted it to me. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1433.3200000000002s)]
*  It's one of the worst plays in the history [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1435.76s)]
*  of the Celtics franchise. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1437.4s)]
*  You sent it to me, I saw it. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1438.8000000000002s)]
*  Oh yeah, I sent it to you. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1439.88s)]
*  Tatum goes left. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1440.72s)]
*  He takes three guys with him. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1441.76s)]
*  There's four other teammates on the court. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1443.48s)]
*  Three are on the baseline, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1445.2800000000002s)]
*  and one is standing near him in the paint. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1446.52s)]
*  So there's two Knicks that just have to guard four guys, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1448.8000000000002s)]
*  and then three guys can jump on him. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1451.76s)]
*  They have nobody come to the top of the key. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1453.68s)]
*  White is just hanging on the baseline, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1455.84s)]
*  but he's not cutting. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1457.48s)]
*  And Tatum could have found him underneath the basket, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1458.84s)]
*  and everybody's just kind of standing there. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1460.96s)]
*  I don't even know what they're watching. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1462.6s)]
*  And maybe that's why you don't take the timeout. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1464.44s)]
*  And like, I'm sometimes, don't call timeout, just go. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1467.28s)]
*  You got the momentum of the thing. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1470.8s)]
*  But coming off a free throw, I don't know. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1471.8799999999999s)]
*  I'd much rather call timeout. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1474.96s)]
*  Save the three seconds, bringing the ball up. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1476.8799999999999s)]
*  Like they ended up taking the timeout in the locker room. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1478.8799999999999s)]
*  You have to take the timeout. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1482.36s)]
*  You get the ball at half court. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1483.2s)]
*  You've saved, as you said, at least three seconds. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1484.52s)]
*  But you mentioned how White wasn't cutting. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1487.76s)]
*  Why would he cut? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1492.8s)]
*  You knew Tatum wasn't gonna give the ball up. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1494.1599999999999s)]
*  He won't give the ball up at that moment. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1497.32s)]
*  It's like his Achilles heel over and over and over [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1500.9199999999998s)]
*  at the end of the fourth court. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1504.1599999999999s)]
*  He won't give the ball up. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1505.28s)]
*  And there are guys open, obviously. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1507.3999999999999s)]
*  I saw the same thing you saw. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1509.88s)]
*  And I would have put you out there. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1513.48s)]
*  I would have too. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1515.96s)]
*  I would have, especially I would have called timeout. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1516.8000000000002s)]
*  I would have done a final play with the three guards, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1518.44s)]
*  Tatum and Brown, had better spacing and really tried. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1520.6000000000001s)]
*  This is, your whole season is on the line. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1523.72s)]
*  You're down one. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1525.8000000000002s)]
*  The whole season's on the line. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1526.64s)]
*  In all of the great practices they have [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1528.2s)]
*  at the All Black Arena, don't they have that one play [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1530.3600000000001s)]
*  where they, we call timeout, we need two points. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1535.2s)]
*  We have a play they haven't seen before. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1540.48s)]
*  Let's use it right now. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1542.5200000000002s)]
*  One of the plays they run from time to time [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1546.5200000000002s)]
*  that I always really like is when they pin Tatum [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1548.3200000000002s)]
*  on the foul line and they almost lob the ball into him. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1550.5600000000002s)]
*  And then basically he has this foul line post-up [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1554.64s)]
*  that he can either spin, try to go to the basket, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1556.88s)]
*  get fouled, and he's a good free throw shooter. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1558.92s)]
*  I'd much rather, and then you have the right spacing [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1561.64s)]
*  around him, it's really tough for a second guy [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1563.92s)]
*  to jump over. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1565.6000000000001s)]
*  And then if a second guy comes over, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1566.88s)]
*  now he can kick it out to somebody. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1568.28s)]
*  But you know, after watching Missoula for three years, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1570.24s)]
*  did you expect him to call a timeout? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1573.36s)]
*  No, I think the best quality that he has [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1576.44s)]
*  is also the worst quality. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1578.8s)]
*  Like he likes the test. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1580.12s)]
*  He likes seeing. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1584.8s)]
*  It wasn't the game for the test. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1585.6399999999999s)]
*  No, but I'm saying, but you know what I mean? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1588.48s)]
*  Like he likes when his team is challenged. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1589.68s)]
*  Like I'm sure he was watching the game yesterday. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1592.3999999999999s)]
*  This is great. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1594.44s)]
*  This is gonna make us better down the road [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1595.28s)]
*  that somebody's throwing haymakers at us like this. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1597.04s)]
*  I know, but now they're down 0-2 in the series. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1599.56s)]
*  And now you're playing. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1601.8799999999999s)]
*  Also, it's a Saturday afternoon game. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1603.68s)]
*  It's at 330 ET. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1606.12s)]
*  That's just a weird time. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1607.96s)]
*  That's fine in February, Joe, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1610.08s)]
*  when you wanna have the test. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1612.8s)]
*  But call the timeout, set up that special play [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1614.52s)]
*  that you haven't used, and pin Tatum [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1619.08s)]
*  at the foul line area. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1624.32s)]
*  Well, also protect the lead. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1627.4399999999998s)]
*  This is something I talked on Sunday's pod with Brasila [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1628.96s)]
*  about game seven, Golden State Houston. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1631.6399999999999s)]
*  Every time Houston started to crawl back, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1634.8s)]
*  Kirk called the timeout and he just controlled. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1637.3999999999999s)]
*  He was just like, you guys can crawl back, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1640.6399999999999s)]
*  but I'm not giving you the momentum [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1643.08s)]
*  of like an 8-0 run or 9-0 run. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1644.4399999999998s)]
*  It's never happening. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1646.28s)]
*  Every time I feel like anything's happening, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1647.6799999999998s)]
*  I'm cutting it off. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1649.48s)]
*  And the Celtics, it's way more, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1651.08s)]
*  I hate to use this word, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1654.04s)]
*  because in the wrong context, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1655.1999999999998s)]
*  it's a little insulting, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1657.56s)]
*  but there's been an arrogance to the Celtics team [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1660.56s)]
*  that comes out at the worst possible times. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1663.6799999999998s)]
*  Where it's like, this is who we are. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1666.32s)]
*  We shoot threes. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1667.6799999999998s)]
*  We don't need a timeout. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1668.72s)]
*  We can just get Tatum going in the basket. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1670.3999999999999s)]
*  We're just gonna play Horford, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1672.6799999999998s)]
*  because this is what we do down the stretch. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1673.8799999999999s)]
*  And I really think Pritchard should have been out there [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1675.6399999999999s)]
*  for at least one of those games over Horford. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1678.1599999999999s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1679.68s)]
*  There is an arrogance. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1680.52s)]
*  If you listen to a Missoula's press conferences [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1681.6s)]
*  after the game, after a loss, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1684.04s)]
*  he'll point out the positives. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1686.48s)]
*  He uses the word margins all the time, the margins here. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1689.44s)]
*  We won three of the four quarters. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1693.12s)]
*  Belichick used to do the same thing. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1695.8s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1698.04s)]
*  He lost the game. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1698.8799999999999s)]
*  We'll trust the process. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1699.72s)]
*  Gotta keep going. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1700.56s)]
*  Gotta go to be on a game three. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1702.0s)]
*  In the two games, I know you know this, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1705.72s)]
*  it's unfathomable to me. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1708.36s)]
*  We shot 103 point shots in two games. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1710.52s)]
*  I know. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1714.6s)]
*  60 in game one and 40 in game two. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1715.4399999999998s)]
*  We made 25 of them. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1717.8s)]
*  That's not a recipe for success. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1720.32s)]
*  I thought the biggest sin of either game [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1724.6399999999999s)]
*  was the last two minutes of game one [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1727.84s)]
*  when especially Tatum was just jacking up threes [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1730.4399999999998s)]
*  over trying to get to the basket. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1734.6799999999998s)]
*  Three in a row. Just trying to get the paint. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1736.1999999999998s)]
*  Including that one he took with a minute left. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1737.28s)]
*  That was just awful as he was taking it. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1740.28s)]
*  And he had Mitchell Robinson on him. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1742.2s)]
*  He can just go by that dude every time. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1744.52s)]
*  And we've watched him. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1746.4s)]
*  What was the regular season for? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1747.72s)]
*  This is what he learned during the regular season [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1749.84s)]
*  is just go by those big guys. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1751.56s)]
*  You're gonna be able to get by them. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1753.1200000000001s)]
*  Finish at the rim. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1754.52s)]
*  He's also blowing layups too. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1755.8s)]
*  We missed a bunch of layups yesterday [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1758.52s)]
*  and a bunch of layups in game one. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1760.32s)]
*  Derrick White missed that. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1762.16s)]
*  So that's the question. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1763.76s)]
*  Because Fandl has the Celtics still favored in the series. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1764.6s)]
*  And the question is, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1768.9199999999998s)]
*  are they really gonna shoot that badly [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1770.6399999999999s)]
*  a couple more times? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1774.0s)]
*  I feel like the Knicks are gonna have [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1775.0s)]
*  at least one game out of these next five [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1776.4399999999998s)]
*  where they're awesome. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1778.4399999999998s)]
*  And Towns goes seven for 10 from three. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1780.4399999999998s)]
*  Or Brunson has 45 points. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1783.32s)]
*  The Knicks have a good game in them [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1786.9199999999998s)]
*  that they're gonna win. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1788.7199999999998s)]
*  So at the very least you're looking at a seven gamer. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1789.9199999999998s)]
*  They have to win one of the next three, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1792.24s)]
*  the Celtics, or they go home. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1794.92s)]
*  And then you gotta win three in a row basically. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1796.64s)]
*  The one thing I'm hoping for I guess, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1799.6s)]
*  we've been a very good road team this year. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1804.44s)]
*  We've been a- [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1806.8s)]
*  I'd say better at road than the home. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1807.64s)]
*  Oh, much better road team than home team. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1808.84s)]
*  Which makes no sense because last year [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1811.92s)]
*  in the championship year we were a great home team. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1814.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1817.6s)]
*  We fiddled and diddled. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1819.96s)]
*  Fiddled the plans. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1821.04s)]
*  To use that term, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1822.9599999999998s)]
*  we played around too much this year at home. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1825.1999999999998s)]
*  And the lineups have been kind of weird at times. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1830.36s)]
*  I just thought we'd pull it together, the first two. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1834.52s)]
*  I really was confident that this was such a must-win game. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1837.12s)]
*  There was no way we would let the Knicks go up to nothing. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1841.9599999999998s)]
*  Well, so there's a couple other things in stake, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1845.2399999999998s)]
*  big picture that we just have to acknowledge. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1847.1599999999999s)]
*  The Knicks, New York, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1850.6s)]
*  the Celtics have won all these titles. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1854.8799999999999s)]
*  The Knicks have a 1-1 in 52 years. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1856.52s)]
*  The Knicks have, the last kind of great playoff moment [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1860.6399999999999s)]
*  they had against the Celtics was that 1990 game [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1863.6399999999999s)]
*  that you and I went to and Bird missed the dunk [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1866.28s)]
*  and Ewing hit the three in the corner. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1868.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1870.08s)]
*  They had some good ones in the early 70s. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1870.9199999999998s)]
*  They won a couple series. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1873.3999999999999s)]
*  The 84 Bernard versus Larry, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1874.76s)]
*  the Celtics win that one in game seven. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1876.8s)]
*  But then there's this whole, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1880.52s)]
*  a lot of Knicks fans are also Yankee fans. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1881.56s)]
*  And there's really since the 04, the comeback. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1884.36s)]
*  And now it feels like the Knicks [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1889.28s)]
*  knocked the Celtics out out of nowhere [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1891.7199999999998s)]
*  where they're doing four or five. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1893.48s)]
*  And now all of a sudden the Knicks fans [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1894.9599999999998s)]
*  and the New York fans, and we know a lot of them, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1897.12s)]
*  all of a sudden get their swagger back. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1899.48s)]
*  I'm dreading that more than anything, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1901.0s)]
*  even though I like the Knicks fans. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1902.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you a quick story from last night's game. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1903.24s)]
*  One really annoying, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1906.6399999999999s)]
*  I know the Celtics draw really well in the road. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1908.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1911.84s)]
*  It's probably annoying to those teams in Dallas or wherever. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1912.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1916.28s)]
*  It was really annoying last night [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1917.3999999999999s)]
*  to see how many Knicks fans were there at the game. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1919.28s)]
*  It's obvious that after game one, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1922.4799999999998s)]
*  a lot of season ticket holders sold their seats [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1924.56s)]
*  for game two, because you had the blue and the orange, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1926.9599999999998s)]
*  the terrible colors that you notice all over the arena. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1931.56s)]
*  And then walking out in the stairs, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1936.3999999999999s)]
*  there were Knicks fans chanting. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1938.9599999999998s)]
*  And there was a pretty huge Celtic fan [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1941.4799999999998s)]
*  who went up to one of them and said, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1944.9599999999998s)]
*  "'You say one more word and you're going down the stairs.'" [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1946.6799999999998s)]
*  And that was the end of it. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1950.3999999999999s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1951.4799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1952.4399999999998s)]
*  So the Knicks guy kind of ran quickly down the stairs [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1953.28s)]
*  and he could get out of there. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1955.6s)]
*  I mean, the Celtic fans were really upset. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1958.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1960.76s)]
*  And there were too many Knicks fans chanting. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1961.6s)]
*  It was terrible. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1964.6399999999999s)]
*  Sounds like a fun walk home. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1966.8799999999999s)]
*  No, and then the fire alarm went off. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1968.28s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1970.24s)]
*  Yeah, it was bizarre. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1971.24s)]
*  The whole ending of the game was bizarre. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1973.8799999999999s)]
*  When you left, did you think you were gonna see [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1975.3999999999999s)]
*  the Celtics team again? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1977.0s)]
*  Yeah, I thought I'd see them game five, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1979.12s)]
*  possibly down three to one. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1982.68s)]
*  Yep. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1986.68s)]
*  I knew my son wouldn't be there, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1987.52s)]
*  but I cannot believe we won't take one of two games [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1989.36s)]
*  in New York, but I don't know. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=1998.3999999999999s)]
*  The early start on Saturday, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2001.4799999999998s)]
*  I don't know if that's good or bad. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2002.9599999999998s)]
*  The crowd's gonna be great, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2004.28s)]
*  but the good thing for the Celtics is [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2005.52s)]
*  there's gonna be a lot of money in that arena [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2009.08s)]
*  and it might be a lot of, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2010.84s)]
*  maybe not, won't be as quite as raucous of a crowd [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2012.84s)]
*  as normal. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2015.84s)]
*  There's a specific referee we'd like for Saturday [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2016.6799999999998s)]
*  not Mark Davis. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2020.04s)]
*  Who's the, give me your top three referees [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2021.1599999999999s)]
*  you don't wanna see. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2022.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2024.1599999999999s)]
*  Your guy Foster's back. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2025.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, we haven't seen him. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2027.8s)]
*  He was injured for two months. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2028.6399999999999s)]
*  Oh, is that why? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2029.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2030.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'd like to see him because [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2032.84s)]
*  he's good with your road team on the line. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2035.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he's good when you're down in the series. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2036.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's got Foster. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2038.72s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2040.56s)]
*  It's got Foster on. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2041.3999999999999s)]
*  So if they blow this series, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2042.52s)]
*  do you feel like this then gets tied into last year [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2044.84s)]
*  and people start the whole thing of, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2048.44s)]
*  well, the only reason you won last year [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2050.84s)]
*  was because everyone was hurt and you got lucky. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2052.2000000000003s)]
*  And then the league got better this year [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2054.44s)]
*  and you didn't show up. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2056.08s)]
*  I do feel like it opens, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2056.92s)]
*  I don't personally believe them, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2058.4s)]
*  but it opens these storylines. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2059.44s)]
*  Tatum, see, this is why he got benched. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2062.12s)]
*  All this bad shit comes out of this. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2064.16s)]
*  Yeah, it does. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2066.28s)]
*  I mean, you're gonna have some of, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2067.12s)]
*  well, they won last year despite the coach. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2068.64s)]
*  The coach lets them shoot 103 point shots in two games [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2072.44s)]
*  when they're not making the shots. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2076.4s)]
*  Doesn't make adjustments at all during the game. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2078.84s)]
*  They have no plan B. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2081.04s)]
*  They don't get creative at all. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2082.16s)]
*  Doesn't call a timeout and say, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2084.08s)]
*  hey guys, we're just not shooting well. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2085.48s)]
*  Could we go to the basket? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2088.16s)]
*  Is that too much to ask? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2089.7599999999998s)]
*  Or you brought up a critical point before. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2091.56s)]
*  When the other team is making a run, call a timeout. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2094.88s)]
*  Stop the momentum. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2097.92s)]
*  We don't do that. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2099.48s)]
*  And then not taking the timeout last night. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2101.2799999999997s)]
*  I understand his philosophy. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2103.56s)]
*  Win the moment, maybe. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2106.0s)]
*  Except it was a made free throw. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2108.88s)]
*  It's coming off of free throws though. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2110.7200000000003s)]
*  You call a timeout at that point. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2111.96s)]
*  Yeah, you do. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2113.16s)]
*  It wasn't like the Knicks missed a shot [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2114.0s)]
*  and we had the momentum going down. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2115.76s)]
*  You know what you definitely don't do [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2117.7200000000003s)]
*  is don't call a timeout and then run the exact same play. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2118.7200000000003s)]
*  Even Tibbs in the press conference after is like, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2122.12s)]
*  yeah, we figured they were probably gonna try [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2124.48s)]
*  to run that play again. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2126.0s)]
*  It's like, yeah, I bet you did. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2126.92s)]
*  Do you blame the new owner, Bill Chisholm? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2129.0s)]
*  No, but how did they call it? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2131.6s)]
*  They didn't call a timeout. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2133.32s)]
*  So how come we were in the exact same play? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2134.8s)]
*  Who told Tatum to do that again? [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2137.1200000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2139.5600000000004s)]
*  Well, and if you're gonna run the same play, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2140.4s)]
*  you have to have, somebody's gotta pop up to the top [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2141.76s)]
*  in case he gets trapped or doubled. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2145.48s)]
*  We didn't run the same. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2147.2400000000002s)]
*  Maybe he thought he was gonna run the same play, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2148.6800000000003s)]
*  but the middle got clogged and he ended up in the left, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2150.6000000000004s)]
*  almost out of bounds area. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2154.44s)]
*  I couldn't even see him. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2156.5600000000004s)]
*  He was so far out on the left. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2157.6800000000003s)]
*  Do you have the proper animosity for the Knicks [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2159.96s)]
*  after watching them two games? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2162.84s)]
*  Or is it like a likable opponent? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2164.04s)]
*  No, it's a likable, I mean, I have no animosity. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2166.8s)]
*  They've played clean. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2170.36s)]
*  I admire- [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2174.28s)]
*  You know, like Orlando was rubbing your last nerve there. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2175.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2177.52s)]
*  After a couple of games. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2178.36s)]
*  I thought they played dirty, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2179.2s)]
*  but I don't think the Knicks played dirty. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2180.02s)]
*  I will say that I didn't realize how good Hart is. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2181.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2185.8s)]
*  He's made such a difference for them. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2187.0s)]
*  He keeps the momentum going. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2189.28s)]
*  He gets that rebound. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2191.08s)]
*  They have to have, he makes a key shot in the corner. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2192.28s)]
*  So he's impressed me. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2198.32s)]
*  Brunson has always impressed me. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2199.7200000000003s)]
*  That guy is, I can't believe Dallas gave up on that guy [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2203.1600000000003s)]
*  or didn't resign him. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2206.2000000000003s)]
*  Townes pisses me off because he's got body language I hate. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2208.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2212.76s)]
*  And without Porzingis, we're having trouble. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2214.28s)]
*  When they have the two bigs in, they have their two bigs in [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2217.6000000000004s)]
*  and we have Cornette and Orphan in, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2220.64s)]
*  it doesn't quite match up well. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2223.08s)]
*  Yeah, but that's where you need Tatum [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2226.3599999999997s)]
*  to basically point center it a little bit or- [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2227.56s)]
*  Well, and Tatum got, you know, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2230.2s)]
*  he's getting defensive rebounds, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2231.8399999999997s)]
*  but it's not helping us scoring at all. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2233.64s)]
*  Well, we'll see. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2236.96s)]
*  This is certainly, this Tatum era- [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2237.7999999999997s)]
*  Are you confident? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2240.16s)]
*  Do you think we're gonna come back to two? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2241.0s)]
*  It's the first time I honestly don't know what to think [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2244.48s)]
*  because they took all the shots that normally took [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2247.44s)]
*  and none of them went in [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2251.38s)]
*  and they just shit the bed two games in a row [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2254.3s)]
*  in the last four minutes. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2257.14s)]
*  And each of them just might've been these separate flukes [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2258.52s)]
*  that exist next to each other or something's wrong. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2261.22s)]
*  And the only thing that makes me nervous is the, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2265.02s)]
*  Porzingis thing's a real thing. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2267.62s)]
*  Cause that's, there's just a, you know, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2269.5s)]
*  it's a domino effect of not just that, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2273.18s)]
*  but the extra whore for minutes. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2275.18s)]
*  Then you have Hauser. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2276.34s)]
*  So the rotation all of a sudden got thinner [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2277.42s)]
*  and now when the rotations that thin, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2281.38s)]
*  if Tatum's gonna suck in a game, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2282.2200000000003s)]
*  now it feels like three times worse [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2283.78s)]
*  cause not a lot of backup options, you know? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2285.78s)]
*  I thought Drew and White played, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2288.46s)]
*  like they were playing pretty hard in that game. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2290.34s)]
*  It's not, I don't expect a ton more from those guys. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2292.2200000000003s)]
*  And I think Jalen's 85%, you watched him all year. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2294.7s)]
*  He's not as explosive as he was in November. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2298.42s)]
*  He's pretty, no, maybe not, but- [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2302.86s)]
*  90%? I don't know. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2306.2s)]
*  I don't think that's what hurt him last night. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2307.04s)]
*  It's the consistent issue he has with bad hands. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2309.46s)]
*  When they blew that two on one layup, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2315.7400000000002s)]
*  and they clapped each other, you know? [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2319.86s)]
*  He can't do that in a critical game too. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2322.26s)]
*  All right, so you're confident or you think it's over? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2325.6200000000003s)]
*  I don't think it's over [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2328.98s)]
*  cause I think we're a really good road team. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2329.9s)]
*  It will not shock me if we take both games in New York, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2333.1400000000003s)]
*  but I'd hate to see us lose Saturday. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2337.4s)]
*  And then we're in the same boat. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2343.64s)]
*  We were two years ago against Miami. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2344.8s)]
*  Miami thing, yeah. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2346.72s)]
*  And to come back and win four straight, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2347.68s)]
*  no one's ever done it, right? [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2351.32s)]
*  In basketball. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2353.52s)]
*  I just can't believe we're here. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2355.8s)]
*  I can't believe we're here. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2357.04s)]
*  It's funny though, I wasn't even that mad last night. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2361.44s)]
*  Cause they won last year, so you gotta factor that in. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2365.56s)]
*  It's like, all right, keep it in perspective. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2368.56s)]
*  We did win the title last year. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2370.28s)]
*  But I was more confused. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2371.76s)]
*  I was just like, I just spent six months watching this team. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2374.32s)]
*  What is happening? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2378.64s)]
*  It was one of those. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2379.68s)]
*  It was like, if you're just watching TV with your wife [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2380.52s)]
*  and then all of a sudden she starts speaking [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2383.56s)]
*  another language and you're like, what's going on? [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2385.04s)]
*  That was how I felt for both games. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2387.88s)]
*  Like, what are you guys doing? [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2389.6s)]
*  Yeah, I understand that. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2391.8s)]
*  And I felt somewhat the same way, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2393.92s)]
*  but consistently the last eight minutes [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2396.36s)]
*  of the fourth quarter, we don't play the same way [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2399.2000000000003s)]
*  as the first 40 minutes or whatever. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2401.96s)]
*  And I don't understand why. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2405.84s)]
*  And the only person I can point my finger at is the coach. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2408.0s)]
*  Coach, these are players. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2414.2400000000002s)]
*  They need some direction. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2417.1600000000003s)]
*  If they're shooting too many threes [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2418.6800000000003s)]
*  and they're not going into the basket, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2420.2799999999997s)]
*  make them go to the basket. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2421.8799999999997s)]
*  Sounds like you're gonna demote them [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2422.9599999999996s)]
*  to second row again. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2424.16s)]
*  I need to be careful here. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2426.7999999999997s)]
*  Dad, I'm gonna see you for game seven, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2429.3599999999997s)]
*  Monday night, May 19th. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2431.04s)]
*  I'll be here. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2432.9599999999996s)]
*  Save my seat. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2433.9199999999996s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2435.0s)]
*  All right, I'll talk to you this weekend. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2435.9199999999996s)]
*  Bye. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iao5XnRXcNw&t=2437.16s)]
