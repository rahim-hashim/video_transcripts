# A Shocking KnicksWolves Trade Could Make or Break Karl-Anthony Towns  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [September 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkD22HA_4OQ)
*  All right. We're taping this Saturday afternoon Pacific time.
*  There was a huge NBA trade last night.
*  I was at a dinner party.
*  I was having drinks.
*  My phone started blowing up.
*  I'm like, what the hell?
*  I see the trade and all of a sudden text after text.
*  And I'm just going, I'm not doing this.
*  I'm putting my phone away.
*  I'm going to read about this tomorrow.
*  And then was reading about it today a little bit.
*  And I'm like, what the fuck was this trade?
*  And I'm battling on it.
*  You texted me and you're like, yeah, what the fuck was this?
*  And we just decided to hop on the pot and talk about it.
*  Austin Rivers is here.
*  You have a special bonus.
*  You played with Towns.
*  So we'll go.
*  I want a quick question and then I have a big picture.
*  Eight questions for you.
*  But quick question.
*  Now that you've sat with it for a few hours,
*  do you feel like one or the other won this trade?
*  If I had to choose, I would say the Knicks.
*  Okay. Tell me why.
*  And I might.
*  At the end of the day, I do think Carl Anthony Towns
*  is an upgrade from Julius Randall.
*  I think Julius Randall is a fabulous player,
*  a really good player.
*  But Carl Anthony Towns is, I think, a different level.
*  And then you add to that his abilities, I think,
*  align with what they need in terms of spacing the floor.
*  You have a big that's going to be able to do that.
*  The pick and pop game, I think, with Jalen Brunson
*  is going to be fantastic.
*  Carl is highly skilled, doesn't need the ball in his hands a lot.
*  He's more going to shoot or he's going to make a move right away.
*  Yeah.
*  I think Julius is a guy that you throw the ball down to
*  and you got to watch him take his time.
*  He takes time to get his baskets.
*  He needs rhythm dribbles, multiple jab fakes, multiple pump fakes.
*  It's almost like it's tiring watching him score.
*  You actually commend him for having the conditioning to do it.
*  So I think that's what they wanted to do.
*  I think they made that decision when they paid OG.
*  They paid him $200 million.
*  They're like the same position, but they're different types of players.
*  So they're saying kind of they're going that route
*  because he's not a three.
*  I don't like OG at the three.
*  I like him as an undersized kind of four,
*  especially in today's NBA.
*  So yeah, it's interesting.
*  I don't know.
*  I think they would win.
*  I get why people like me and Shinzo.
*  I'm going the other way.
*  I'm zagging.
*  And I don't even know if I feel like I'm not going to be like,
*  mark this down, put it in magic marker.
*  I'm right on this.
*  But as I sat with it for a few hours, I actually liked it more from Minnesota
*  because they got out of that Towns Bunny.
*  And I don't know if the way the team was constructed with the ownership
*  in flux with how much money they're going to have to spend on Edwards.
*  They have to keep go bear just in general, then to pay towns, 220 million for four years.
*  When I don't know what your ceiling is for him.
*  And now you flip them into Randall for a year.
*  You get the Fuenchenzo who is can be your sixth man.
*  Who's a proven guy who can finish games and you have more flexibility.
*  Nas can get the towns minutes.
*  And it just makes sense to me.
*  But the Randall piece is the part I can't figure out.
*  Okay.
*  So I'm leaning Minnesota.
*  You're leaning next.
*  But I want to have to.
*  By the way, I'm not saying like don't put that a magic marker.
*  That was just my lane.
*  Eight questions.
*  First one.
*  Why now for the Knicks?
*  Why right before training camp?
*  Where was the patience?
*  Because I remember I was talking to a Knicks like three days ago.
*  Next buddy of mine.
*  And I'm like, I kind of like that the Knicks are saying we don't know what our roster is yet.
*  We lost heart and steam.
*  We might not have Robinson for three months.
*  We don't really have a center, but we don't have to figure this out now.
*  It's 82 games plus four rounds in the playoffs.
*  Let's see how this goes and we'll make a move.
*  And now all of a sudden, they're just this is it.
*  They're committed to now this roster.
*  So why now?
*  What happened?
*  I think the only thing you could hang your hat on in this sense would be what other big are we going to be?
*  I think Carl was made available and they're probably thinking what other big are
*  we going to get of this guy's caliber?
*  Right.
*  So you look at like the Vuchovic.
*  Yeah, it's like this is best case scenario right now.
*  We're going to wait till the season and hopefully get someone better than Carl.
*  Carl's like probably the third, fourth best center in the league.
*  So it's like, you know, at this point, you're just like, you know, let's move somebody.
*  I don't think even Chenzel was a guy they wanted to take, you know, or, you know, make a part of the deal.
*  But that was the only way it was going to get done.
*  That was my feeling as well, because I'm thinking like on the one hand, this deal is there for
*  Minnesota in January, right?
*  They're still doing it because they can get off the town's money.
*  The only way it's not there in January is if Minnesota comes out like gangbusters,
*  Dillingham's good right away.
*  They're like 24 and five after 29 games.
*  They're like, yeah, we're actually not going to mess with this.
*  My guess, and I don't know, I asked around, I was trying to find out and I still feel like
*  my bet would be New Orleans, but my guess was another team was creeping around towns
*  and it became a shit off the pot thing with the Knicks.
*  They're probably talking for a couple of weeks with the Knicks and Minnesota saying,
*  we're not doing this without DTV.
*  He's got to be in it.
*  Nick's like, wow, we can't do that.
*  We'll put what about Robinson?
*  We'll do Robinson and Randall and we'll throw whatever out.
*  They're like, no, we want DTV.
*  Like, wow, we can't do it.
*  So then maybe around Wednesday, Thursday, get New Orleans.
*  Maybe they're like, hey, Brandon Ingram and we have picks and can we get towns?
*  Because they don't have a center either.
*  Maybe it's the Clippers.
*  Maybe it's Houston offering a three for one.
*  I don't think it was Golden State because I don't think Golden State want to be in the
*  town's business.
*  But does that make sense to you that maybe a second team or maybe they use somebody as
*  a stocking horse to make the Knicks do that trade?
*  That's all it takes.
*  All it takes is for one other person to like you or have interest in it.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Then suddenly it's now it's okay.
*  Now we got a war here.
*  We got to make a decision here.
*  You might go.
*  You might go to New Orleans tomorrow.
*  New Orleans is talking and things are progressing.
*  I mean, that's like the language that happens in the front office.
*  It's always those type of words and people just kind of make a decision.
*  I would have liked them to go to the season and just seen what worked, what did it, who
*  fit in, who did it.
*  Devin Chinzo is a very underrated loss.
*  I don't think people understand the shooting he provided the Knicks.
*  I know he's a good hustle player.
*  I know he made all the little things.
*  That's great.
*  Those are not overlooked things, but they have a guy, Josh Hart who does that.
*  The difference is no one on that team can shoot the ball like Devin Chinzo, especially
*  after last year where he was shooting it and not only where, how he shoots.
*  He's a catch and shoot guy.
*  Catch and shoot quick shot.
*  But Kels a rhythm shooter.
*  Josh Hart's not a shooter.
*  He does a lot of the other things in terms of spacing that concerns me.
*  There are two guard spots.
*  Josh Hart's going to start.
*  You've got to hope Josh shoots above 37, 38% there.
*  They're going to need him to be around that mark.
*  Well, but they would say towns would be the extra spacing because they weren't going to
*  have a space thing.
*  So that's the switch for sure.
*  And that's the upgrade.
*  That's where they get that.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's why I said the Knicks kind of when you told me to choose, I went the next side
*  just due to the fact that at least you didn't love it though.
*  I don't love it.
*  I don't love it.
*  I don't know if I had to pick.
*  Can we talk about DDB for a second?
*  Because that's such a big part of this trade.
*  I'm so glad you said that he was 18 a game and 43% three point shooting last year.
*  Crunch time guy.
*  Fearless.
*  Yeah.
*  Prove that he can play big minutes and big games with big States on the road or at home.
*  Right.
*  Wasn't like anybody else they had.
*  And I think it's a huge loss for them not to mention RIP the Villanova four.
*  I had this as the third question.
*  Like we didn't even get to see the four Villanova guys together.
*  That's something.
*  We just saw them and just saw their pictures next to each other.
*  That was it.
*  Crazy.
*  That's how I know.
*  Just by based off of Carl Anthony Towns reaction, the dot dot dot.
*  I think both sides were stunned that this happened.
*  We've seen all of this hoopla around Villanova having this pretty much the Villanova Knicks.
*  All those guys have a history of high success.
*  Obviously at the college level, they got a coach that seems in line with how they play
*  and who they are.
*  Tibbito.
*  A real chemistry that you have when you've played with dudes that you grew up with.
*  I thought that was really special.
*  Those three guys, you put me and my four college dudes together that I won a national title with
*  on an NBA team and we're going to be playing like it's you know what I mean?
*  Like that's going to be natural from day one.
*  So that's it was disappointing to hear that he's in that.
*  And then he's the best shooter on the team.
*  So again, they got Carl Anthony Towns, which is great.
*  But like, man, if I'm guarding Josh Hart and Brunson's right here on the top of the key
*  where he likes to operate, he likes to operate on his one on one.
*  I'm right there in load side, man.
*  Like, yeah, you got to you got to pass the Josh, you know, where before I'm like hugged
*  up on even chins.
*  If I gave him one second, that ball is launched.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  At a high clip.
*  That's a big deal.
*  They lost a lot.
*  But on the flip side, they had no center and I don't know if we can make that exactly
*  strong enough.
*  They must have really felt like Robinson.
*  You know, it's like, oh, it could be two months like in NBA time, two months could be six
*  months.
*  We're doing this with Porzingis now.
*  They're like December.
*  Now they're like, might be November.
*  And then it's like, it could be February.
*  You just don't.
*  It's like a three month range or whatever date.
*  So they were going to have to play basically Randall and Ananobe at center got Randall
*  in a contract here now playing out of position who seemed unhappy anyway.
*  And that goes back to the this question of where was the patience?
*  Why now?
*  Yep.
*  I feel and you know, I might have might have heard a couple things too about this.
*  I feel like there was some real chemistry concerns with Randall that, you know, bring
*  him in under, you know, as, as kind of the, the ugly stepchild of this Villanova four team.
*  And he's over there and he's underpaid by the fact that he's a top 50 guy.
*  He's going to have to play out of position.
*  Brunson is going to have the ball at the time and they must have not like something,
*  right?
*  That's that's fair.
*  Well, it's like, you know, it's always hard for a player, especially a star player when
*  things don't go to plan.
*  And the plan was never for Brunson to be the best player.
*  I mean, when they traded for him, they thought he was going to be a good player.
*  I don't think anybody thought Brunson was going to be this level of a player where he's like
*  an MVP candidate in the top point.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like could he be a top three guy and an excellent team?
*  Yeah.
*  Like, and now we have these answers where before people thought they were crazy for
*  giving him a hundred million.
*  So now we're here where he has a new friendly contract that he did, which was crazy.
*  But this guy's the guy.
*  Julius has had to take a natural backseat.
*  He misses games last year.
*  OG plays.
*  They go like 23 and four, some crazy number.
*  I don't know what it was.
*  So it's like they have this success without him and reminds me of like the Boston Kyrie
*  thing.
*  Like they were really good without him.
*  So when he came back, we were like, we don't really know if we want him or like we have
*  young guys.
*  Yeah.
*  What is this team now?
*  This is weird.
*  And then they pay OG, who I know is like a three, four tweener, but it's like 200 million,
*  man.
*  You know, that was a decision right then and there where they're like, this is kind of
*  where we're headed.
*  You know, if I'm a two guard and someone pays like another scoring guard, 200 million,
*  I was like, well, what's their plans for me?
*  Right.
*  I mean, like long term, they keep them both of us.
*  You know, like who's finishing the game?
*  Are we playing small?
*  No, we can't play small.
*  We can't play both of us together with Josh.
*  We have no shooting.
*  So it's like it was a decision right then and there.
*  And again, I think they panic.
*  Like you said, someone might had an interest in Carl and they're like, yo, we need a center.
*  We need a center now.
*  Carl's the best available.
*  And by the way, Carl's a really good player.
*  We got to lose the even shit that we got to lose.
*  And maybe we could figure out some shooting.
*  They got big bride.
*  They got some other guys that could shoot the ball.
*  You could always kind of maybe find shooting here and there.
*  After all, they did find even chintzo.
*  No one thought he could shoot like that before he came to New York.
*  So, you know, I think we get Carl.
*  Fundamentally, they're looking at last year's team and they're like,
*  Towns replaces the Fuenchenzo basically.
*  He's pretty much in heart and son.
*  Right.
*  And the Mitchell thing, the bridges, nobody's like bridges.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That was added.
*  So I guess bridges would replace the DV and then, and then towns replace heart and
*  Stein and both of those guys are better than the guys replacing.
*  Now they gave up every asset they had to get to that point.
*  Yeah.
*  But fundamentally, that's what it is.
*  That's why I go to New York.
*  Well, the thing is, theoretically, it's like, this is one of those theoretical teams now
*  where you look at them and you go, man, shearing everywhere.
*  They're kind of built like the Celtics, right?
*  Two really good two way rings, a stretch five who can actually shoot 40%.
*  Somebody who can handle the ball in crunch time and they can run the offense through.
*  And there's just threats everywhere of Josh Hart.
*  Unless he just goes sideways with his three.
*  Yeah.
*  Defensively, their wings, like you said, man, that is to have Mikel, Josh and OG
*  all out there at the same time on the floor.
*  When you talk about like 50, 50 balls and rebounds and all that, like they're going
*  to dominate because that's what those guys do for a living.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like they're going to be a very, this is a tip.
*  This is a typical dream team if I've ever seen one, you know what I mean?
*  Well, except for the nightmare of coaching towns again, because those guys didn't like
*  it.
*  That's that's also interesting, too.
*  This dynamic of him back with with the.
*  I mean, especially after I've been I played for the Knicks, I played for tips and I play
*  with Carl.
*  The fit is unique.
*  I know that's going to be interesting.
*  I wouldn't say this is peaches in her Brie United.
*  Just a lot of love on stage.
*  Just a lot of romance.
*  I think this is there's going to be a lot of good acting.
*  You know, I talked to Carl.
*  We hashed we hashed things out a couple of years ago.
*  We know we kept it between us, but I think we're in a really good place.
*  Like what is what else is Tibbs going to say?
*  Yeah, I hate a coach and we fought all the time.
*  We did.
*  You know, Carl was young and immature and I was on his ass all the time and we never
*  really clicked.
*  But now he's older.
*  Like what else are you going to say?
*  Now he's older, maybe he's more mature.
*  You know, personality wise, they don't even like just know both of them.
*  They just don't even.
*  That doesn't make.
*  But again, like you said, man, we're going to play the understatement of the century.
*  The town's personality and the tips personality.
*  I'm going to say what are those two guys having?
*  Well, it's it's it's complete opposites, polar opposites.
*  But you like towns.
*  I do like them.
*  I think you like you like playing.
*  I think he's a nice guy.
*  I think he's vastly misunderstood.
*  I get I get what's frustrating about him.
*  Some of the things he does in the game as a coach, you want to like pull your hair out.
*  Like just like some decisions he makes, the fouling, some of the stuff you do,
*  you're just like Carl, why?
*  It's like the same thing.
*  The fouling 35 feet from the basket when he already has four fouls and he just crashes.
*  He has a history of just the silly fouling amongst some other things.
*  But he's the worst silly Fowler.
*  He's the ghost of silly fouling.
*  I don't know in NBA history who's been worse than him with timing, the dumbness of the foul.
*  We overlook it.
*  Of it.
*  Do the talent.
*  You know what I mean?
*  He's so good.
*  He is so talented.
*  He is so fucking good, bro.
*  But he's he's one of those guys that we see on Twitter with the 25 years from now.
*  Carl Anthony Towns was a problem.
*  He shot 40 percent and it's like, yeah, he was a problem, but he was also a problem
*  if you're trying to win the title.
*  So he's that leads to the second question.
*  You got to clean up some stuff.
*  My second question was Carl Anthony Towns in New York City with Knicks fans.
*  Is there a more exciting NBA subplot right now?
*  Because this could go every direction.
*  Either way.
*  I'm going to go for him because he's good.
*  If that dude laces him up, you know, one thing they'll appreciate is if you play good,
*  you know what I mean?
*  If he's out there shooting 40 percent, dropping 20 a night, they don't love Carl.
*  They don't love Carl.
*  There are going to be times where that, you know, Carl's got to be prepared to play in
*  that type of atmosphere.
*  You know, I mean, he's a different type of guy emotionally, personality wise.
*  He's been in Minnesota his entire career.
*  This is a huge stage for him.
*  This is a different stage.
*  You were always on the young bad team that was like up and coming.
*  And then last year, you all really got there.
*  But now you are thrown in a team that's like we're trying to win right now with a coach
*  that expects right now to coach.
*  Historically, we know you and him weren't the greatest.
*  That's an understatement.
*  And now you're being with him again on the biggest Broadway show in basketball sports.
*  I mean, this is this is what it is.
*  So it's like it is a very interesting dynamic.
*  I mean, well, on the one side, incredible situation for him, right?
*  Because conceivably in towns, I think I've probably been of anybody who has a relatively
*  big platform, probably the most frustrated with him.
*  Rosilla might be number one.
*  Maybe I'm number two, but just the talents there.
*  And you just he's one of those.
*  When's he going to get it?
*  When's he going to get it?
*  And they were real signs for last year.
*  Right.
*  But then you look at him with this next team, the best version of him is as a stretch five
*  on a team that thing that can then handle some of the rebounding and some of the defense
*  for him.
*  So he doesn't have to be a traditional center.
*  Right.
*  Yep.
*  That's the next in and we can really help.
*  And it will be can in some ways almost be like the surrogate center with some bigger
*  guys and guard some big dudes or you have the pick and roll piece with Brunson.
*  It's just a better situation than putting it with Rudy Gobert.
*  Just this.
*  And then the shooting and the spacing.
*  And if he can ever figure out some sort of pick and roll thing with Brunson, you've got
*  that bigger stage.
*  Like you said, it's a bigger stage that you can't compare Minnesota to New York City.
*  You know, it's like every single game is a play is like a playoff game in Minnesota
*  that he's going to play in New York.
*  And if he's good, the fans are going to love him.
*  If he starts doing weird town stuff, he's going to become super polarizing.
*  It happened to Randall and it'll be, I think, worse.
*  Right.
*  And Randall was not exactly Mr. Popularity.
*  Which is crazy.
*  And this just tells you the amount of pressure it is to play for that city.
*  You know, what was what was Randall?
*  Twenty six and seven a night.
*  Right.
*  Like this is a guy putting up some phenomenal numbers for you guys, man.
*  Like Knicks fans.
*  I mean, just just the general idea of like they hated a guy who gave him 25 a night.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like that concept, it's hard to like in player terms, you just start thinking like, wow,
*  you know, I mean, like the pressure of that.
*  I know Julius is probably relieved in some ways.
*  Probably let me get out of here, go play somewhere else.
*  Like this has not been great for me.
*  I've had great moments.
*  You know, I mean, I've really broke out my shell here.
*  This is where it came together for me as a as an NBA star.
*  You know, in some ways he probably is going to look at New York.
*  You have to look at his success.
*  If you're Julius before you were in New Orleans and L.A.
*  trying to find your way, it wasn't really working.
*  Then you go to New York and become an All-Star.
*  So it was very, you know, pivotal for him to have a stage to do that.
*  You get to do that in New York and now he probably gets away from that.
*  It's a little toxic at this point.
*  I had some rational Knicks fans in my life who were like, I just don't like them.
*  I don't like the faces he makes.
*  I just don't like the ball stopper.
*  Yeah, Julius, I don't.
*  I'm glad you don't.
*  I don't like the look on his face.
*  I think he I think he's a black hole.
*  I don't get it.
*  I don't think he's a winning player.
*  And then when he got hurt and they played better without him,
*  all the people felt that way were like, see, he's telling you the whole time.
*  Just yeah, just sometimes you're one injury away from being great.
*  We had that injury and I just needed him in the playoffs.
*  They did.
*  They did need him in the playoffs.
*  They were down to four players.
*  They needed.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Brunson Brunson had to do a lot at that point and he could have used Julius.
*  But you know what?
*  I'm glad you said the ball stopper comic because I'm a fan of Julius's game.
*  You know, he's a very talented player, hardworking guy,
*  one of the hardworking players I ever play with.
*  But his style of play, like you said, man, he takes his time.
*  You know, he he is I don't want to call him a black hole, but like, listen,
*  he's a scorer.
*  It's called they're all black holes.
*  They're all ball hogs.
*  All the best scores in the leagues are right.
*  Any guys averaging about 22 points a game is a ball hog, bro.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Like just for the most part, unless you're like a Nicole Yocage type guy
*  who's plays in a whole different way.
*  Everybody else, they get the ball.
*  And they require a lot of dribbles and a lot of time.
*  And Julius is definitely one of those guys.
*  Right.
*  Like Brandon Ingram is another one of those guys, certain guys.
*  Yes.
*  That's why when you put them in the international, when the ball has to move
*  and the flow is different, those guys really struggle.
*  And that's why this for Minnesota, bro.
*  I don't know.
*  I'm going to let you ask your questions because that might be.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, two more things on towns.
*  First of all, the contract 49.5 this year, 53.1, 57.1,
*  61.0 player option.
*  So to say that to say the Knicks are pot committed would be an understatement.
*  And they got bridges coming.
*  Bridge is going to be basically a free agent in 26 and he's going to be another 40 minutes.
*  So this is like they traded on their picks.
*  Yeah.
*  Dolan.
*  He's going for it.
*  He's going for it.
*  But you think about, so we do the ringer 100, right?
*  Where we, we, um, we, everybody ranks, we aggregate the rankings.
*  And I had towns this last list.
*  I just handed in towns was 32 on my list, 32nd best player in the week.
*  Randall had 45th.
*  Okay.
*  And Dante was 93rd.
*  So they basically took 45 and 93 and their last Detroit pick.
*  That's not even 90.
*  Who knows if that's even ever be a first rounder to move up to 32.
*  Right.
*  So you look at that and you go, well, that's not, but that's not why they did it.
*  They did it because of the shooting and because they needed the center
*  and because theoretically this should be an awesome team.
*  I just, the question for me that everyone loved that next team last year, the
*  overachieving such a tips team, all the Villanova guys.
*  And now you bring bridges in her business.
*  This is great.
*  Don't do anything else.
*  I love, I love what we're doing.
*  Let's not panic.
*  And now they've done another thing.
*  And now if that team doesn't look like last year's team and it's a little choppy,
*  people are like, why the fuck did they do all this?
*  I like a lot of pressure.
*  Yeah.
*  A lot of pressure, especially on Carl.
*  It's a lot of unfair pressure.
*  I mean, it is, it's called for what it is.
*  And I should, it's hard to say unfair when he's getting paid that much, but
*  they're expected to be really good.
*  When is it unfair?
*  How much, how many million dollars per year?
*  You said 60.
*  He's a 49.5 this year.
*  So it might be mildly fair.
*  Fair point.
*  But a lot of pressure though.
*  All right.
*  We're talking about Carl Anthony towns.
*  This is such a fascinating career moment for him.
*  And this happens sometimes in the NBA, right?
*  Like bridges gets traded from the nets to the next.
*  I don't really have any questions about bridges.
*  I know what kind of player he is.
*  I think he's a winning player.
*  We've seen him succeed on a finals team.
*  We've seen him at least try to hold the Ford on a bad team,
*  but he's probably more meant to be on as a third best guy on a finals team
*  or a team like this current next team.
*  I don't have any more questions about him.
*  Towns have had questions his entire career and that Minnesota team hit a
*  point during the playoffs where it was like, shit, they figured this out.
*  They have this crazy size defense on the wings.
*  I remember doing a podcast about this team has a chance to be the best
*  defensive team in 20 years.
*  Now all of a sudden they've blown it up and towns comes in as this guy who
*  just is going to be this 20 years from now.
*  Carl Anthony towns was a problem social media guy,
*  but maybe he could also still be really good and maybe he could be
*  the second best player in a title team.
*  We saw this happen with Andrew Wiggins.
*  Andrew Wiggins was the second best player on the Golden State Warriors who won the title,
*  which gives me hope for towns.
*  But I wouldn't bet on it.
*  Wiggins adjusted his game.
*  Especially when you look at the growth in his game, the arcs,
*  we went from being like a guy who just didn't really know how to play basketball,
*  scored the ball in Minnesota, really like,
*  wasteless points, you know, those type of 20 shots a game.
*  Yeah, to where he's playing efficient basketball is like the third, fourth option.
*  Some games, some games, the second option, some games, not
*  defensive.
*  Rebounding.
*  What he did to Luca, I mean, like those series after series after series,
*  even when Jalen and Tatum, the way he was guarding those guys,
*  that's why we've been kind of harsh on him the past year or two.
*  We're like, what happened, man?
*  Like, it looked like you figured it out.
*  Like, what's different now?
*  You know, like just be that guy.
*  But yeah, I really hope Carl Kim put something together,
*  but I feel like people have been so hard on him.
*  I get it.
*  I know he gets paid a lot.
*  I know this.
*  People attack him personality, the whole nine yards.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I just want the guy to go somewhere.
*  And it looked like you said you nailed it right on the head at one point, man.
*  Last year in the playoffs, we were watching them like,
*  I don't know if anybody's gonna beat this team.
*  I was like, they might be able to beat Boston.
*  Like this, they look incredible.
*  But they beat Denver.
*  I was like, this team looks insane right now.
*  They're all blocking shots and rebound and running the floor.
*  They're all long and athletic.
*  The way they're guarding Jamal Murray.
*  I'm like, bro, this team is, they are good.
*  Like, good God.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And then they just had that weird series versus Dallas.
*  And certain things got exposed, especially in the pick and roll.
*  You know, Luca picked that team apart, man.
*  And I think that was like the final straw for this experiment.
*  We were like, yo, we did have a great year.
*  We got to see if we can make something shake here between the two bigs.
*  One of them got to go.
*  And Gobert doesn't have the kind of trade value to get.
*  You're not gonna get the return.
*  You're not gonna get the return.
*  Exactly.
*  So I think Carl was the guy.
*  And he always been that.
*  You know, he's been dealing with that.
*  You know, that this is just interesting right now.
*  With Julius Randall.
*  Can we talk about the business?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I had one last thing on Townes.
*  This is a legacy of the Knicks that predates when you were alive.
*  And even before your dad got into the league.
*  Like, we're going back to the 70s with Spencer Heywood and Bob McAdoo.
*  And, you know, through Stefan Marbury, Larry Johnson.
*  The legacy of this franchise and one of the reasons they haven't won a title since 1973
*  is over and over again, they get seduced by these expensive superstars.
*  Where it's like, well, maybe this will be the city and the team for him.
*  And Townes is kind of like that.
*  Like this is a 1976 Knicks move where you talk yourself into the glass half full version
*  of a guy that if it doesn't work out, you're fucked.
*  Right.
*  And I, and I understood why they make that made the trade.
*  I see it.
*  But they could also be fucked if this doesn't work out.
*  Because there's no second home for him.
*  If it, if this bombs in New York City and now you're talking about, look at Zach Levine right now.
*  Like they look at Brandon Ingham right now with one year left on his deal.
*  They can't find a suitor for him.
*  It's become harder and harder to trade these expensive guys.
*  When there's a fire sale sign on them.
*  So this kind of has to work out and the history of the Knicks is not great with this.
*  Maybe they'll be able to change it.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what I mean?
*  No, 100%.
*  Sometimes the history in the skeletons becomes part of the DNA.
*  It's weird.
*  It's an energy thing.
*  That's the only thing I can come up with.
*  You felt it in the Quippers.
*  The fucking energy and DNA around the Quippers overcame the Quippers.
*  It just felt like no matter how good we were, something was going to hold us back.
*  Whatever that is.
*  I don't know.
*  Something wasn't going to work out.
*  Someone's going to get into it.
*  I totally understand what you're saying.
*  This is definitely, if we're talking about the, it's like the frustrating part of being a Knicks fan.
*  I mean this is what Stephen A and all these guys yell about every time they're on.
*  I mean like, yeah, as good as they get.
*  It's like even like you just said a couple minutes ago, they got Mikel and everyone's like,
*  okay, we're good.
*  We're good now.
*  What a fun team.
*  I love it.
*  This is we can work with this.
*  We'll see how Julius and OG, if it gets weird, then we can address it then.
*  But like let's throw these guys out there and let's figure it out.
*  And then like they make this train.
*  It's like, here we go again.
*  Is this going to work?
*  Because now we're here.
*  Steven Chinzo was a big part of this team.
*  He's gone.
*  I mean Julius again was a guy even you can say whatever you want.
*  He's put in 25 a night.
*  So it's just like this is a big risk.
*  Carl, like we said, is a personality, is it going to work with him and Tibbs first and
*  foremost, let alone the environment of playing in the Knicks?
*  Well, now he's got Steven A.
*  He's got W fan.
*  You know, he's got a way bigger spotlight with the next thing.
*  And then if it doesn't go well, who are they going to blame?
*  I guarantee he'll be the number one person who gets blamed.
*  It's the only person.
*  Yeah, they're not going to blame the Villanova guy.
*  Yeah, they're not going to be any of those guys.
*  The most popular athlete in the city.
*  They love they're going to love Bridges, Nanded Obi.
*  After the 113 million dollar give back, you know, he's going to get a statue out there.
*  They want to change Brunson going to get a statue.
*  Yeah, well, I just hope they don't do forensic accounting of Brunson's.
*  Brunson's is checking count that the 100 if it was really 113 billion, but it can't be that much
*  because he can get out of there after two years and maybe upgraded after that.
*  Yeah, there's some stuff after two years.
*  All right.
*  Minnesota.
*  Better.
*  Worse or different.
*  If it's different, one of those three.
*  I'm going with different too.
*  Yeah, they're different.
*  I don't know if they're better or worse yet.
*  Definitely different.
*  I can't say they're worse because like Julius is no scrub, man.
*  Julius is a really good player.
*  And then you add Devin Shinzo to the fact that they got another two way player
*  to an already really good defensive team.
*  Now you got the Akils, you got Nas, you got Jaden McDaniels,
*  you got Ann who can really defend, you got Rudy Gobert.
*  We know what he does.
*  Now you throw like a Devin Shinzo on there like good God.
*  Every single guy on the floor can slide their feet.
*  They're going to have lineups where they are able to switch one through five.
*  You know what I mean?
*  That's a very dangerous weapon to have in today's NBA.
*  Every down screen switch kills a whole play.
*  So they have that ability to do that.
*  And that's part of the reason why the Nuggets struggled with them.
*  Jokic just had Nas thrown at him.
*  Then he had Rudy thrown at him.
*  Then he had Carl thrown at him.
*  Just multiple bodies are thrown at him.
*  Obviously, Carl's not there, but they still have Nas.
*  And I think that's a big reason.
*  But Carl being one of the three I think really helped them.
*  Because it was all three of those guys and it was the totality of it.
*  Now they don't have the same kind of totality.
*  But they bet on that though.
*  They bet on that.
*  I think the stock on Nas is so high.
*  They're like, you know what?
*  I think we're good.
*  Letting go of Carl.
*  This guy's just as good in some ways.
*  Nas is fucking talented.
*  They're like, let's let the young guy get some minutes more.
*  We still got Julius in there.
*  But if it doesn't work, he has an expiring contract anyway.
*  And we got this dude right here.
*  Or you can trade him in February because at the time of the deal,
*  you can flip Randall if it doesn't work out.
*  I'm glad you mentioned the Nas thing because there were a lot of moments last season.
*  When Nas was out there instead of Towns.
*  Where it's like, oh, I'm sure they're worse.
*  I might actually like this version of the team a little bit more.
*  And I wonder, Tim Connelly runs that team who's a super smart guy, very well respected.
*  And I wonder if every time that happened, he was like, hmm, I'm going to file that one away.
*  Because they locked Nas up.
*  Nas is on a good deal.
*  And you think like short term, they're going to get hit this year.
*  But they did save a bunch of money on the luxury tax.
*  I think they saved like $40 million luxury tax.
*  But then next year, Randall comes off.
*  So that's 30 million.
*  That's just off.
*  You replace that with like a nine, $10 million guy and try to patch together the Towns minutes
*  with Nas and somebody else with DDB.
*  And it's still way less than you're paying Towns.
*  And I'm sure that's how they saw it.
*  And they have more flexibility.
*  The Towns thing was just like the Grim Reaper.
*  You go on spot track and you just see it with all their salaries.
*  Especially if like they're clearly building around Edwards and that's going to be the guy.
*  And you can't also have a $60 million teammate for him.
*  That's not you can if it's Jalen Brown.
*  You can if it's that.
*  It's so funny that you said that.
*  It's like you could feel it.
*  Like even two, three years ago before I took that job last year, I was there.
*  Yeah.
*  And, you know, it's not that Carl was had any animosity towards it.
*  He didn't do anything malicious, anything like that.
*  You could feel it just in some of like the behavioral, like just energy that he was like
*  losing can I want to say losing control.
*  But yeah, like it was he was losing their alpha dog status.
*  Yeah.
*  The big brand has been his, you know what I mean?
*  And now this guy comes in and he's talking and he's and everyone's so swayed by him, too.
*  It's the way it moves like it walks in the locker room and he said it's immediately his.
*  Yeah.
*  Everyone is just like you can see he was just like, what the fuck?
*  It was just it just happened.
*  And I think they they're ready now, especially with the Nas play.
*  I think they're like, yo, I think we can do this.
*  We had even Shinzo.
*  I just don't like and I love Julie's.
*  I love Julie's on a lot of teams in the league.
*  Just not this one, man.
*  You got a guy who's like he needs like five, six seconds.
*  He's not a quick decision guy.
*  He's not a pick and pop guy.
*  It was already clouded and crowded with with with Go Bear in him.
*  Julie is out there in the middle of the floor just hovering around.
*  And then you got Go Bear who doesn't really the spacing is going to be awkward.
*  Yeah.
*  So you think the starting five would be Aunt Conley, McDaniels, Randall and Go Bear?
*  Has to be.
*  Who else?
*  And then the bench is Nas, Dante, Dillingham, Alexander Walker.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Now.
*  So it'll be one of these situations where the starter it'll be like what happened with
*  the Olympic team.
*  The starters come out.
*  They're minus six.
*  The bench comes in.
*  The bench gets the lead back.
*  You're like, oh, they should probably mix this up.
*  And they just they won't.
*  But really, they're crunch time five.
*  Randall's not going to be out there.
*  I don't think that's the Nas will be in the Randall spot.
*  And that's going to be a big ego blow.
*  That's going to be a prep for sure.
*  Again, we're talking about a 25 and nine player.
*  This is a big time player.
*  He's an all star.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what I mean?
*  So this is a guy like this guy is a mid level contract.
*  Why is this guy finishing the game over me?
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like, what's going on here?
*  Well, you mentioned the spacing with him and Go Bear, which is going to be weird.
*  There's also I love Aunt.
*  And as we've discussed in the past, I mean, he's he's my vote to be the next big American
*  super duper star.
*  It's a little ball stopper.
*  Just a little.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  That's what again, there's guys like Kobe Gilbert Arenas, right?
*  Whoever you go score, they're a little bit of a ball hog.
*  Well, listen, you're a scorer.
*  Go do that.
*  Do what you're supposed to do.
*  But he is a ball stopper and he's great.
*  We all love it.
*  Like you said, but that is kind of what he is.
*  That's what Julius Randall is.
*  They're both the same.
*  Julius is not a quick decision guy.
*  You go to him in the post.
*  You got to wait five seconds for him to score.
*  Like it is a process.
*  It takes a lot of dribbles.
*  It's a lot of work.
*  Picking and popping is not really his game.
*  He wants to catch pump fake, raise you.
*  He does the whole thing.
*  Him with Ant.
*  It's a strange dynamic with Rudy on the floor, too.
*  And they have to start that lineup.
*  I hate to say half, but like.
*  Well, there's another version of it where Go Bears not out there
*  and they're playing Nas, Randall, McDaniels, Conley, or it's
*  they're playing Dante in the McDaniel spot because McDaniels is
*  trick or treat.
*  And there's games when he doesn't have it.
*  They didn't have a swing to bring in for him last year if he didn't have it.
*  Right.
*  That's one of the reasons they lost the Dallas series.
*  Now with Dante, he can come in.
*  It's a good point.
*  He gives them he's not a point guard, obviously, but he gives them a little bit
*  of Conley insurance who's old and if Dillingham's not ready, you can kind of be like, fuck it.
*  Let's just put out Dante and Ant together.
*  And that's our back court.
*  That's exactly what they'll do.
*  That's exactly what they'll do.
*  That's exactly what he could bring the ball up.
*  He's not a point guard.
*  What's today's NBA point guard, man?
*  You know what I mean?
*  Yeah, they could definitely do that.
*  I like their flexibility.
*  There's a world where Randall maybe figures out how to make quicker decisions, but I mean,
*  he's still in his twenties.
*  The other thing is if he's unhappy from what we've seen from Edwards and you played with him,
*  when these guys are larger than life, I think he'll have a way of sucking Randall into buying
*  into the program because that could have happened to Towns, right?
*  Towns could have checked out or gone sideways.
*  And I thought it was so fascinating watching how Edwards dealt with him.
*  Psychologically and how inclusive he was of him and how he'd bring press conference.
*  He would tease him on the podium.
*  He was just so clearly trying to boost him up and Bundy and he brown him the whole time.
*  And I do think he'll do that with Randall.
*  I don't know if it'll work, but I bet he tries to do it that way.
*  I would imagine just, you know, obviously Julius is a high level player, so you got to have a high
*  level mind to some, you know, to some level, right?
*  And I play with Julius.
*  He's a smart player.
*  There's a, there's a, just a human awareness here, right?
*  The Brunson thing, we all agree kind of came out of nowhere and it was like a back and forth,
*  you know, they didn't like Batman, Robin.
*  And it wasn't the term he wanted there.
*  This is a very clear situation he's walking into.
*  There's no way in hell Julius Randall walks in the Tim Wolf's locker room and is like,
*  I'm the best player here.
*  Right.
*  You know what I mean?
*  So I think he knows even here, like, plus we're just talking from the money standpoint,
*  he's probably like, do I need another place to go to where I'm unhappy and not work?
*  I need to come into this situation, put my ego aside, fit in, fix some things,
*  tweak some things, work on maybe how quick I go, what shots I'm going to be, what spots
*  they need me on the floor.
*  What does Tim, what does, what does Finchie need me to be?
*  What does Tim Conley expect out of me?
*  What are you all bringing me here for?
*  And try to tap into that instead of trying to go have a contract here.
*  This is not set up for you to do that.
*  This is not the Knicks.
*  You're not going to get, just get the ball in the post every time they're going to sit
*  there and watch you do your five dribble.
*  It's not how that's going to work here, bro.
*  They got another guy that does that and he's better than you.
*  So, you know, well, can I throw another scenario too, off this scenario is a player
*  option next year.
*  Yeah.
*  So everyone's like, well, he's going to be a free agent.
*  He's playing for new contract.
*  You were saying that about the Angela Russell last year.
*  Right.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Well, he's going to be, guess what?
*  Guess who exercised his player option?
*  The Angela Russell.
*  That 31 million for 2026 might be Randall's best option.
*  And maybe, you know, maybe this is a two year thing, not a one year thing.
*  I think that would really screw them up from a tax salary cap standpoint.
*  But regardless, RIP, the 2004 Detroit Pistons reincarnated in Minnesota.
*  I think that I don't see a scenario where they're as good defensively as they look
*  for a couple of stretches there.
*  There's another piece of this though, is, you know, Minnesota were built to beat Denver.
*  Tim Connelly came in, he saw Denver.
*  He had to build this super team to beat them and then they beat them.
*  This is kind of a loss for Denver.
*  Minnesota's like, we actually don't need to beat Denver anymore.
*  We're more worried about OKC and Dallas and maybe Memphis and Denver's worse.
*  And maybe we don't have to have a team that's just specifically built to beat
*  Yoke-age because they're not the same team anymore.
*  And the team they have now is a little better equipped to deal with like an OKC type of
*  team and Dallas, a team that they got their asses kicked.
*  So in a weird way, I feel like this was a loss for Denver.
*  Which is a strange thing to say, but I just don't think they're as invincible.
*  And I think this trade proves it.
*  Minnesota's like, yeah, fuck it.
*  We don't need the Yoke-age stoppers anymore.
*  We're fine.
*  100 percent.
*  Especially with the talent that, like you said, Denver's lost, KCP, Denver's lost, even
*  guys like Jeff Green, Bruce Brown.
*  A lot of these key assets that they've had, they've kind of let just trickle away.
*  Jabammer is a good player they've lost.
*  I'm kidding.
*  He's coming back.
*  I'm buying it.
*  Yeah, come on.
*  Let's reinvest in some Murray stock.
*  The Olympics was you could see he just kind of showed that he literally just showed up.
*  But he hadn't touched the ball like since they got out.
*  It was not the Jamal that I know.
*  But I still got some faith in him.
*  Obviously, he had a good season last year.
*  Weird ending.
*  Playoffs is weird, but he's a big time player.
*  But they're not as like you said, they're not as invincible as they were.
*  They're OKC is the OKC is now the bar.
*  Oh, sure.
*  Especially with the crucial.
*  Oh, sure.
*  Especially with the Caruso adding and then the other guy they got.
*  Hardenstein.
*  Hardenstein.
*  I mean, that's huge, bro.
*  And then Jalen Williams, year three, Chet, year three, Jalen Williams, year four.
*  I can't remember.
*  Those guys are still early.
*  All right.
*  Next question.
*  Why didn't we realize this whole summer that a town's trade was inevitable?
*  I'm kind of mad at myself.
*  And I think I've mentioned it on past podcasts that I felt like we're heading to this point.
*  I think we're heading to it before the season.
*  But all the ownership bullshit they had, all the tax shit that was coming, the fact that
*  they had Nas on a good contract.
*  I just feel like.
*  I feel like we should have seen this one.
*  The ownership stuff and complete this array.
*  I just I wish I felt like he was always headed to the next in my head because Leon was his agent.
*  They have the Kentucky thing.
*  But yet I was completely blindsided last night.
*  I just thought that this would happen in January if the Minnesota season was a little unhappy.
*  And the next seat, we're falling apart without a center.
*  But now I'm like, oh, shit, of course they traded towns.
*  Do you feel that way at all?
*  Well, you see a successful run conference finals run.
*  The immediate thought, I think, is they're running it back.
*  You know, like this is they're this close.
*  There's a weird series versus Dallas could even been a matchup thing.
*  Who knows if they would have matched up with someone differently next year.
*  Like they could be in the finals.
*  They probably would have played Boston way better than Dallas did.
*  You know, I mean, sometimes it's just matching.
*  That's right.
*  So to that point, you're just like, why wouldn't they run it back?
*  So that's that was surprising.
*  When I saw Carlton City Towns, I did I felt kind of on both sides of the fence
*  because I felt the other way to him.
*  Like they also have been putting his name out.
*  His name has been in talks for a minute since this since the go bare thing came about.
*  His value has gone down so much that everyone knew the guy to be traded was Carl.
*  And everyone's like, it's just a matter of time what is going to happen.
*  And then we see the success and we're like, oh, well, they're not getting rid of them.
*  They might ride this out.
*  But then you add the contract stuff into it.
*  You had all the other points.
*  Nas read all these different things you add to it.
*  We shouldn't be surprised, really.
*  It was inevitable that he was going to get moved.
*  Friday Friday night as I'm having cocktails, I was a little surprised.
*  Can you can you walk me through your best case scenario for towns in New York
*  as somebody who's spent time with them and played with them?
*  Let's say this goes awesome.
*  This is like cloud in the sky.
*  Holy shit.
*  Almost like when the when the Celtics traded for Drew and poor Zingas
*  and then just everything worked out.
*  What's the town's version of that in New York?
*  Best case scenario is he gives himself to the tips.
*  And I mean that in a sense where he buys in fully on what tips needs him to do defensively.
*  I'm not really worried about Carl offensively.
*  He just knows how to put the ball in the basket, whether it's him shooting over guys,
*  and scoring in the post.
*  Carl is going to score the ball.
*  He's going to average 20 plus points per game,
*  because that's what he's done every single year he's been in the NBA.
*  And he's going to do that next year, no matter what team he plays on.
*  He's too good of a shooter and too much too skilled of a player.
*  It's the other stuff that we talked about.
*  And these are the quotes.
*  The quotes after a game, the quotes after the game, you know, the little things,
*  all this other stuff with New York media and with Tibbado as your coach,
*  can he buy in and give himself to fit into that program?
*  You got like Josh Hart and you got Mikhail Bridges and you got Brunson, all these Villanova.
*  There are certain type of guy that Tibbado works well with and they have him over there.
*  Carl's not those things.
*  Great guy, but he's just different.
*  That is the concern.
*  Best case scenario is he gives himself to Tibbs.
*  He's locked in.
*  He's going to have his little quotes and funny moments,
*  but it's all within realm of positivity and nothing that's a distraction.
*  He's shooting the ball at a high clip,
*  because that's what they're bringing him there for.
*  He's stretching the floor, he's shooting the ball high.
*  So he starts out like 50% from three in the first six weeks of the season.
*  You remember like the first two weeks, Grant Williams was the Mavs.
*  I couldn't miss and everybody was like, this is the best.
*  This is perfect.
*  Yeah, that is what they need from Carl.
*  Too soon for the Grant Williams fabrics.
*  That age, that age very poorly.
*  Oh, too soon?
*  Too soon.
*  Hashtag too soon.
*  My bad.
*  Yeah, that's the best case scenario.
*  I think he works well with Tibbs first and foremost.
*  Basketball wants to take care of himself.
*  So you talk about sacrifice.
*  This is KG and Ray going to the Celtics with Pierce and Doctel and Ray.
*  Like you didn't have five less shots this year.
*  Sorry.
*  And also, let's be honest, man.
*  Like is he the best player or second best player?
*  I know you say Brunson is, but like I'm telling you, if you're Carl Townsend,
*  you're like, I'm an eight time All-Star, man.
*  This guy's a one time, two time All-Star.
*  Like it's easy to do with Ant.
*  Ant's like this exploding, you can't deny it.
*  You know, he's like a top five, top ten player in the NBA talent.
*  This is the guy, right?
*  Brunson has had a career year last year, but Carl might be thinking I'm the guy here.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know what's going through his mind.
*  So this is your worst case scenario.
*  I mean, the thing is it's Brunson City.
*  Brunson's dad is on the coaching staff.
*  Brunson has these incredible relationships and I'm sure through the agents,
*  Brunson and Townsend have probably known each other for a while.
*  I almost want to bring conspiracy billing, but it's not, we're still workshopping it.
*  But Brunson giving up the money and then the Townsend trade happening a month and a half later.
*  And all the same agents.
*  I'm like, hmm, something.
*  There's a little scent to that one, but I conspiracy bill.
*  We're not bringing them in.
*  I'll just say this.
*  Townsend I find just impossibly frustrating as a basketball fan.
*  Really?
*  And yet I do like him.
*  Like I really do kind of weirdly root for him.
*  And he's become one of those athletes where you're like, just stay out of your own fucking way, man.
*  Yeah, bro.
*  You're so talented.
*  Just don't fuck this up.
*  He's just turning one of those guys.
*  Yep.
*  And that's what I'm saying is best case scenario.
*  Stay out your own way, Carl.
*  Do the little things.
*  Work on the defensive stuff.
*  He's going to do things that's going to drive tips and people crazy.
*  But if the other stuff over clouds at his performance on the offensive end,
*  if he goes vertical at the rim again, they need him to be a center.
*  Now, the past couple of years, you haven't had to do the center work.
*  Rudy's done all that.
*  You get to float around, shoot your threes offense.
*  That is completely different from what you're about to get yourself into.
*  Mitchell Robinson is hurt.
*  God knows when they never know with him.
*  You are the center.
*  They need you to rebound and block shots and contest at the rim and be vertical without
*  staying and without getting in foul trouble.
*  These are some big, big tasks at hand.
*  They have no shot blocking.
*  They need you to do that.
*  And he's notorious for fouling.
*  These are things that mix well.
*  So it's like that is best case scenarios.
*  He's able to figure out that formula where he's able to stay on the floor and be productive
*  without getting in his own way.
*  Like you said, that's best case scenario.
*  I think he can do it, though.
*  I'm really hopeful.
*  He's such a talented person, talented player.
*  I just want to wish the best and be positive here, Bill.
*  I do too.
*  But as a Celtic fan, I'm like this as we might be better off with.
*  Yeah, you don't want it to work.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, it can work until they get to whatever round plays.
*  So here's summer.
*  You guys just don't do anything.
*  You don't even have to.
*  What the luxury of a Celtics fan right now?
*  No need to go to the market.
*  Just run the whole and somehow they're coming back pissed off.
*  Continuity with a chip on our shoulders somehow.
*  Somehow both your best players are pissed off.
*  I mean, it's best case scenario for you.
*  Well, you know, and Missoula has been apparently in a good way a maniac about
*  no mention in the championship.
*  I don't want to see hats.
*  I don't want to see t-shirts.
*  We're not going to do like the yeah, yeah, we won.
*  Like we're moving forward.
*  That season happened.
*  It's over, which I think is how you have to do it.
*  Like let's go.
*  Fuck it.
*  Go for it.
*  Yeah, he's he's you know, does he wants to go back to back and the team's pissed off
*  and they're in a pretty good spot.
*  Here's my last question.
*  So the Knicks who we all liked, who we barely had all together and it was like,
*  this is really fun.
*  I'm really enjoying this.
*  And now that gets blown up.
*  Philly's changed.
*  You know, the Lakers seem to change every couple of years.
*  They don't really matter anymore.
*  The Warriors are different.
*  Minnesota was in the conference finals.
*  They just changed that Denver couldn't keep their team together.
*  It's just teams are just different every year.
*  Now the NBA has become 2K, which is not a new point.
*  Yep.
*  Do we like this?
*  Do we like the fact that just like you mentioned how, oh my God, Boston didn't do anything.
*  It's like, why do we have to do anything?
*  Why does it have to be a situation where, you know, it's it's just the season ends and
*  you press the 2K reset button and oh, I have new rosters this year.
*  How did we end up with a league like this?
*  Man, that's a great question, man.
*  Good God.
*  Where do I start?
*  I don't know how much time we have.
*  Is it the fact that the contracts aren't that long anymore or just the whole NBA is a whole
*  shifted?
*  I talked about this briefly on my pod.
*  Yeah.
*  Where, you know, the type of players that are playing in the NBA, I talked about the concern
*  I have for the longevity in terms of where the game will be at with the uprise of foreign
*  basketball.
*  I mean, how they're pushing guys out.
*  The type of contracts who's getting paid what it's just a funny league, man.
*  The AU culture that you start with the end with and the DNA of my team didn't win.
*  I'm now going to jump team.
*  I'm going and now and now with the NIL and the transfer portal, these kids don't have
*  to stay loyal to nobody.
*  But I went to practice.
*  Coach K used to make me cry because he was talking to me so crazy.
*  But you have to figure shit out, man.
*  You have to like break your spirit down.
*  You have to show like humility.
*  You have to get through stuff.
*  That's like part of like going to college and like playing for these teams.
*  If you go now and get yelled at the wrong way, they got a kid making two million dollars.
*  Man, he's going to look at you and be like, bye.
*  Like I don't even have to play here.
*  It's just it's different and it's way different than how they do it over there.
*  The style of play we're playing.
*  It's just I think it all connects.
*  And I think there's a copycat league.
*  A lot of people try to copy somebody who's doing something really good because they're
*  really good at it and think they can do the same thing.
*  And it ends up with bad products.
*  Yeah, it's like two way wings, shooting, stretch five.
*  It's like, bro.
*  So now they're pushing out other good players for like these type of guys.
*  But that doesn't mean these type of guys can play.
*  Everyone tried to do what Sam Presti does and like rebuild and restart.
*  Now we have just a bunch of bad teams who are still bad.
*  It's like not everybody's going to be able to do it.
*  Not everybody Sam Presti or Tim Conley.
*  So it's like we're in a weird state of the league right now.
*  I don't understand what I'm looking at.
*  I don't even know half the.
*  I'm watching.
*  I'm a journalist, man.
*  I study.
*  I'm a basketball junkie.
*  I'm playing pickup this summer with all these guys.
*  I'm just playing for fun.
*  I'm already in the media stuff.
*  Now that's where I'm headed.
*  I'm done playing for the most part.
*  And I'm just out here just hoping for fun.
*  And I'm playing against these guys.
*  I'm just like, good God.
*  I was like, this is who the hell is this dude?
*  You know, I mean, like it's just a different league, man.
*  I don't know who these.
*  So I don't know to answer that question.
*  I don't know how it happened.
*  I don't know when it happened.
*  I think it's been over the past 10, 12 years.
*  The league has drastically changed drastically.
*  Who's in running teams now?
*  What type of hires?
*  It's it's and I'm not saying I'm against it.
*  I'm just saying we are where we are.
*  And I think we've turned into the no patience.
*  Basketball Association.
*  We're the NPBA.
*  Oh, my God.
*  And so you look at a team like Miami that hasn't really done anything.
*  And you don't really have to do everything in August.
*  You don't have to do everything in September.
*  You don't have to do everything in October.
*  You can wait till you can watch a couple months and see it.
*  But really nobody does that.
*  And when they don't do it, you're like.
*  Loser of the summer, Miami.
*  They didn't do anything.
*  The Celtics, how are they, you know?
*  And so it's this mindset of like you had to have done something
*  for something to have happened.
*  But I just think the Knicks like going on the one hand, you could say,
*  well, they're putting together all these assets.
*  The Brunson thing worked out and they went gotten in the situation now
*  where they have I have towns as a top 35 player.
*  I have bridges in and OBEA is like top 55 players.
*  So those are three guys they didn't have two years ago.
*  So this worked.
*  The plan worked.
*  But I also really like watching that Knicks team last year.
*  And there was a way to there was ways to add to it without
*  going pot committed on this thing.
*  They're committed.
*  You know what I mean?
*  100 percent.
*  They went full send.
*  There was there.
*  I mean, they decided to go.
*  We all kind of liked what they were cooking and the spirit at which they played it in.
*  The Knicks were a team that if you weren't from there,
*  people just didn't want to even cheer for the Knicks.
*  That wasn't the case.
*  You had people like wanted this team to win.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Because they had like guys who played that basketball.
*  Besides, like all that stuff, they were good.
*  And you had enough assets there where you're like,
*  you know, they're only like, especially with Randall still being there.
*  You don't have to do this now.
*  Your team is going to be really good.
*  Let's put them out there and like find some stuff, see what works, see what we need.
*  And then like we got Randall here to move if we need to.
*  They just do it right now.
*  A week before training camp.
*  And now this is where they're at.
*  There's no backtracking out of this.
*  You know, I mean, especially with Carl is contract.
*  This is the this is the future here.
*  So you just know when the Lakers did that Westbrook trade and I was against it.
*  And I went on my pod and I was like, this is there's no going back now.
*  This doesn't work.
*  All of your doors are closed.
*  Right.
*  And what happened?
*  Didn't work.
*  All the doors are closed.
*  I don't think the town thing has a chance to be as bad as Westbrook on the Lakers.
*  But no, no, if it doesn't work that well, there's not a lot of options for this.
*  There's not a lot of next moves.
*  It helps when you can shoot at the end of the day.
*  The one thing we know we're going to get out of Carl's that dude is going to be out
*  there firing threes and knocking them down.
*  He's just going to be doing it.
*  He's just too talented.
*  It's just going to happen.
*  It's the other stuff that we talked about that we got to hope.
*  We got to hope in this type of magnifying glass, which he's going to be under now,
*  which he's not used to.
*  And just think every time we have done it, we've found stuff and laugh.
*  Carl, you got to move differently now.
*  You can't just get to the podium and start saying this is what movies are made of.
*  Again, we find it funny.
*  We love it.
*  I love him.
*  He's a great dude.
*  But the New York people, they'll tear that shit up.
*  It's brutal there.
*  Talk to Julius.
*  Talk to Melo.
*  Talk to any of the top guys that have been there.
*  Why do they like Brunson?
*  He don't talk.
*  He goes out there.
*  He puts in work and he shuts up.
*  He don't say nothing.
*  The only time he talks on his pod.
*  Right.
*  Even then he doesn't say anything except for his podcast.
*  Yeah.
*  And even on the podcast, he's very.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Now everyone has one.
*  Even when he's on there, he's still very 50 50.
*  But you know what I mean?
*  Yeah.
*  Jalen's very Jalen.
*  So it's like that is, you know, it'll be.
*  The way we need we need to get Carl Anthony Towns on on your podcast.
*  I did.
*  I did one with him.
*  No, I'm saying like New Nick, New York Nick.
*  That would be that would be fantastic.
*  A rerun would be great because I'm sure now he has a whole different whole different perspective of stuff.
*  Well, I bet I bet he's upset and I bet I bet they're working on him really hard being like we,
*  we, you know, Leon and West and those guys, we really want you.
*  We really want you.
*  This can be great.
*  The Jalen sent him texts, but I'm sure like, you know, I really did think he embraced the
*  Minnesota thing and wanted to be there.
*  Absolutely.
*  He was there for nine years.
*  Assurances over and over again.
*  They weren't going to trade him.
*  So I'm sure he's a little wounded by it.
*  All right.
*  We hit everything on a Saturday on a Saturday to commitment.
*  Unbelievable.
*  But this is the thing we had a lot to say about this trade.
*  Austin Rivers.
*  Great to see you listen to his podcast off guard and you're doing a great job.
*  Good to see you.
*  Appreciate you as always.
*  You'll be easy.
*  Thanks.
