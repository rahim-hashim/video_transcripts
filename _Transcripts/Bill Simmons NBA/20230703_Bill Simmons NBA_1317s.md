# Favorite NBA Free Agency Moves So Far | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [July 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8)
*  I thought the Lakers were the second best team in the West and maybe the second best [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=0.0s)]
*  team in the whole league at the end of last season. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=5.0s)]
*  And I thought they got better. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=8.42s)]
*  And I was really impressed by what they did. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=9.86s)]
*  They kept Reeves on an awesome contract. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=12.56s)]
*  Nobody made a run at trying to bump them up, put them in a bad position. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=15.66s)]
*  They get him at four for 56. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=18.88s)]
*  They get Gabe Vincent from Miami, who's like out of a lab to be the perfect LeBron guard [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=21.16s)]
*  off the ball. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=26.2s)]
*  They got Rui back on a price that's a little high, but it's tradeable three for 51. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=28.44s)]
*  They got D-Lo back on, it just seems like a trade machine contract. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  It's two for 37. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=36.24s)]
*  First year is like 18. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=38.04s)]
*  They got Torian Prince, who I fucking love. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=39.8s)]
*  I've loved that guy for like five years. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=41.72s)]
*  They got him for one for four and a half million. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=44.08s)]
*  I'm not a Jackson Hayes fan, but they have a playoff eight right now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  AD, LeBron, Reeves, Vincent, Vanderbilt, Rui, D-Lo and Prince that I think is as good as [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=50.56s)]
*  anybody in the West except for Denver. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=57.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's a couple I don't like, but the Reeves deals a no-brainer. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=61.32s)]
*  They're really smart in using basically the full mid-level for Gabe and just playing the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=66.28s)]
*  game the right way. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=71.60000000000001s)]
*  The biannual for Torian Prince at four and a half is a no-brainer, keeping Vanderbilt [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=72.60000000000001s)]
*  around. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=76.04s)]
*  You like him? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=77.04s)]
*  Who? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=78.04s)]
*  Torian? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=79.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=80.04s)]
*  Look at the shooting numbers and he's long. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=81.04s)]
*  It gives them, I think one of their problems last year is they felt like, do we have enough [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=82.04s)]
*  wing defenders here that match up with guys? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=86.16s)]
*  And they really didn't. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=88.72s)]
*  And Russell's not a defensive player. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=90.12s)]
*  Schroeder, I think, works his ass off. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=92.32s)]
*  So I respect it, but I also don't think it's necessarily a strength for him. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=94.88s)]
*  He was a little too involved last year, even though I thought he was more of an asset to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=99.36s)]
*  liability. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=104.0s)]
*  The thing I love about Prince, it's very similar to Bruce Brown last year in the Nuggets. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=105.0s)]
*  I just think he's not going to be afraid in big games. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=109.56s)]
*  You can throw that dude out basically anywhere and he's fine. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=111.78s)]
*  I've been kind of waiting for him to be on the right team. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=115.28s)]
*  I was hoping it was going to be the Celtics. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=117.48s)]
*  I really like that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  I'm surprised he wasn't worth more in the market. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  You just want to be in LA. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=123.64s)]
*  The Vanderbilt monies, they had the bird rights on him. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=125.84s)]
*  They just did a really good job of combining the exceptions with the bird rights. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=129.52s)]
*  I think Rui at 17 million, and that's a full 51 for him, is high for a guy that- [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=133.44s)]
*  You think? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=139.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=140.56s)]
*  But it was the same thing that we talked about a week ago with D'Angelo Russell when [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=141.56s)]
*  we were arguing about the price. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=144.68s)]
*  You're right. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=146.44s)]
*  Well, it still ended up being a little bit lower than I thought it was going to be, but [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  it felt like they weren't going to lose the asset for something else. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=151.56s)]
*  Then they were going to have to pay Russell probably a little bit more knowing, hey, if [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=155.16s)]
*  our guy Rui does deal here, we already know what's going to happen. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=158.56s)]
*  Again, what does he care? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=161.8s)]
*  He's coming off a playoff run where it looked like he was unplayable and he still finds [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=163.32s)]
*  a way to make almost $40 million because of the shooting. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, he's a human trade ship. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=170.16s)]
*  It's almost like the- Well, Costco's not a good call. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=173.72s)]
*  It's like the general version of Kyrie where it's like you still have to pay D'Angelo [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=177.24s)]
*  Russell a certain amount of money. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=183.04s)]
*  I know we're going to talk about the Kyrie stuff a little bit later on, but it's similar. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=184.6s)]
*  Then it's like, yeah, but you still have to pay this kind of guy that much even though [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=188.16s)]
*  I know you're going to push back on that when we get to Dallas as part of this. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=192.0s)]
*  Yeah, the Lakers were terrific. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=194.92s)]
*  They have a bunch of different options, but this also allows them to have a couple pieces [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=196.36s)]
*  here or there because even though I'm not going to say you're wrong about them being [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=200.20000000000002s)]
*  the second best in the West, second best maybe in the overall league, I don't look at this [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=204.16s)]
*  group and then go, okay, well, that's your two seed in the West. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=209.16s)]
*  Well, the X factor will be the health of those two guys, which was the X factor anyway, but [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=212.12s)]
*  if they can time those guys from a health standpoint in March, April, May, June, I think [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=218.44s)]
*  they're going to be in really good shape and I think they're going to trade D'Lo for something. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=222.76s)]
*  It does. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=227.04s)]
*  I look at this and I, you know, LeBron year 21, this is going to be his best chance probably [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=228.04s)]
*  until he goes and ring chases with whoever after the season. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  But I just keep staring at Davis. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  Like I wrote down all the guys on the team and I had AD first because I think he's the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=242.28s)]
*  best player in the team. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=245.6s)]
*  LeBron is one of the great players of all time, but AD's in his prime. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=248.16s)]
*  This is an unbelievable team for him to be on, but he's going to have to play center, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=252.39999999999998s)]
*  which we've never, you know, he's always kind of resisted, pushed against it, but he did. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=256.36s)]
*  I mean, he played, he played it when they won. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=260.92s)]
*  He played it when they won, even though they had the big options years ago. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=263.92s)]
*  But you know, but to me, I'm just looking at it like, what kind of career do you want [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=267.56s)]
*  to have Anthony Davis? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=271.44s)]
*  And you and I, we've talked about him a million times. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=272.44s)]
*  This is set up for him to be like a potential MVP, to be a one seed, to be like the guy [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=275.56s)]
*  in Los Angeles. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=282.24s)]
*  He's got to have to embrace being the center and really the only guy in the conference [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=283.48s)]
*  that is going to be a problem for him is, is Jokic. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=288.04s)]
*  He's a problem for everybody. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=290.68s)]
*  But I just look at him like, like to me, he's a guy to watch for October now because you're [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  never going to be, he wanted to go to LA to be in the Lakers, to play with LeBron and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=297.48s)]
*  to be on a really good team and a winning franchise. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  He's never going to be a better situation than what we just laid out. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  They have everything, but they need him to play 35 minutes a game. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=306.8s)]
*  The rest of the West, like they're good and they killed it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=310.48s)]
*  Although I do think it's kind of funny that they'll have Kam Reddish to replace the Mo [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=317.96000000000004s)]
*  Bomba hope role. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=320.6s)]
*  I didn't even mention him as you noticed. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=324.12s)]
*  But it'll just be like, yeah, man, you know, this guy's crazy athlete and like he'll have [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=325.12s)]
*  a night running around one time. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=328.24s)]
*  It's kind of like the Bomba stuff. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=329.76s)]
*  Honestly, it just reminded me of that, but I'm, I'm not being fair. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=330.76s)]
*  So I'm going to stop. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=333.96000000000004s)]
*  It's a win. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=336.96000000000004s)]
*  I think that's the best off seasons a team could have considering the restrictions and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=338.44s)]
*  the amount of money they had in the two guys and knowing that there wasn't that big third [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=341.0s)]
*  fish out there for them. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=344.35999999999996s)]
*  But it's, I can't tell if it's like the beginning of what the next thing is because there's [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=346.32s)]
*  certainly like, if they ended up a five or six seed, I don't know that I'd be shocked [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=352.46s)]
*  either would you? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=356.03999999999996s)]
*  No, cause LeBron might play 42 games. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, 40 would be low. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=360.12s)]
*  And Davis might play 51. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=361.28s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=363.08s)]
*  The sons, I wasn't crazy about what they did until they landed Eric Gordon today. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=365.12s)]
*  And now I'm putting that in my favorite weekend outcome. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=370.08000000000004s)]
*  I still haven't seen with the exact prices, but that's a guy who can play crunch time [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=372.76000000000005s)]
*  for them. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=376.40000000000003s)]
*  They can play. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=377.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=378.40000000000003s)]
*  They can play Booker and Gordon and Durant and Aitin and Beal and be really hard to guard [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=379.40000000000003s)]
*  in crunch time. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=386.56s)]
*  It's two years, six and a half. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=387.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=388.56s)]
*  It's two years, six and a half million with a player option. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=389.56s)]
*  That's a joke. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=391.04s)]
*  That's such a good deal. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=392.04s)]
*  Why do you think he, do you think he just really want, I mean, I'm sure his whole career, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=393.52s)]
*  he's been dying to get back to where he got to in that one Houston season. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=398.28s)]
*  And he's been on a lot of shitty teams over the years and a lot of bad situations. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=402.28s)]
*  I've always liked that guy. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=405.4s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=407.52s)]
*  I just was really impressed by that one. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=409.24s)]
*  Watanabe I like too. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=412.44s)]
*  I love what, you don't like what Phoenix did? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=413.44s)]
*  Like I think they had 162 million right at the tax line with the rant, Beal, Booker. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=416.71999999999997s)]
*  Oh, I did like, that's why I put it in favorite weekend outcomes. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=422.35999999999996s)]
*  I liked it. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=424.84s)]
*  I mean, as creative as LA was with the tools at their dispersal, what Phoenix did here [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=425.84s)]
*  were like, Metu's actually okay at 25 and he's a veteran minimum at two and a half. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=431.76s)]
*  Bates Diop, if you look at his shooting splits last year was actually pretty incredible. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=437.52s)]
*  You know, I'm not telling he's going to be closing the playoff run here. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=442.88s)]
*  The Gordon number, Watanabe you already covered, keeping a Kogi around who actually shot it [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=445.64s)]
*  better last year than he ever had before. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=450.96000000000004s)]
*  Although he's always kind of a negative on the box score, plus minus offensively out there. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=453.0s)]
*  With those four guys and a couple options here, and I think Bogle will probably, you know, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=457.96000000000004s)]
*  I just felt like Monty was just searching and chasing. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=464.0s)]
*  And it was that part where like these aren't adjustments. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=466.56s)]
*  This is kind of desperation a little bit more. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=469.36s)]
*  And a full look, a full season with this, to be fair to Monty, where it was kind of at the last minute. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=472.28000000000003s)]
*  Hey, Durant's back now and all the other pieces are gone. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=476.40000000000003s)]
*  But is considering how tight it was for them and trying to figure out the rest of it, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=479.08s)]
*  I think Phoenix did is probably a good job as you could just having multiple options for guys that are actually [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=483.71999999999997s)]
*  these dudes have been in rotations before. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=488.52s)]
*  Right. Or other teams. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=491.32s)]
*  Both of us like me too. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=493.32s)]
*  Metu. I do too. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=494.96s)]
*  Yeah. Metu? Metu. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=497.0s)]
*  Yeah. Both of us like them. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=499.88s)]
*  Here's my concern with Phoenix and why I thought they did about as well as they could have done with the [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=502.36s)]
*  restrictions they had. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=508.32s)]
*  I still think defense matters and I still value when we get to May and especially June getting stops. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=510.2s)]
*  And the team they currently have right now, I just don't think is going to get stops. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=517.8s)]
*  So they're going to have to be incredible offensively. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=521.88s)]
*  But we learn every year in the playoffs, it's like the defense is what wins. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=523.96s)]
*  If you're actually trying to win the title, the defense is what wins the title. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=528.36s)]
*  You can have your lead guy, you can have your scoring, all that stuff. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=531.64s)]
*  But ultimately it comes down to can you get stops? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=534.88s)]
*  Denver in that Lakers series, which was way closer than, you know, I think people remember, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=537.88s)]
*  but they got stops down the stretch against that Lakers team. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=542.4399999999999s)]
*  That last play of the game went for the sweep. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=545.1199999999999s)]
*  LeBron going in the basket. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=547.56s)]
*  They got to stop. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=548.7199999999999s)]
*  They had Gordon that they could throw on different people. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=549.7199999999999s)]
*  And I just don't think they have anything remotely approaching that on the roster. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=552.0799999999999s)]
*  So I'm not saying you can't win a title that way. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=557.16s)]
*  I'm just saying you're bucking history year after year after year with the defense part of this whole thing. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=559.76s)]
*  And maybe they can address in February. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=567.2800000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=568.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they still have the Aitin chip, but I think the best case scenario was that Aitin [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=570.48s)]
*  looks a little bit like the guy from two years ago. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=575.72s)]
*  And I honestly can be worse. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=578.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, the Monty disconnect with Aitin just by having it not be Monty Williams is going to improve Aitin's [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=580.48s)]
*  vibe towards the team. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=587.52s)]
*  But look, I mean, to this point, he's been disappointing. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=588.96s)]
*  He's not the guy we all thought he could be. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=591.52s)]
*  It looked like maybe that was going to happen a couple of years ago. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=594.0s)]
*  But instead of just dumping him and doing the three guys for the one thing where usually you always lose that trade, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=596.4s)]
*  which I thought might be their only option. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=601.84s)]
*  Like when you go through every piece that they added here for these veteran minimums, like most of these guys have [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=603.76s)]
*  played in rotations and it's not just veteran minimum of like, oh, that guy's still in the league. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=608.68s)]
*  Well, Wadanabe clearly was a KD recommendation because he played with them. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=614.2s)]
*  And he had a nice little stretch when before the KD trade with him. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=618.56s)]
*  Nice little stretch. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=621.6s)]
*  He made everything. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=622.48s)]
*  He made everything for like two months. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=623.96s)]
*  I'm going to give you a little who says no to really bump your energy up right now. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=626.52s)]
*  Oh, why is it waning? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=630.92s)]
*  No, I just think you'll be excited about this. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=632.52s)]
*  And I don't know what the answer is for who says no. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=635.16s)]
*  Indiana calls Phoenix and says. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=638.0s)]
*  Miles Turner and McConnell for Aitin. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=642.56s)]
*  We need to know in two hours. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=645.4s)]
*  I think they should both say yes. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=650.4s)]
*  That's how I feel. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=652.36s)]
*  I really like that trade for both sides. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=653.84s)]
*  Indiana as we're about to cover is another favorite weekend outcome for me. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=655.8s)]
*  But I was thinking they have a lot of players. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=660.4399999999999s)]
*  They have Halliburton. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=662.24s)]
*  They have NMHard who I think we both really liked last year. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=663.7199999999999s)]
*  And they can kind of afford to trade McConnell. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=668.56s)]
*  And if I can turn Turner and McConnell into Aitin, I think Aitin is a better player than Turner. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=670.68s)]
*  I'm admittedly on the Aitin side of things and there's not a lot of us, but I still feel like he's a real asset. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=675.3199999999999s)]
*  And I respect what he's done and I think he's kind of underrated now as an asset. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=682.64s)]
*  And I like that trade for Phoenix because I'm getting two guys and Turner's given me a lot of what I was going to get from Aitin anyway. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=689.12s)]
*  And I get a real backup point guard and I'm probably just better. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=695.16s)]
*  Yeah, I just feel bad for Chris Paul. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=700.68s)]
*  I'd be like, oh, now you get McConnell. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=701.84s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=704.88s)]
*  Let's talk Pacers. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=706.36s)]
*  Wow. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=709.1999999999999s)]
*  Our guy Bruce Brown got the two for 45 with the player option year two. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=709.68s)]
*  They also resigned Halliburton to a huge extension and they have a nice little nucleus now with, they got Obie Toppin, which we mentioned in part one. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=714.76s)]
*  They could throw out Halliburton and Heald and Bruce Brown and Toppin and Miles Turner and Walker, their first round pick. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=729.2399999999999s)]
*  And Walker, their first round pick. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=735.36s)]
*  Matheran, Nemhart, McConnell, Jalen Smith. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=737.6s)]
*  It's a lot of talent for a team that we don't even know if they're going to make the playoffs or not. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=740.76s)]
*  But man, I just listed 10 guys who are like legitimate NBA players. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=744.5600000000001s)]
*  The deal for Bruce Brown's two years 45 million. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=748.36s)]
*  It's a team option on the second half. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=750.76s)]
*  So you're paying Bruce Brown essentially 22 million this year. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=752.5600000000001s)]
*  22 million for Bruce Brown as much as we all love him, but away from Jokic is too much money. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=755.84s)]
*  I think I agree, but we saw this over and over again. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=760.32s)]
*  The tax we usually used to joke was like a 25% tax for the teams to get guys to come to their city when it maybe wasn't the most desirable location. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=764.5200000000001s)]
*  It seemed like this year was like a 50% tax. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=774.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's fair. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=779.0s)]
*  It seemed higher. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=779.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=780.24s)]
*  You know what it reminds me of? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=780.48s)]
*  Van Vliet for three for 130 for Van Vliet. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=781.48s)]
*  Is he at three for 90? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=786.2800000000001s)]
*  Is he a three for 90 guy? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=787.56s)]
*  So they paid him an extra 40 million. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=789.52s)]
*  Right? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=793.0s)]
*  Should he make more than I like Fred Van Vliet, I get it. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=794.28s)]
*  But should he make more than $30 million a year? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=796.92s)]
*  I'm just asking the question. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=799.1999999999999s)]
*  It's a lot of money for Fred Van Vliet. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=801.0799999999999s)]
*  It's a ton, but you're right. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=804.4s)]
*  It speaks to the tax, the tax of, you know, sometimes it used to just be the free agent tax. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=805.4799999999999s)]
*  They're like, oh, I think this guy will get a hundred and like, I'll just make it 120. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=810.1199999999999s)]
*  But the, do you want to go to this team? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=813.3199999999999s)]
*  It's a 50% tax then. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=815.1199999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=816.12s)]
*  And especially when you knew that like the starting point for Bruce Brown was 12 million. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=816.64s)]
*  The fact that it's only one year, that's really all this commitment is. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=821.44s)]
*  Cause I just don't think as much as I like his game and all of that stuff, $20 million [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=825.72s)]
*  for that guy away from Jokic, he's going to be a different guy. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=829.64s)]
*  And it reminds me a lot of the Jabari Parker deal that he did with Chicago where [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=833.04s)]
*  Chicago had the cap space, but they didn't want to extend it out because they want to [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=836.52s)]
*  be able to reset it again. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=839.72s)]
*  And they go, look, this is how we'll do it. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=840.8s)]
*  We'll do one year. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=842.52s)]
*  And then I don't know if there was a lot of money in there, but I think it's going to [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=843.28s)]
*  be a good deal. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=846.0s)]
*  I think there was an option, but they never picked it up. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=846.68s)]
*  It was one year and 20 million for Jabari Parker. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=848.28s)]
*  And it was an absurd single annual salary just because the deal was so short. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=851.16s)]
*  So in this version, I still like Bruce Brown better than what I liked from Jabari back [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=856.36s)]
*  then, but that's what the deal reminded me of. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=860.52s)]
*  Would you like it if it was one for 15? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=862.96s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't even think about it. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=866.16s)]
*  I just think north of 20 for Bruce Brown's a lot of money. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=867.28s)]
*  And what are they going to spend it on? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=869.44s)]
*  They're Indiana. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=870.92s)]
*  What do they care? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=871.88s)]
*  They had to get them. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=874.08s)]
*  I'll ask you this. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=874.96s)]
*  Let me let me have you think about it this way. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=875.72s)]
*  Will you enjoy watching this team on League Pass? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=878.6800000000001s)]
*  Because of Bruce Brown? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=881.72s)]
*  You're good. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=882.8000000000001s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=883.2s)]
*  Have you ever turned on a game because of Bruce Brown? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=883.6s)]
*  I'm saying the 10 guys they put together, I kind of like the team. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=885.4000000000001s)]
*  Well, I love Matheran. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=888.8000000000001s)]
*  This would be a league pass team for me. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=889.88s)]
*  Haliburton's my guy. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=891.6800000000001s)]
*  Buddy healed in a contract year. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=893.4000000000001s)]
*  I can't wait to see if Toppin was one of those. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=896.0400000000001s)]
*  Like there's this, I have Knicks fans in my life who were like, Tibbs fucked up [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=898.9200000000001s)]
*  this Toppin thing, he's going to go to another team and he's going to be really [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=904.48s)]
*  good and they made this trade because as usual, Tibbs couldn't figure out somebody [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=907.84s)]
*  at all and he's going to come back to haunt us. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=912.5600000000001s)]
*  I have people in my life who are passionate and convinced that he's going to fuck them [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=914.8000000000001s)]
*  over when he goes through another team and everyone's going to feel stupid. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=921.16s)]
*  Toppin's best stuff I felt like was when he got to play the big in a small lineup. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=926.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=931.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=931.64s)]
*  So will they do that? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=931.96s)]
*  If they do that, then I think you're unlocking something that's kind of fun, but just [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=933.52s)]
*  straight his skills. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=937.24s)]
*  I don't think all of a sudden Knicks fans have to worry about all-star Oby Toppin. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=939.0s)]
*  I don't like losing an asset for literally nothing unless there's a plan down the road. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=945.04s)]
*  Like just trading Oby Toppin for two second round picks to me is fundamentally dumb [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=949.84s)]
*  unless you're doing it because it's leading to this. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=953.76s)]
*  So we'll see what the this is. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=957.3199999999999s)]
*  But I just don't like giving guys away. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=959.52s)]
*  But these moves don't all happen. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=961.52s)]
*  Even the Houston thing with KJ Martin, you're like, what? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=963.4s)]
*  And then it's like, OK, yeah, but you've been drafting all these other players. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=966.9599999999999s)]
*  You got to find a minutes and then you just spend all this money in free agency. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=970.4s)]
*  You don't get to always keep something for something. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=973.7199999999999s)]
*  You don't always get to do it. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=977.1999999999999s)]
*  And for the Knicks, the Josh Hart thing worked out really well because he played ball [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=978.36s)]
*  with them knowing that if he didn't opt out, that they could then figure out a way to [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=982.76s)]
*  get Di Vincenzo, who I really like for them. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=988.8s)]
*  His Villanova guy. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=991.4399999999999s)]
*  Right. I think that's been brought up. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=992.6800000000001s)]
*  KJ Martin, I had the Clippers on my favorite weekend outcomes list. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=997.4000000000001s)]
*  Only because I just like that they got KJ Martin basically for nothing, and they [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1002.8000000000001s)]
*  brought Westbrook back at a really cheap price and now they have two more assets on [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1006.5600000000001s)]
*  their team. And I think if you're them, you have to look at the big picture. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1010.0s)]
*  You have to fill in the 25 games Kawhi is not going to play and the 27 games Paul [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1014.6s)]
*  George isn't going to play and have enough people who can come in and actually [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1021.12s)]
*  create offense. So you're not the ninth seed again. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1025.16s)]
*  So for Westbrook at three point eight million, like there's never been a better. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1027.56s)]
*  He hasn't been in this good of a setup in a while since Oklahoma City. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1031.76s)]
*  Well, now Washington, that's not fair because he was, he at least made them [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1035.12s)]
*  competitive when he was like, he's like the guy at the comedy store who's like, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1037.96s)]
*  yeah, you're only going to get 10 minutes, but if Aziza and Sara doesn't show up, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1042.76s)]
*  can you do 40? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1046.8s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, I'm ready for either. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1048.88s)]
*  Can you actually do an hour? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1051.4399999999998s)]
*  Actually, we're going to need a headline tonight. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1052.7199999999998s)]
*  Bill Burr just canceled his, his limo from the plane. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1054.2399999999998s)]
*  You got it broke down. So you're going to have to actually do an hour 20. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1057.3999999999999s)]
*  Can you do that? Yeah, I can do it. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1060.1599999999999s)]
*  That's Westbrook. He's just like breaking case of emergency. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1062.32s)]
*  Hey, can you put up like 20, 12 and 15 tonight for us? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1065.32s)]
*  Because Kawhi and Paul George are playing. I'd love to. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1069.08s)]
*  Sounds great. Here 24 shots now. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1072.1999999999998s)]
*  You want them? I'd love them. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1075.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1076.84s)]
*  Because there's if everybody's healthy as much as sitting here being like, yeah, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1077.1599999999999s)]
*  KJ Martin, great move. Like he might not play. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1080.36s)]
*  Terrence man, barely played it. He's good. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1083.4799999999998s)]
*  They are playing like 20 minutes a game for them. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1085.8799999999999s)]
*  As everyone in my section went nuts. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1088.9199999999998s)]
*  Um, so the question is now is, can, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1091.36s)]
*  can they add Brogdon to this? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1095.08s)]
*  Can they turn like two, three pieces into Brogdon or James Harden, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1096.6399999999999s)]
*  something like that, or do they not need to do anything? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1100.9199999999998s)]
*  We will see. I think there's a real healthy appetite [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1104.24s)]
*  on the Clippers behind the scenes side of things to not bring back last year's [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1108.1999999999998s)]
*  team. So I'll be interested to see what happens. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1112.04s)]
*  I don't think they're like super psyched to have another Marcus Morris in a [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1115.7199999999998s)]
*  contract year, um, upset that Tai Lu doesn't understand that he should be [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1119.24s)]
*  playing 30 minutes a game and they just have too many veterans and too much [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1124.24s)]
*  depth and they just have to hash it out somehow. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1128.7199999999998s)]
*  And that's where we get to the Kawhi part. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1132.76s)]
*  Yeah. But I mean, what are their options? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1135.04s)]
*  They need to make a three for one. No, they mean to make it three for one. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1139.76s)]
*  And they need to really put the training wheels on the first two months of the [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1143.76s)]
*  season and decide, do we want to break this up now? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1147.8s)]
*  If it's not working or wait till after the year. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1151.72s)]
*  So are you saying take the training wheels off, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1155.04s)]
*  like go into it at the start of the season, like let's, let's go one more run. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1156.84s)]
*  Cause I, I didn't know if you meant moving on from either Paul George or Kawhi, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1160.88s)]
*  which is not what I think you're saying, but I, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1164.6000000000001s)]
*  they're not going to be able to trade Kawhi, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1166.0800000000002s)]
*  but they'll be able to trade Paul George. All right. I think this is a very, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1167.3600000000001s)]
*  very wait and see be ready for anything Clippers season ahead of us. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1171.6000000000001s)]
*  Their worst case scenario is another disappointing, whatever. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1177.68s)]
*  And they lose in round one and it's like, Hey, here's our new arena. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1180.88s)]
*  We've spent $6 billion on it. Does anyone want to come? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1184.16s)]
*  Kawhi might play tonight. Want to drive to Inglewood? [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1186.7600000000002s)]
*  You never know what you'll see. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1190.1200000000001s)]
*  70% chance Kawhi plays tonight. Come on down. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1191.08s)]
*  The nets came Johnson four for one Oh eight. I have them in the winners. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1197.96s)]
*  Then the last one I had was the, uh, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1201.04s)]
*  I just like where the wizards ended up where they turned Beal and Porzingis and [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1204.1200000000001s)]
*  Monte Morris into pool and Tias Jones and Shamett is tradable. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1208.44s)]
*  Patrick Baldwin, Gala who's tradable. They got a bunch of pick swaps. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1212.76s)]
*  They got enough money to spend for Kuzma. And more importantly, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1215.96s)]
*  now they're worse and they're a lottery team and they're positioned out for one [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1218.56s)]
*  more top five pick. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1222.92s)]
*  I would just rather have the team they have now than the team they had two [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1224.52s)]
*  months ago. So I'm going to put them in the winners column. Thoughts on that. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1227.16s)]
*  I'd add Sacramento. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1234.24s)]
*  Stability. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1237.44s)]
*  Yeah. No, cause you thought, Oh wait, this is being Harrison Barnes. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1238.88s)]
*  Cause they're bouncing. They're like, you know what? He's not great. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1242.68s)]
*  He's not perfect, but he's still pretty good. He's young enough. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1244.44s)]
*  It's on a good number. They extend out sub bonus. Um, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1247.68s)]
*  that was smart. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1251.28s)]
*  You know, the Tray Lyle's piece of it as well. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1252.1200000000001s)]
*  What about Vazenkov? Any, you have any Vazenkov thoughts? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1254.88s)]
*  No post draft. I, I stay away from the, I'll get into it a little bit later, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1257.8s)]
*  but I don't, I don't have much for you. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1261.64s)]
*  So you didn't go on YouTube and dive in on Sasha Vazenkov? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1263.2s)]
*  I don't like watching YouTube clips of guys. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1267.04s)]
*  I have Euro MVP. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1269.16s)]
*  No, because the YouTube stuff, I mean, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1270.92s)]
*  they'd have me looking like I was a second round pick in my twenties. You know, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1272.5600000000002s)]
*  you put a little Aerosmith underneath it, stuck in an elevator. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1275.48s)]
*  We should, we should tape like four months of your pickup, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1280.24s)]
*  pickup games and then do an NBA draft combine video of it. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1283.0400000000002s)]
*  This one guy was trying to get me to like talk up a dude that was never, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1288.0800000000002s)]
*  ever going to be drafted. He was like, you got it. You got it. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1291.3200000000002s)]
*  I was like, what do you think is going to happen? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1294.44s)]
*  I'm going to mention the guy's name on a podcast and the thunder are going to go, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1296.0s)]
*  Hmm. Was it Drew Hanlon? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1299.8000000000002s)]
*  No, I don't think we talk a ton lately. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETV48ZHsY8&t=1302.96s)]
