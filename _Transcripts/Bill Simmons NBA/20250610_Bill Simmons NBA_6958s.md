# Chuck Klosterman on the NBA Finals, ‘The Rehearsal’ and More | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc)
*  Alright, we're recording it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=0.0s)]
*  It is 922 Pacific time. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=27.06s)]
*  The man, the man, Chuck Closterman is here. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=30.82s)]
*  We're going to talk about a whole bunch of stuff. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=33.339999999999996s)]
*  Haven't talked to you in a while. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=35.58s)]
*  It felt like the right time. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=36.46s)]
*  A lot of stuff percolating in the air. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=37.86s)]
*  How do you, how do you gauge the right time? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=40.1s)]
*  What does the right time feel like to you? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=42.06s)]
*  Um, if I miss talking to you, if I feel like there's a lot of [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=43.86s)]
*  storylines for us to hit, um, usually things have to feel weird in some sort of [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=48.26s)]
*  way, I think sports feels a little weird right now, which I guess we could start [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=53.22s)]
*  that with the, with the, with the NBA, a sport that you and I both, uh, really [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=56.74s)]
*  love and we've been following forever. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=61.78s)]
*  And it has these ebbs and flows. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=63.78s)]
*  And sometimes you have a series like, okay, say Indiana with San Antonio, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=65.86s)]
*  Cleveland, or no seven San Antonio versus New Jersey, you know, three, there's [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=70.06s)]
*  these times when the matchup doesn't have big cities, doesn't have stars. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=74.18s)]
*  People are used to yet. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=78.74000000000001s)]
*  And everybody just freaks out and talks to, oh my God, like the ratings for game [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=79.82000000000001s)]
*  two, I think we're the lowest, um, since the bubble that were the lowest for us [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=83.78s)]
*  on a night since oh seven, uh, game one was bad too. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=88.06s)]
*  And then everybody overreacts. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=91.53999999999999s)]
*  A do you care about ratings at all? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=94.38s)]
*  And B where do you think about where we're heading with the NBA these next [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=96.38s)]
*  five years from a star standpoint? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=100.86s)]
*  Well, I mean, I guess I, I care is an interesting word. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=104.53999999999999s)]
*  I follow it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=107.41999999999999s)]
*  Certainly. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=108.06s)]
*  I'm always interested to see it because they always, they use that as a way to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=108.5s)]
*  sort of understand everything else. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=112.1s)]
*  It's sort of like the radio ratings. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=113.89999999999999s)]
*  And if they go up, well, then we have to look at what's happening in these [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=115.53999999999999s)]
*  games and decide that this is the future. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=117.82s)]
*  And if they go down, we think this is a failure. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=119.66s)]
*  It's not super surprising that the numbers are lower. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=121.69999999999999s)]
*  I would, I would think that there's, um, it, I mean, I, you do get the sense that [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=124.78s)]
*  all of these pro sports outside of football are sort of moving into more sort [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=130.82s)]
*  of kind of niche identities. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=135.94s)]
*  Like, I don't know if this is a terrible number considering the matchup, but [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=138.34s)]
*  it really is only for people who really like basketball. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=141.06s)]
*  So maybe the percentage that we're seeing is an accurate depiction of how [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=143.94s)]
*  interest, like what is the actual interest in professional basketball when played [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=147.5s)]
*  well by interesting teams who don't have a ton of guys who are famous. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=152.42000000000002s)]
*  Like maybe this is actual number. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=155.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=157.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=158.54s)]
*  I remember when I was writing my page two column in the mid 2000s, especially [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=158.78s)]
*  when it got pretty bleak there, there was like a Pistons Spurs, oh five finals. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=162.7s)]
*  Um, people were worried about like the, the art test, melee happened. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=167.46s)]
*  People were worried about like basketballs too. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=171.34s)]
*  There weren't enough points and didn't seem explosive enough. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=173.74s)]
*  And I remember it had this running joke about how I was one of the last 20 NBA [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=176.58s)]
*  fans, I was thinking with this finals that, um, it reminds me like, you're [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=180.1s)]
*  basically pushing with a casual offense, the people who only parachute in because [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=186.9s)]
*  oh, I know who LeBron is or like it's a big market, whatever. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=190.5s)]
*  And it reminds me of like when, uh, when Pearl Jam release, spin the black circle. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=194.82s)]
*  And it was a way to remind you of the mythology record, this series. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=199.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=204.78s)]
*  It pushes away the fans that didn't really care to begin with. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=205.18s)]
*  And it's like, just come here. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=209.18s)]
*  We want to appeal to the real fans. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=210.82s)]
*  Cause I think okay. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=212.3s)]
*  Save her. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=213.22s)]
*  Send Deanna as an awesome basketball matchup. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=213.57999999999998s)]
*  So do I. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=216.22s)]
*  I mean, the vitality thing is interesting because that was a [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=216.9s)]
*  conscious decision by the band. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=218.82s)]
*  It would be weird if the NBA was consciously like, right. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=220.5s)]
*  This is an unconscious decision. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=222.7s)]
*  Well, okay. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=224.78s)]
*  We've been doing this for what? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=225.17999999999998s)]
*  25 years now we've been having these talks. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=226.14s)]
*  What's the one thing that has never changed? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=228.38s)]
*  The NBA is always in a crisis. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=230.38s)]
*  It always is. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=232.82s)]
*  And there's never been a time it hasn't been. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=234.01999999999998s)]
*  I think 1984 to 1987 is the only period in my mind, in my memory, when it was [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=235.42s)]
*  like, everything is great right now. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=242.29999999999998s)]
*  There is no problem. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=243.62s)]
*  There is no percolating future. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=244.54s)]
*  We got to worry about like things are good. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=245.85999999999999s)]
*  This has always been the case. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=247.73999999999998s)]
*  I think I wrote that almost exact sentence in like a piece I did for ESPN [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=249.26s)]
*  in like 2005, the NBA more than any other league is always seeming to deal with [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=253.78s)]
*  this, but you know, what if people don't like this, like that problem just [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=258.62s)]
*  doesn't seem to go away. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=262.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=264.42s)]
*  I'm trying to think. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=264.65999999999997s)]
*  So you know, what were the healthiest periods in the history of the NBA? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=265.26s)]
*  I would say the middle 80s. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=270.18s)]
*  That's, but you know, perhaps late sixties, early seventies, maybe. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=271.65999999999997s)]
*  I think 91 and 93 Jordan's first three titles was a home run when you had the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=279.82000000000005s)]
*  Knicks, you had the Bulls. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=284.66s)]
*  Um, they were adding, they're of course, stupidly expanding and doing that stuff. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=286.46000000000004s)]
*  They had so much talent. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=290.34000000000003s)]
*  I think that was really good. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=291.78000000000003s)]
*  But if that was the case, why then a few years after that, they were like, we're [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=293.1s)]
*  going to move the three point line, man. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=296.06s)]
*  We got to do all these games are 88 to 76 in the playoffs. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=297.54s)]
*  That was the big thing in the nineties, right? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=302.94s)]
*  No one scores. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=304.54s)]
*  It's just, it's just bully ball. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=305.70000000000005s)]
*  Teams beating on each other. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=307.14000000000004s)]
*  It was like, there was Jordan and then like the Knicks and all these physical [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=308.26s)]
*  teams that he were like that for a while. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=311.42s)]
*  Um, it Jordan goes away for two years. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=313.62s)]
*  The ratings go down. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=316.58s)]
*  Everyone's like, ah, no one really liked basketball. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=317.53999999999996s)]
*  They really only liked Jordan. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=320.02s)]
*  Jordan comes back. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=321.42s)]
*  The ratings go up. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=322.14s)]
*  Ah, you see people don't really like basketball. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=323.21999999999997s)]
*  They only like him. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=325.26s)]
*  It's like, it didn't matter what went on. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=326.02s)]
*  It was always perceived as a problem. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=327.82s)]
*  And that seems to be unique to them because this is like, I, there's just never a time [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=329.9s)]
*  when people aren't talking about whatever. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=335.9s)]
*  Like now it's like team score too much, you know, that there's too much three point [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=337.62s)]
*  shooting and there is, although it is preferable, I think to games that are 81 to 70, I [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=341.46000000000004s)]
*  would say, you know, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=346.78000000000003s)]
*  So, so from a basketball standpoint, the last time the league felt really healthy was [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=348.70000000000005s)]
*  that oh, wait to 2012 stretch when the Lakers were in the finals for a three straight [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=354.46000000000004s)]
*  years, they played the Celtics twice, the Dirk Nowitzki 2011 season, and then the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=360.66s)]
*  decision, which was, I think the most important kind of fan interest event that [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=365.98s)]
*  probably happened in the 21st century. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=370.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=372.02s)]
*  But at the same time as all of this was happening, all these NBA teams were available. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=372.82s)]
*  The franchise values were going down. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=378.38s)]
*  We were headed toward this huge like lockout and this big crisis that they were having [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=380.26s)]
*  economically in the league felt like it was in peril. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=384.65999999999997s)]
*  Even though the basketball was good. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=387.5s)]
*  I remember a lot of talk about like, we knew there's a dress code now because we [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=389.38s)]
*  don't want me. That was a little prior to 2008. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=393.58000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, stuff like that is always going on. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=396.34000000000003s)]
*  Like, I suppose it's just like, you know, this is something else that we've kind of [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=398.66s)]
*  talked a lot about over the years. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=404.58000000000004s)]
*  It's like. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=405.78000000000003s)]
*  It is fascinating how the NBA sort of sustains this level of popularity, mostly [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=407.22s)]
*  through non basketball media events. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=415.02000000000004s)]
*  Like, it's it is very rare that the thing that most people are talking about is what's [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=418.98s)]
*  actually happening in these games. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=424.3s)]
*  And it's just it's always sort of been that way. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=425.82s)]
*  I'm not sure exactly why it is. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=427.86s)]
*  It might be the fact that because there's fewer players and we can really see them and [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=429.46000000000004s)]
*  we really do know their personalities, it pulls away the sense that what they're doing [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=434.22s)]
*  professionally is the most important thing. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=439.78000000000003s)]
*  And what's interesting about them matters just as much. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=441.74s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=443.70000000000005s)]
*  I just I feel like sometimes I feel that we do these podcasts and I'm like, did I literally [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=444.41999999999996s)]
*  say this 15 years ago? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=449.85999999999996s)]
*  I often feel that way. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=451.02s)]
*  Yeah, but what's weird about this one is that I would think ultimately having OKC in [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=453.21999999999997s)]
*  Indiana develop as signature teams. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=459.09999999999997s)]
*  Would be an awesome outcome for the NBA, and yet it's not perceived that way at all. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=462.73999999999995s)]
*  Well, you're perceiving it. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=468.29999999999995s)]
*  I mean, there's now this by the minority, though. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=470.73999999999995s)]
*  Well, you are in the in the country. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=473.22s)]
*  I wouldn't say you are in the media. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=476.78000000000003s)]
*  I feel like there is now kind of two channels of basketball discussion, and one has gotten [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=479.38s)]
*  the kind of the side you're on is we've got to watch every single game. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=484.22s)]
*  Like, I can't talk about this unless I get the NBA ticket and watch every single game. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=488.14s)]
*  And I need to have opinion, you know, a pretty informed opinion on, you know, you know, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=491.46000000000004s)]
*  the third best guy on the Pelicans or whatever. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=497.62s)]
*  And then there's the other side, which is sort of like, well, this is entertainment. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=499.62s)]
*  This is kind of an entertaining league, kind of like that with like what Derek Thompson [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=504.73999999999995s)]
*  would describe. It's like I love the NBA, but I watch no games. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=508.29999999999995s)]
*  You know, there's these two sort of silos of how this works now. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=512.02s)]
*  And what's interesting is both sides of this media equation talk to each other. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=515.42s)]
*  And the conversations don't go well because you have one guy on one side trying to [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=518.8199999999999s)]
*  describe like why the help side defense of, you know, Oklahoma City is so fascinating. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=523.9s)]
*  And the other guy is like, well, how do we feel about check though, as a person? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=528.82s)]
*  It's like, it just doesn't work. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=532.66s)]
*  You know, it's like, but it kind of keeps going that way. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=534.06s)]
*  This episode is presented by State Farm. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=538.06s)]
*  It's no secret that great teams need great teammates. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=540.34s)]
*  I've been saying this for years. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=543.1s)]
*  And when it comes to insurance, State Farm is there to help you find the right [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=544.42s)]

*  Talk to State Farm today. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=558.54s)]
*  State Farm with the assist coverage options are selected by the customer [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=560.5s)]
*  availability and the eligibility vary by state. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=564.3399999999999s)]
*  You know, I think people have struggled with OKC. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=567.8199999999999s)]
*  Brissol and I talked about this on Sunday because there's not really [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=570.3s)]
*  storylines yet for them. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=573.0999999999999s)]
*  I think people struggle when there's not that like typical big picture storyline [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=574.42s)]
*  to grab onto, which is like LeBron's doing this podcast with Nash right now. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=579.06s)]
*  And it seems like every time he does it, something comes out of it that then moves [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=583.1800000000001s)]
*  into the cycle of how people talk about sports now. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=587.1800000000001s)]
*  And I don't know if that's the cycle that represents how everyone talks about [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=590.1800000000001s)]
*  sports, but it's that weird ESPN show driven. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=593.1s)]
*  So like recently, LeBron had this thing about how he's basically doing the thing [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=596.1s)]
*  where he's talking about his critics, but I don't know who the critics are who [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=601.7s)]
*  says, someone in city doesn't have a back and this is infuriating to him. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=604.66s)]
*  I don't know who the person is who said this. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=609.1800000000001s)]
*  It's probably somebody with like 80 followers. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=611.42s)]
*  Somehow he thought and that's what he took a great offense to that. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=614.74s)]
*  And then Stephen Nash kind of acted like, oh, I'm offended for you. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=618.5s)]
*  And yeah, it was this amorphous criticism, but it wasn't attributed to anybody. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=621.26s)]
*  And LeBron has 40,000 points, but people don't think he has a bag and that really [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=626.46s)]
*  offends him. And I'm thinking like LeBron has a lot of ways to score. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=631.86s)]
*  I think we all have appreciated that for a long time. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=636.46s)]
*  I mean, are there guys who have a bigger, larger bag? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=639.78s)]
*  I mean, yes, Kyrie Irving has a larger bag than LeBron James of things he can do [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=643.5s)]
*  with a basketball, but it's very clear which guy is better. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=648.9399999999999s)]
*  And it's like somehow it's like this is always this thing back and forth where [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=652.02s)]
*  it's like if somebody is great because they're physically imposing, they're [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=657.2199999999999s)]
*  insulted that people don't view them as more of a skilled craftsman. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=660.9799999999999s)]
*  But if someone does all skills and they're all talented, then it's like [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=665.18s)]
*  this guy isn't even that good. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=669.02s)]
*  Really? This is fake somehow. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=670.18s)]
*  It's like there's I don't know who is the person who's like, I'm happy the way I'm [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=671.98s)]
*  perceived. Like what NBA player is happy to make maybe Mike Connelly? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=675.74s)]
*  I don't know. This doesn't seem like anybody's happy with how other people view them. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=679.66s)]
*  Yeah, it's either all of it. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=683.3399999999999s)]
*  Maybe it's true for me and you. I don't know. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=684.8199999999999s)]
*  Maybe no one is pleased with how they are seen. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=686.1s)]
*  Well, it's like Kyrie is a good example. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=690.78s)]
*  Kyrie, the respect that everyone has for his skills in an offensive game is [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=692.86s)]
*  actually above what his actual quality and outcome is. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=696.34s)]
*  I mean, if we're going to talk about this stupid term bag, he has the best one. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=699.98s)]
*  I think, you know, I mean, in terms of finishing by the rim, the ability to [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=703.7s)]
*  handle the ball, the ability to see the floor, the ability to pass. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=706.98s)]
*  He's the best at that. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=709.74s)]
*  I think I've ever seen him any player ever then with my eyes. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=710.74s)]
*  But he's not one of the 50 best players I've ever seen. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=713.1s)]
*  You know, just that skills are an important means at a basketball camp. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=716.14s)]
*  He would kill it during the stations in the morning. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=720.14s)]
*  Kyrie Irving would destroy everyone. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=722.7800000000001s)]
*  But it's not the same as being, you know, I mean, I still I do think I'm more [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=724.6999999999999s)]
*  I defend him more than most people. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=728.98s)]
*  Like I think it was I was supporting the Dallas trade when it happened, I think. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=730.3399999999999s)]
*  But it is a I mean, LeBron now. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=734.02s)]
*  I mean, he's just it is interesting to see how he has sort of evolved [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=739.54s)]
*  as a person, like, you know, and we've really seen it in a way that we don't [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=745.4599999999999s)]
*  really see with most guys because no one is that famous for that long. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=748.4599999999999s)]
*  But we've really seen changes in him. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=752.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's almost like celebrities that have that, but not athletes, where we're [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=754.42s)]
*  with somebody for almost a quarter of a century at this point. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=758.34s)]
*  You know, I mean, it's like it's years ago now, but it's like everyone LeBron [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=762.66s)]
*  used to constantly chew his nails. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=768.06s)]
*  Remember that he chewed nails constantly on the sidelines. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=771.22s)]
*  And it was like, that's what like a little kid does in a way, you know, and I mean, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=774.34s)]
*  I'm not that's I'm not criticizing for doing it, but it's really interesting. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=777.98s)]
*  Like the things that we've seen him sort of shed and add over time, not as a [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=781.26s)]
*  basketball player, even just as a guy. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=786.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=788.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=789.74s)]
*  The things that he's added from an offensive standpoint, like he, like he can [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=789.9s)]
*  really punish people in the low post now. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=793.86s)]
*  And, and he has all of these different things he does down there. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=795.86s)]
*  And then I think his step back three, which he's really been doing since the [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=799.14s)]
*  mid two thousands, but now it's like one of his go-to shots, but I think we'll [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=804.22s)]
*  probably bother saying is that Durant, I can't believe we're talking about this, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=808.86s)]
*  but like people have this perception, Durant, myself included. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=811.98s)]
*  I think the rants, the best scoring forward of all time. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=815.4200000000001s)]
*  LeBron has been the most successful scoring forward of all time, but I think [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=818.4200000000001s)]
*  Durant just the ease of which he just gets to 35 points, like for this. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=822.1800000000001s)]
*  What? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=827.82s)]
*  I think the last time he didn't average 28 points a game was like 2009 or [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=828.0200000000001s)]
*  something, um, but we're talking about degrees, right? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=834.0600000000001s)]
*  LeBron, there's a lot of brute force with him and a lot of like fast break, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=837.98s)]
*  like just flying down where he's just a better athlete than everybody else. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=841.22s)]
*  There was a period when he was with the heat, when the thing that LeBron could [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=844.58s)]
*  do is late in the game, if the team needed a basket, he could just go in the [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=848.46s)]
*  paint and dunk on someone. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=852.74s)]
*  He didn't do it the whole game. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=853.9s)]
*  We only do it as good as Durant is a more skilled, probably offensive player, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=855.38s)]
*  definitely a more skilled offensive player than LeBron. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=860.7s)]
*  He never had that. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=862.62s)]
*  The brute force piece. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=863.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=864.98s)]
*  The thing where, I mean, he, you know, Durant can get a shot and get a great [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=866.0999999999999s)]
*  shot and go up over him, but he still has to make it, you know, he still has to get [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=871.02s)]
*  the shot. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=874.42s)]
*  There's still a chance he's going to rim out. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=874.6999999999999s)]
*  But when LeBron could just go to the basket and pretty much throw it, there [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=876.6999999999999s)]
*  was nothing you had, you could always concede that if Miami needed one point, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=880.2199999999999s)]
*  Cleveland needed two points, they could just do that. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=885.4599999999999s)]
*  Um, so it, you know, who is the greater player? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=887.74s)]
*  There's no question who's the greater player, but I, yet LeBron is still sort [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=890.5799999999999s)]
*  of offended that he's not seen as the greatest player in every context. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=894.22s)]
*  He kind of wants to be perceived as the greatest player in every possible way [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=898.5s)]
*  it could be gauged. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=901.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=902.3000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=903.38s)]
*  He's, he's one of the greatest scorers ever, but it probably, there's probably [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=903.62s)]
*  two other people that got mentioned against him and then he takes that as a, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=908.02s)]
*  you know, I just, I always love, I just want to know who said that he didn't have [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=913.26s)]
*  a back because that would just be a dumb, like whoever said that on a TV show or [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=916.86s)]
*  a radio show or a podcast, like that's somebody who doesn't watch basketball. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=920.94s)]
*  So you're arguing against somebody who's an idiot. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=924.38s)]
*  No, it's somebody who watches basketball and needs to say something. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=926.6600000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's, that's the weird thing. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=930.14s)]
*  It's like these guys all got to come up with something to say all the time. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=931.74s)]
*  And evidently they're going to say idiotic things because the expectation is you [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=934.78s)]
*  have to say something all the time. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=938.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, how do you put Shay Gilgis Alexander in a context as, you know, he's [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=939.9s)]
*  somebody that just gets them 32, 34, 38 points a game. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=945.1s)]
*  There's a case that he's already at this point of his career, as good of a score [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=950.06s)]
*  as Kobe Bryant ever was, but we're not, that's like a third rail. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=954.94s)]
*  Nobody's allowed to go there yet. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=958.1s)]
*  Cause Kobe averaged 35 a game in a season and he's perceived as this, you know, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=959.3s)]
*  like the other than Jordan, the pinnacle of two guard scores. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=963.86s)]
*  But I think what Shay is doing is on that level at this point. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=966.78s)]
*  Well, it's possible to make that argument right now. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=970.46s)]
*  Will that argument be able to be made in 10 years? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=972.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=975.66s)]
*  We're going to watch play for 10, you know, like he might be peaking right now. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=975.86s)]
*  This might be his, as you would say, his apex mountain. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=978.74s)]
*  Maybe he's on his apex mountain right now or the, um, but we'll see as [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=981.82s)]
*  time passes kind of, you know, it's, um, uh, well, that's what I put [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=985.7s)]
*  Duane May, right from, well, here's like a thing that's kind of interesting. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=991.9s)]
*  You know, I watch a lot of these playoff games with no volume. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=994.98s)]
*  Like I'm in the room with somebody else, my family, they're on the iPad and [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=999.54s)]
*  they're watching something narrative. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1003.34s)]
*  So I just walked without sound and I am continually amazed by how different [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1004.86s)]
*  the experience is to just watch a game as opposed to have someone attempt to [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1012.0600000000001s)]
*  describe it, like all this idea of him being a foul merchant, right? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1015.86s)]
*  Like when I'm watching this with no volume, to me, it seems like he gets by guys. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1018.94s)]
*  He's a great free throw shooter. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1023.82s)]
*  So he kind of, the contact is legitimate. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1024.98s)]
*  He's not like saying, he's not like pretending to get followed. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1027.6200000000001s)]
*  Um, you know, so he does this, you know, and it's when I'm watching [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1030.18s)]
*  without sound, it's like, well, this is a real effective thing. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1034.22s)]
*  But then when I watch it with sound on the first time it happens, even if they [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1037.06s)]
*  don't necessarily criticize him for it, they mentioned that other people have. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1041.3s)]
*  And you start talking about this thing. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1045.34s)]
*  And it seems to color everything. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1046.78s)]
*  I mean, like, um, I, the, it does strike me that like a lot of the things that [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1048.54s)]
*  we talk about, about, you know, it's simply just us reacting to what the [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1055.3s)]
*  announcers of the analysts say. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1061.42s)]
*  Like, it's not necessarily the reality of those statements. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1063.8200000000002s)]
*  It's just that this was said. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1066.5800000000002s)]
*  So we have to decide whether we agree with it or not. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1068.22s)]
*  So when I watch him play, like I like watching play, I like watching [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1070.8600000000001s)]
*  Brunson play, I like all these guys who apparently now are sort of [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1074.5s)]
*  perceived as being like an unwatchable sort of, like they have an unwatchable [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1077.5800000000002s)]
*  style and I never feel that way. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1083.3000000000002s)]
*  I'd rather see a guy, you know, get by a dude, kind of stop, get followed, try to [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1085.46s)]
*  get an one, then just guys running in the corner and just shooting threes over [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1091.3s)]
*  and over and over again. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1095.1s)]
*  That to me is, that is the least interesting thing. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1096.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1098.86s)]
*  And that's why I really liked this series because it's two teams that are doing, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1099.06s)]
*  that are zagging against where the NBA was going. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1102.6599999999999s)]
*  The only thing she does with, with fouls that I, that I do think he's guilty of [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1104.86s)]
*  is when he drives, especially when he drives to the right, he puts his left [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1108.98s)]
*  hand out as a, as a borderline, like stiff arm and kind of keeps it out there. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1112.98s)]
*  And then sometimes he'll try to lock the guy's arm or he'll just, it makes it [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1118.3799999999999s)]
*  look like he's getting fouled, but really he's the one that's sticking his arm out. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1122.94s)]
*  And the refs just fall for it, which I don't blame him for, but that's it. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1126.22s)]
*  I feel like they're officiating in the playoffs has been much better than [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1130.4199999999998s)]
*  during the regular season. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1134.22s)]
*  I've been, I've been, I like the level of they're letting them play. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1135.1399999999999s)]
*  Now some guys, he being one does seem to get like regular season calls. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1139.06s)]
*  Like they call fouls, he could draw a foul the way he would in January. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1144.4199999999998s)]
*  Or a lot of other guys can't like the other guys, like they just got to live with it. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1148.3s)]
*  But that's always been the case, right? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1151.82s)]
*  Isn't it's always been the assumption that, you know, the stars get the calls [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1153.1399999999999s)]
*  and he was the MVP, so he's going to get those calls. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1156.7s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1159.98s)]
*  I mean, you go back in history. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1160.62s)]
*  That's how it goes. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1162.78s)]
*  The only person who seems like he gets away with more than everybody else. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1163.78s)]
*  And I don't understand it as Caruso. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1168.34s)]
*  Like for a fact, he is way more handsy and way more physical and just [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1170.98s)]
*  constantly like peppering, peppering. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1176.46s)]
*  So it's almost like he's doing a Muay Thai class or something. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1179.3s)]
*  He's just kidding guys and they just kind of let him do it. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1181.94s)]
*  And I, they did in Denver series, they did in the last series and he's [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1185.18s)]
*  doing it in this series too. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1188.06s)]
*  And nobody else in the game gets away with it. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1189.66s)]
*  I don't understand that. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1191.6200000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1192.98s)]
*  There were some elements of that with the whole Houston Rockets team. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1193.22s)]
*  And there were some bits of this, uh, with like the Houston Cougar college team [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1196.42s)]
*  this year, it's kind of like, do you have a friend who constantly [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1200.82s)]
*  gossips about everyone? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1204.06s)]
*  You know, anybody like that who's just constantly gossiping. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1205.38s)]
*  That person is given more leeway to do that than other people. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1208.46s)]
*  You get used to it, right? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1212.78s)]
*  You're like, Oh, so they always talk shit about everybody, but that's just who they [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1214.14s)]
*  are. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1217.5s)]
*  Or if anybody else did it, it would be like, why is this, you know, so it's [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1217.78s)]
*  this, these teams like Caruso now has built in this idea that this is how he [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1221.3400000000001s)]
*  plays and either you're going to call foul on him on six consecutive possessions. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1224.74s)]
*  This is going to be out of the game or you're going to let it happen. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1228.74s)]
*  I think that this is a, it's to his credit in a way, but he has sort of [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1231.26s)]
*  socialized the ref to see him as a, like a sort of like a, uh, he's at a [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1235.06s)]
*  physical disadvantage that he has to make up through grit and they let him do. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1242.4199999999998s)]
*  I mean, it was, it's like the reverse of when they were just be like, well, for [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1246.7s)]
*  Shaq to get a foul, you have to hit him with a hammer. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1250.1399999999999s)]
*  Like we just are going to accept that. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1253.26s)]
*  Like, you know, we, you have to, we're just going to assume that he's that big [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1254.3799999999999s)]
*  and that strong. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1258.6599999999999s)]
*  It's just going to be contact every time. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1259.26s)]
*  So a lot of things that are fouls are just gone. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1260.6599999999999s)]
*  And that's what I think. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1262.1799999999998s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1263.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1263.98s)]
*  Shaq was like that. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1264.38s)]
*  And Rob Gronkowski was the other one who was like that. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1265.6200000000001s)]
*  They used to drive every Patriot fan nuts. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1268.14s)]
*  He just got officiated differently because he was so big. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1270.1000000000001s)]
*  It seemed unfair that he was going against like five, 10 cornerbacks and stuff. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1272.22s)]
*  Well, I mean, this is kind of, I guess, more of an abstract question, but if you [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1276.9s)]
*  were, uh, you know, like commissioner of the NBA or whatever, you were talking [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1280.54s)]
*  to the officiating crews, would you say you got to make sure everyone's [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1286.0600000000002s)]
*  officiated the same way? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1291.5s)]
*  Or do you have to sort of understand that some guys are going to be [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1293.02s)]
*  officiated differently? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1295.46s)]
*  Because I think the natural inclination is to say the former, and yet it [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1296.66s)]
*  doesn't really work, like you almost have to do the latter. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1299.54s)]
*  Well, so game six at Nick's Pacers was interesting in that respect. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1303.02s)]
*  I remember talking about it afterwards where Brunson and Halliburton were [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1306.3000000000002s)]
*  boaches getting mauled and they were just kind of, they, the refs, I guess, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1311.1000000000001s)]
*  just agreed before the game. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1314.6200000000001s)]
*  We're just going to let this go. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1315.8200000000002s)]
*  Halliburton was just dribbling up the court, like on pseudo fast brakes and [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1317.14s)]
*  people were just shoving him and pushing him and they just weren't calling it. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1321.22s)]
*  But they weren't calling on Brunson either. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1324.46s)]
*  I'm good with it's at, I don't like the special treatment stuff. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1325.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1329.18s)]
*  I, I think these games are more interesting when there's more contact. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1329.42s)]
*  So we're in this stretch where OKC, a team that I feel like people can't get a [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1333.46s)]
*  handle on because the defense is so good. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1342.06s)]
*  Defense is something that's never really resonated with people in the same way. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1344.42s)]
*  Like the 2000 Ravens, you know, that it just doesn't work as well as offense [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1348.14s)]
*  because people understand offense better. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1354.66s)]
*  So you have that, you have Indiana that doesn't, that their star is somebody [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1356.22s)]
*  that is a guy who averages 18 points a game in the playoffs and people are [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1360.2600000000002s)]
*  like, he's got to step up. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1363.74s)]
*  It's like, this is who he is. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1364.66s)]
*  So he averages 18 points and 10 assists a game and leads the team [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1365.7800000000002s)]
*  and makes everybody better. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1369.7800000000002s)]
*  He's not a, I got to step up guy. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1370.8200000000002s)]
*  They're better when he's the second or third leading score. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1373.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1375.62s)]
*  But I actually believe score. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1376.58s)]
*  That's the best. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1377.86s)]
*  And he, you know, I feel, you know, yeah, he's, he's a facilitator. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1378.62s)]
*  He's, he's exactly like what Nash was like 20 years ago. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1382.58s)]
*  Nash wanted to be at 20 points, 14 assists and make everybody better. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1385.26s)]
*  And that's what he did. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1390.78s)]
*  But people seem to miss that with them. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1391.46s)]
*  Um, but in general, like, I like the styles. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1393.86s)]
*  I think the games three and four in Indiana are going to be really good. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1397.98s)]
*  And yet the series we're going to come out of and people are like, that was a failure. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1401.78s)]
*  The NBA is in trouble with this. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1405.4199999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1406.9399999999998s)]
*  See, oh my God, they're going to be better two years from now than they are now. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1407.26s)]
*  This could be like a little mini dynasty that we have. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1410.6999999999998s)]
*  And none of us even know how we really feel about this team. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1413.4599999999998s)]
*  It's almost like you need some sort of controversy scandal, um, bad [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1416.2199999999998s)]
*  blood behind the scenes, something for people to care beyond just the basketball [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1422.34s)]
*  stuff, that's what the Lakers did. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1426.06s)]
*  So brilliantly, right? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1427.5s)]
*  Shaq would show up fat every season. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1428.7s)]
*  Kobe would get mad at Shaq. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1431.02s)]
*  Phil Jackson would do these veiled barbs and everybody, it always seemed like [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1433.02s)]
*  they were teetering on a collapse and they would pull it together for the [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1436.58s)]
*  playoffs and people are like, this is amazing. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1439.1s)]
*  This is exactly what I want. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1441.34s)]
*  Whereas okay. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1443.02s)]
*  So he's just like, we all like each other. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1443.5s)]
*  We're just going to keep winning. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1445.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1446.82s)]
*  Well, it does seem like there's a basketball thing to discuss, which is. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1447.02s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1453.98s)]
*  It's so odd now you're watching a game. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1454.62s)]
*  And it's the second quarter and one team is up by 19 points. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1457.1799999999998s)]
*  But then you're in this weird situation where you're like, well, it's not so common [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1462.1s)]
*  for this team for anyone to come back from that deficit. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1466.1399999999999s)]
*  Like you don't feel safe at all. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1470.06s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1471.9399999999998s)]
*  So I got to keep watching and then possibly like, I mean, in game two, where [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1472.26s)]
*  it just never really changes, you know? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1476.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1478.1799999999998s)]
*  But then with four minutes left in these down 20, no, in these down 20 with four [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1478.34s)]
*  minutes left, and I'm like, ah, they could still do this. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1482.9399999999998s)]
*  Like, which is insane. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1485.4599999999998s)]
*  I was early. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1487.1s)]
*  I, what happened is I kind of lost kind of attention, but I was kind of following [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1488.1799999999998s)]
*  the score and at one point it sort of tightened up a little bit, but it's just, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1492.3799999999999s)]
*  it's a, it's a weird thing. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1495.62s)]
*  It's like, it's like, it's weird if it's fun to have these great comes backs, but [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1497.9399999999998s)]
*  it's also strange if all leads are meaningless, you know, but because everyone [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1502.54s)]
*  shoots nothing but threes, if you shoot a little better than your opponent and they [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1507.1s)]
*  shoot a little under what they normally do, it becomes like a 25 point margin. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1511.1399999999999s)]
*  And I don't know how that can be fixed. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1514.74s)]
*  Well, the other thing that changed it, like the, the Celtics were the [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1516.5400000000002s)]
*  guiltiest of all of this, where they have a lead and then they change how they play [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1519.26s)]
*  because they slow it down and they're trying to protect it. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1524.5800000000002s)]
*  And that seems like that screws up a lot of stuff too. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1526.7800000000002s)]
*  It's interesting with, uh, this, cause I was thinking about Scotty Schaeffer too. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1529.18s)]
*  The U S open is coming this week and he has like the best odds to win a major in a [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1532.98s)]
*  while. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1537.7s)]
*  I think he's like under, it's like plus two 70 or something. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1537.98s)]
*  Cause he's been that great. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1541.3400000000001s)]
*  I think he's won 10 majors in the last year and a half. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1542.8600000000001s)]
*  But people think he's boring and there's no like Scotty Schaeffer. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1546.9s)]
*  We would never have a Scotty Schaeffer argument. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1552.0200000000002s)]
*  I would never call you and be like, Hey, I just wanted to talk to Scotty Schaeffer [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1554.14s)]
*  with you for 15 minutes. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1557.9s)]
*  And you'd be like, what? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1559.18s)]
*  Talk about Scotty Schaeffer. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1561.0200000000002s)]
*  What is there to say? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1562.1000000000001s)]
*  Um, Tim Duncan was like this and the kind of that 2003 to Oh five range or is like, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1563.66s)]
*  yeah, Tim Duncan's really good. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1569.66s)]
*  And we just immediately ran out of stuff to say, I wonder if, I wonder if SGA has [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1570.7800000000002s)]
*  moved in there, but Schaeffer to me is the number one where he's like dominating [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1575.38s)]
*  golf now in a way that we have not seen since Tiger Woods, but people don't find [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1579.3000000000002s)]
*  him that interesting. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1585.3000000000002s)]
*  So it's just kind of happening over here. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1586.22s)]
*  You know, I have one with Pete Sampras. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1588.5400000000002s)]
*  I felt for awhile. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1589.7s)]
*  That's a good one. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1590.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1591.5800000000002s)]
*  You know, where, um, uh, the, where the news just kind of becomes, Oh, he won [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1591.8200000000002s)]
*  again and it isn't, no one is excited that it happened. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1597.6200000000001s)]
*  It just kind of seems like almost that, uh, that was the inevitable outcome. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1602.5s)]
*  Uh, I mean, basketball is the upside that there's more guys, right? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1606.7s)]
*  So when you were saying that, like Duncan, there were many people to talk about and [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1610.54s)]
*  many things to discuss about golf, I suppose is different, although there's more [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1613.98s)]
*  personalities in golf now that I can remember for awhile, but I don't [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1617.02s)]
*  really follow it either. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1620.02s)]
*  So, yeah, it's almost like when Scotty Schaeffer would happen that thing when [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1620.78s)]
*  he got arrested for six hours, easily the most exciting thing that's ever happened [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1626.54s)]
*  with him otherwise he's just dusting dudes in these tournaments and people [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1631.34s)]
*  were like, Holy shit. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1634.6999999999998s)]
*  Uh, we had to take a break and I want to talk about franchise moods, the NBA [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1635.78s)]
*  finals in full swing and our buddies at Vandal Sportsbook are here all the way [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1639.5s)]
*  with you, uh, we have an all customer profit boost for every single game in [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1645.02s)]
*  the series. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1650.1799999999998s)]
*  That's right. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1650.8999999999999s)]
*  You heard me use your profit boost bet, which team's going to win. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1651.26s)]
*  Who's going to drop 30. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1654.74s)]
*  You can build a parlay for a shot at an even bigger parlay, whatever you want to [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1656.34s)]
*  do. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1659.86s)]
*  If your bets win, you'll win even bigger and you can do it all again the next day. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1659.98s)]
*  So like, for instance, if you think Indiana is going to win game three of [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1665.98s)]
*  the NBA finals, I would probably do the over with that because that means the [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1669.6599999999999s)]
*  pace is going to be faster. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1673.78s)]
*  Maybe do see Ockham over rebounds, Indiana or win in the over in the game. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1675.3799999999999s)]
*  Maybe Halbert and six assists, put it together, get ready to go. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1680.6599999999999s)]

*  Franchise relocations. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1717.5s)]
*  I was thinking about this in the context of the Sonics, a topic that I've brought [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1719.02s)]
*  up a million times that I wrote multiple columns about that I keep bringing up on [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1723.34s)]
*  this podcast, but I was starting to wonder about them in the context historically [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1728.1s)]
*  of most devastating franchise relocations ever, because Seattle doesn't just lose [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1733.3s)]
*  professional basketball starting in 2008. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1738.02s)]
*  Going forward. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1741.22s)]
*  They also lose. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1742.26s)]
*  The rant. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1745.3799999999999s)]
*  Russell Westbrook, who's who had just been drafted by them, but they're about to [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1747.42s)]
*  leave Sam Presti, who I would say is probably the been, been the smartest GM [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1750.8999999999999s)]
*  of the last 20 years. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1757.58s)]
*  Um, and then all this stuff that happens all the way through the, they don't win [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1759.34s)]
*  a title, but then they have this rebirth or, you know, built around the Paul George [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1763.6599999999999s)]
*  trade a couple of times, and now they have this like dynasty potentially sitting there. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1768.18s)]
*  And you're in Seattle going, it was already horrific that we lost our team, that [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1772.46s)]
*  we lost the 1979 champs and this imbalical cord. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1777.66s)]
*  We had the basketball and people loved that team, but now we have to watch this [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1780.94s)]
*  other team basically become a rocket ship. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1784.7800000000002s)]
*  And I was trying to think what, what's worse for a franchise that only one I [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1788.26s)]
*  could think of that's like definitively worse is the Brooklyn Dodgers. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1793.26s)]
*  Going to LA like that one is like, that's has to be number one. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1798.5400000000002s)]
*  That still gets brought up all the time. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1803.14s)]
*  It's the weirdest thing. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1804.7s)]
*  And sort of like people, you know, they, you know, we still call, you know, middle [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1805.5400000000002s)]
*  school kids playing baseball, playing Babe Ruth baseball. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1809.3400000000001s)]
*  It's like, he's like a hundred years later. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1811.66s)]
*  We still use that term as the Brooklyn Dodgers thing that still comes up whenever [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1813.26s)]
*  18 moves, you know, when, when the Browns left Cleveland, I had that too, it was a [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1818.3400000000001s)]
*  cataclysmic deal for Cleveland, but then they got the team back so quickly. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1823.26s)]
*  And they retained the colors and all that stuff. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1828.3400000000001s)]
*  And they did have to see the six seed. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1830.22s)]
*  Um, but, uh, so, so here's what I have. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1833.94s)]
*  And I don't even know if this is a rankings, but these were the eight [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1839.3400000000001s)]
*  that really jumped out to me. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1842.0600000000002s)]
*  Brooklyn losing the Dodgers is one. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1843.9s)]
*  And I think, I think the Giants moving to San Francisco is another one. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1845.7800000000002s)]
*  Cause you think of baseball back then in the, you know, in the twenties, thirties, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1849.7s)]
*  forties, fifties, and the three New York teams were the hub of major league [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1853.46s)]
*  baseball, right? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1857.42s)]
*  There were other teams, but it was like having those three there. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1858.0600000000002s)]
*  That was it. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1860.9s)]
*  They were the epicenter. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1861.3400000000001s)]
*  And then by the time we got to the sixties, there was only one team left. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1862.78s)]
*  They had to bring the Mets back in, but the Giants going to San Francisco, the [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1865.9s)]
*  Colts going to Indianapolis, especially how they left kind of out of nowhere. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1869.74s)]
*  Left in the middle of the night. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1874.18s)]
*  And it, but the, and you know, and if Baltimore had had like, uh, they [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1875.78s)]
*  hadn't been good for a while, but they had such a deep tradition, you know, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1882.14s)]
*  that was still built into the town, you know, United us and all that stuff. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1885.7s)]
*  So that was a bad one. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1889.22s)]
*  That was a bad one, but they end up, they get the Ravens back, right? [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1890.5400000000002s)]
*  So it gets a little tempered by that. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1894.1000000000001s)]
*  Same thing for, there was a pretty big gap between that though. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1896.3000000000002s)]
*  It was a lot of years. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1899.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1900.3400000000001s)]
*  And, you know, speaking of that, the Browns going to Baltimore, same thing, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1901.22s)]
*  which you could see coming, you could see coming, but they only don't have [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1905.22s)]
*  the Browns for four years, devastated to lose them, but only for four. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1908.22s)]
*  Sonics to KC. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1914.1s)]
*  They haven't had a basketball team since and their basketball team that left [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1915.3s)]
*  ended up basically becoming, you know, Facebook stock or Amazon stock or whatever. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1919.7s)]
*  Like it's, it wasn't just that they left. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1926.22s)]
*  They became multi-billionaires when they left. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1928.34s)]
*  Um, I think a really underrated one is the whalers going to Carolina because, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1930.8999999999999s)]
*  and I would also throw in the Nordics going to Denver and, um, and the, uh, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1937.58s)]
*  the stars going to Dallas. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1942.02s)]
*  Well, I, the, when I heard the North stars were going to Dallas, like I'm not [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1943.82s)]
*  somebody who follows hockey, but I thought like this is, cause I had sort of, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1947.54s)]
*  when I was a kid, you know, adjacent to Minnesota, it seemed like. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1951.54s)]
*  Oddly, the two franchises that mattered the most were the twins and the North [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1957.5s)]
*  stars, not, you know, like football is more popular than anything. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1963.6999999999998s)]
*  So of course the Vikings maybe mattered the most, but the twins [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1967.9399999999998s)]
*  and the North star seemed more reflective of the town. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1971.62s)]
*  Like, like it was like a cause hockey's huge in Minnesota and the twins were. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1975.1799999999998s)]
*  Um, so I was, but people handled it. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1980.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1983.02s)]
*  It didn't, it didn't seem to be as devastating as I thought it was going to be. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1983.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1986.8999999999999s)]
*  Well, and they ended up getting one back. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1987.26s)]
*  And then the only other one. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1989.1399999999999s)]
*  So Buffalo loses the Braves to the Clippers. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1991.78s)]
*  They moved to San Diego. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1996.1799999999998s)]
*  They never get another NBA team. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=1998.5s)]
*  Now Buffalo is not a huge city, but I think. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2000.46s)]
*  You lose your team and you never replace the team. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2004.1000000000001s)]
*  That's probably the worst. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2007.3s)]
*  Um, you know, like the Colts go in Indianapolis was, was like somebody's [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2008.9s)]
*  wife just packing up and leaving in the middle of the night. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2014.14s)]
*  Like that's that, that was like the biggest gut punch probably, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2016.7s)]
*  but they did get a team back. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2019.22s)]
*  Um, I still feel like Brooklyn losing the Dodgers is the worst one. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2021.14s)]
*  Just because people have talked about that for generations. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2025.46s)]
*  Because in most of these situations, I get the sense that if once we get to a [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2030.6200000000001s)]
*  generation who doesn't remember the team being there, then it's not that big of a [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2036.82s)]
*  deal anymore. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2040.14s)]
*  Like you can't, you can't have this memory of this team that was never in [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2041.1000000000001s)]
*  town, but the Brooklyn Dodgers are the exception to that. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2043.9s)]
*  They're like people who of course had, I mean, there's not many people around who [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2047.18s)]
*  were like watching the Brooklyn Dodgers play and still come up. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2050.18s)]
*  Like, I feel like a guy, I feel like the New York mayor, some of their guy running [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2053.78s)]
*  for mayor recently made a reference to the Dodgers leaving Brooklyn, you know, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2057.14s)]
*  leaving town or whatever. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2061.58s)]
*  That, that, that's part of their DNA was their DNA was they hated the Yankees, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2062.94s)]
*  right? [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2067.8599999999997s)]
*  The Yankees always beat them. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2068.06s)]
*  So you couldn't then be like, okay, now I'll switch to the Yankees. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2069.7799999999997s)]
*  Cause that was, there are travel. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2072.62s)]
*  My dad grew up in Brooklyn and was a Dodgers fan as a kid. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2073.8599999999997s)]
*  And he didn't have a baseball team really for the next, I don't know, 12, 13 [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2077.58s)]
*  years until he was living in, uh, in Boston and started reading for the Red Sox [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2083.06s)]
*  during the, when he was going to college and the 67 Red Sox kind of got him back [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2087.38s)]
*  in, but that was, I don't know, 12 years later. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2091.14s)]
*  And he's just like, they, even the Mets came and they're like, fuck it. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2094.9s)]
*  A lot of, and some people stayed with the Dodgers. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2097.62s)]
*  Like I've got my friend Hershey, his dad, even though they left stayed with the [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2100.5s)]
*  Dodgers, which is like a really hard thing to do because you're just basically reading [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2105.02s)]
*  newspaper box scores and then occasionally they're on TV. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2108.46s)]
*  Anyway, I feel like the Sonics has moved up the ladder. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2112.14s)]
*  I think they've passed the Browns. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2115.3399999999997s)]
*  I think they've passed the Colts. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2117.46s)]
*  I think you could even argue that past the giants when the giants moved to San [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2119.74s)]
*  Francisco, because the Mets basically replaced the giants in the national league. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2123.18s)]
*  I think a lot of the New York giants fans jumped there. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2127.02s)]
*  I think it's the second worst now to lose a basketball, to lose professional [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2129.66s)]
*  basketball for 18 years. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2134.22s)]
*  And then on top of it, have your team become this team that was incredibly fun [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2136.94s)]
*  to watch and had some of the best players in the league. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2140.74s)]
*  Like it's a continued gun punch and not talked about ever. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2142.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2148.06s)]
*  I, I, uh, like would things have played out the same if the team stays in Seattle? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2148.2599999999998s)]
*  I guess that's a hard thing to know. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2154.22s)]
*  You know, hold on there. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2155.9799999999996s)]
*  That's so that's one of the great what ifs of this century. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2157.1s)]
*  Remember I wrote my book. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2160.14s)]
*  I did my what ifs chapter. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2161.18s)]
*  This is a completely different Kevin Durant conversation. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2163.54s)]
*  If they just stay in Seattle, they're going to have a lot of money, right? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2168.02s)]
*  Because Seattle is, I think very similar to Silicon Valley, like how the [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2170.3s)]
*  warriors became the superpower. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2173.98s)]
*  Even though the warriors were a mess up until the early 2010s, then they had all [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2175.6600000000003s)]
*  this money that came in and they just built the superpower. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2180.1800000000003s)]
*  They could have built it. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2183.1800000000003s)]
*  I just don't think the rain ever leaves. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2183.82s)]
*  I think he's Seattle for life. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2185.82s)]
*  I think he's still there. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2187.42s)]
*  I think he's like Kobe on the Lakers for Seattle. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2188.5800000000004s)]
*  I really do. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2191.02s)]
*  I don't think he ever leaves. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2192.1400000000003s)]
*  That mean I guess it's possible. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2194.5800000000004s)]
*  That just happens so rarely with anybody. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2196.2200000000003s)]
*  And he does not. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2198.4599999999996s)]
*  He, I mean, he, he's kind of a wandering spirit or whatever. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2200.1s)]
*  He became a wandering spirit. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2203.54s)]
*  He stayed in OKC for nine years or eight years. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2205.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2208.54s)]
*  Sure. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2209.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2210.3799999999997s)]
*  Um, I think he eventually became a wandering spirit, but I don't know. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2210.8199999999997s)]
*  I don't think he leaves. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2214.18s)]
*  Cause I think unless him and Westbrook grew up, that would have been the [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2215.22s)]
*  only way that that blows up. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2218.22s)]
*  I think. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2219.66s)]
*  So Durant and journeyman. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2221.54s)]
*  And if so, if not, who's the greatest NBA journeyman of all time? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2224.5s)]
*  Does he not classify as a journeyman? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2228.2599999999998s)]
*  No, he's too good to be a journeyman. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2230.2599999999998s)]
*  I think he's a nomad. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2231.58s)]
*  How many franchises you've been with? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2233.3399999999997s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2234.62s)]
*  One, two, three, four franchises now. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2234.8599999999997s)]
*  About to be five. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2238.62s)]
*  What's five. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2239.8199999999997s)]
*  So you can play for five teams and not be a journeyman. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2240.9399999999996s)]
*  Who is the greatest journeyman? [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2243.2599999999998s)]
*  But journeyman means you, you were just bounced around like you were James Posey. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2244.66s)]
*  But, but I have feeling like a lot of guys you're going to bring up are going [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2248.8599999999997s)]
*  to have played for less than five teams. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2252.02s)]
*  When we think of, you know, classic journeyman. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2254.7799999999997s)]
*  What about Shaq? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2256.7s)]
*  Unless, unless. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2257.46s)]
*  Is Shaq a journeyman then? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2258.42s)]
*  Shaq played for Orlando, the Lakers, Phoenix, Cleveland, and the Celtics. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2259.66s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2263.86s)]
*  I guess if you have a, if you have a bunch of franchises right at the end, it [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2264.42s)]
*  makes it seem less journeyish. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2268.82s)]
*  You know, it's people that the journey has to be along the way. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2271.02s)]
*  Um, I mean, there also is like a sort of pejorative meaning, like, you know, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2274.06s)]
*  like the journeyman all-star who have been journeyman all-stars. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2280.1s)]
*  Moses Malone was played for a lot of different franchises and he was great in [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2283.8199999999997s)]
*  every one, uh, well, not at the end, but for the early ones, certainly. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2287.98s)]
*  Moses is a good one. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2291.3399999999997s)]
*  Moses, I think played for like six or seven teams, if you include the ABA. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2292.18s)]
*  Yeah, but we would never classify him as a journeyman, I guess, you know, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2296.02s)]
*  I wouldn't journeyman is to me means you are a role player. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2299.22s)]
*  Always. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2302.58s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2303.06s)]
*  So I think I would use Nomad. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2303.54s)]
*  Probably Robert Horry. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2307.7s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2309.9399999999996s)]
*  So he played for how many franchises? [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2310.22s)]
*  Houston, Phoenix, Detroit, San Antonio, the Lakers. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2312.58s)]
*  They need a journeyman. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2317.02s)]
*  Cause he played for a lot of franchises and always at, you know, we was the fourth [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2320.1s)]
*  best or fifth best player in Boston. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2324.46s)]
*  Then he was the best player in Sacramento for a little bit. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2326.38s)]
*  Then he helped out the Blazers when he was there. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2329.34s)]
*  Portland. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2332.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2333.8199999999997s)]
*  And that's four teams. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2335.02s)]
*  Um, that's a, that's a good one. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2336.62s)]
*  Robert Horry is probably the best version of it. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2340.7000000000003s)]
*  I would say. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2342.58s)]
*  Cause it was, he had a thing about, he was on, I mean, all these guys go on podcasts [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2343.82s)]
*  now, he did a thing about how he should be in the hall of fame. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2348.1s)]
*  And I was like, I agree with him. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2350.78s)]
*  I think he's one of the best, he's probably the best big spot role player in the [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2352.7000000000003s)]
*  history of the league, other than maybe a couple of guys who were on the 50, 60 [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2358.66s)]
*  Celtics. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2362.3s)]
*  Um, I, when I did my pyramid for my book, I had him in the pyramid. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2363.38s)]
*  There's no, been no career like him. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2367.26s)]
*  So I think I agree. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2370.66s)]
*  I mean, he actually, if I, if I heard he was going in the, I mean, if you look at [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2374.14s)]
*  say his career in Mitch Richmond, Mitch Richmond's career, like who had a better [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2377.54s)]
*  career and Richmond's in the hall of fame and he's not, um, you know, well that [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2381.14s)]
*  was not to criticize Mitch Richmond. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2386.38s)]
*  He's kind of an easy example, but I mean, like he was, I'm not saying he wasn't a [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2387.86s)]
*  great player, but he doesn't seem like a hall of fame player to me. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2391.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2394.9s)]
*  One of the things I had when I did that thing in my pyramid was about, if you ask [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2395.06s)]
*  somebody remember the Robert horror game, they would say which one that's when you [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2399.86s)]
*  know, you've had a good career. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2404.58s)]
*  Like, oh yeah. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2405.82s)]
*  The Robert horror game. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2406.54s)]
*  It's like, you mean the one in 2002, you're talking about the one in the [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2407.38s)]
*  Oh five finals. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2411.2200000000003s)]
*  Like you'd have to, you, when he knocked over Steve Nash, like which one, uh, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2412.06s)]
*  which one would you do? [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2417.7400000000002s)]
*  But yeah, I think the rant, I think that's, that's an unbelievable what if I [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2418.6200000000003s)]
*  think is we could be talking about him completely differently. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2423.7000000000003s)]
*  He could have like four titles. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2426.82s)]
*  We would, he would be like indisputed. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2428.46s)]
*  One of the best six or seven guys. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2430.34s)]
*  Do you think if he stays with that franchise, they went four titles? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2432.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2436.42s)]
*  I mean, why, why would that, you know, why, why would that have happened? [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2439.58s)]
*  He's won two titles when he went to the warriors, but why would, if he stays [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2443.9s)]
*  as they were, you can make an argument, they would have spent more money the [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2450.34s)]
*  first eight, nine years he was in. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2454.1800000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2455.82s)]
*  See, because they would have had more money because they were in a bigger market. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2456.1400000000003s)]
*  And like, you don't have to trade hard in right before he's due for some [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2459.6600000000003s)]
*  extension because you're not worried about it because whatever you pay the luxury [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2464.6600000000003s)]
*  tax, um, are they in a position to draft West Westbrook? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2468.1800000000003s)]
*  Are they in a, they had Westbrook already. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2472.1000000000004s)]
*  They had Durant Westbrook. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2473.86s)]
*  They had all this. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2475.2200000000003s)]
*  Westbrook was drafted by Seattle and then they moved. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2477.1400000000003s)]
*  His first year was in Oklahoma city. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2480.9s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2482.98s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2483.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2484.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean, I can't, I can't really say like that never would have happened, but I [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2485.9s)]
*  don't know why necessarily him staying in Seattle would have won them for [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2488.0600000000004s)]
*  championships. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2490.94s)]
*  I think they, maybe they had a one, one championship, maybe if you [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2491.5800000000004s)]
*  could argue they were super close. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2494.46s)]
*  From 2011 on. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2497.26s)]
*  And if they had operated, like say the warriors and made some big money [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2499.98s)]
*  plays with like a bigger cap, maybe that would have been the difference. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2504.5800000000004s)]
*  I mean, that's a lot. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2507.6200000000003s)]
*  You're asking a lot now. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2508.38s)]
*  They got to totally operate their franchise differently. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2509.7400000000002s)]
*  But then if he doesn't go to golden state, those are two available [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2512.42s)]
*  potentially. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2515.42s)]
*  I'm just saying it's a, it's a thought experiment. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2517.7s)]
*  I think could you, could you have one up to four titles possible? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2519.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2522.94s)]
*  What was the thing about the move that like just in sort of the general sense [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2525.02s)]
*  is that Seattle was a, I guess the city that I thought was one of the rare towns [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2528.42s)]
*  where basketball was the most important sport it felt like. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2533.02s)]
*  I agree. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2536.02s)]
*  There are some sports cities where baseball is the most important sport, a [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2536.9s)]
*  whole most important sport, a whole bunch of football is, but I felt like [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2539.42s)]
*  Seattle was one where it was basketball. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2542.54s)]
*  So it is a bummer that they don't have a NBA team. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2544.1s)]
*  I mean, it seems that there should be an NBA because you know, and it's weird [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2548.06s)]
*  that Portland has one in Seattle. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2551.1s)]
*  Doesn't it's just strange. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2552.38s)]
*  Well, they're going to have one soon. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2553.86s)]
*  That brings us to our next topic, which I gave you a heads up on about this [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2555.9s)]
*  international basketball league that might be happening because there's been, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2560.1s)]
*  there's some information popping out. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2563.7799999999997s)]
*  I haven't talked about it that much in my podcast. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2565.2599999999998s)]
*  I'm still not positive it's going to happen, but I think in the rich guy [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2567.02s)]
*  circles, a lot of them are talking about it because a lot of them have been asked [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2570.7s)]
*  to invest in it and I don't know the exact number, but I know I have an idea [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2574.2999999999997s)]
*  of the, uh, the premise, which is they basically want it to be like F one and [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2583.2999999999997s)]
*  it's this international league. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2591.02s)]
*  They play less games and they go to different spots all over the world. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2592.9399999999996s)]
*  So they go to like Singapore, they go to, you know, Monaco, wherever the hell it is, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2597.7799999999997s)]
*  almost operating like F one and they go there and they're there for like, I don't [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2602.3799999999997s)]
*  know, 10 days and they're played multiple games in the same spot. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2606.3799999999997s)]
*  And then they have all this other stuff that happens. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2609.9799999999996s)]
*  Like there's like concerts and it's like an event. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2612.8199999999997s)]
*  It's like almost like a takeover the same way F one does it. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2615.3799999999997s)]
*  And you move from spot to spot and maybe it's like a 30, 35 game season. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2618.54s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2622.7s)]
*  Um, and what they're telling people is that they have a couple of major [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2623.62s)]
*  stars that are going to be joining that are going to be jaw dropping. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2628.3399999999997s)]
*  And I, it's pretty clear cause maverick Carter is running this that, or is like [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2631.74s)]
*  one of the people involved in pushing it that he's dangling LeBron is going to be [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2636.5s)]
*  one of the people that do it. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2640.46s)]
*  Could it be Kevin Durant? [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2642.18s)]
*  My, my guess is it's probably older, older famous superstars nearing the end of [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2643.3399999999997s)]
*  their career who are just going to do where they would get a bunch of money, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2648.5s)]
*  probably equity in the league. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2653.66s)]
*  Um, and it's a financial play and you try to build something. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2655.7s)]
*  I guess I have a few questions. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2660.38s)]
*  One of which is, will people watch this? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2662.5s)]
*  And also does it matter? [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2666.9s)]
*  Because like when you saw like the Kobe China stuff, that was the first time I [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2668.38s)]
*  was like, wow, people love this shit. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2672.66s)]
*  Like you remember when Bob McAdoo went to Italy for like four extra years in the [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2674.46s)]
*  eighties and became like a God in Italy. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2678.94s)]
*  Like maybe this is a smarter way to end your career, to make more money and you're [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2681.9s)]
*  global and you hit all these different countries and you blow up your brand that [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2686.94s)]
*  way. Cause you've kind of taken everything you could possibly can out of kind of [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2690.26s)]
*  the American NBA culture. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2693.98s)]
*  Um, I just don't know if the league works and what that would look like. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2696.02s)]
*  And so I'm laying all this out to you. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2699.86s)]
*  What's your instant reaction? [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2701.46s)]
*  Well, I, it doesn't seem like it would work to me as an American product. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2703.62s)]
*  And so I'm saying, I can't imagine it being, it being very interesting to American [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2709.7s)]
*  audiences. And I think the idea of if like, if it was like LeBron and Durant and [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2716.06s)]
*  those guys at their age, if they come out and they seem like shells of themselves, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2722.22s)]
*  um, that would be very, uh, kind of disenchanting to people. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2727.18s)]
*  If they play well, it would be like, well, this league is a joke. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2731.8199999999997s)]
*  These guys are 40 years old and they're dominating. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2735.14s)]
*  I think that the American appetite for sports has kind of shifted over the last [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2737.22s)]
*  couple of decades. I think maybe in a small role, you maybe played a role in this, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2743.94s)]
*  in that the sense that like, that, that the, that the, the consumer of sports now [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2747.34s)]
*  is mostly interested in the highest possible excellence above anything else. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2752.9s)]
*  That like the idea of, of college sports or high school sports, I feel like that [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2759.1400000000003s)]
*  is receding. And, and I think that if you try to start a league and the level of [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2764.94s)]
*  play, um, seems like, uh, uh, like a, uh, two tiers below what we're used to seeing, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2770.46s)]
*  uh, that would fail. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2778.1800000000003s)]
*  I feel like they would need to go after the kind of person who loves this NBA [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2779.3s)]
*  finals, like people who are interested in international basketball. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2784.1800000000003s)]
*  It's a smaller audience, obviously it's a, you know, but I, I, I do think that [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2788.6200000000003s)]
*  there is a kind of person who loves basketball, who watches the NBA and they're [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2792.5400000000004s)]
*  like, I don't like this though. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2795.78s)]
*  And if, and when they, but when they see international players, they seem to be [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2797.46s)]
*  excited and titillated and they love to see Joker and they love to see Luca and [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2802.9s)]
*  they love to see the style of play. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2805.98s)]
*  They watch, you know, teen USA or whatever. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2807.1s)]
*  And they're like, I wish this was how the league was. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2809.62s)]
*  I think that would be the person you need to go after if you want to succeed in [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2811.7000000000003s)]
*  America, if the idea that it doesn't matter if it succeeds in America, if it's [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2814.98s)]
*  like this thing where it's like, these guys want to expand their brand into [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2818.26s)]
*  Taiwan and stuff like that. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2821.78s)]
*  And we just want to have these big events, I guess, but that's a different [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2823.26s)]
*  kinds of success. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2826.06s)]
*  I mean, to me, a successful league would mean that it's, it can exist on its own [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2827.34s)]
*  in America and to some degree rival. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2831.54s)]
*  You know, the NBA. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2834.58s)]
*  I don't think that's the goal. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2835.54s)]
*  I don't, I think America, any success in America would almost be a bonus. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2836.82s)]
*  Was my guess, like the worldwide stuff. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2842.34s)]
*  So it's a little different than, you know, live, I think live backs up your [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2844.66s)]
*  argument where people, it just hasn't resonated here because it's not all the [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2849.18s)]
*  best players. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2855.2599999999998s)]
*  Nobody really understands it. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2856.06s)]
*  It just hasn't worked. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2857.46s)]
*  Um, which I think is one of the reasons why it's been, but I would argue for the [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2858.94s)]
*  golfers, it's probably really worked because they've made way more money than [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2863.14s)]
*  they ever expected to make playing golf. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2866.2599999999998s)]
*  They would probably run it back and do it again. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2868.66s)]
*  So from a basketball standpoint, yeah. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2870.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2873.5s)]
*  So from a basketball standpoint, if you're just talking like, if you can make [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2873.74s)]
*  twice as much money, and I know these guys are making 50 million now, but if [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2877.46s)]
*  they could make a hundred million or they make 75 million, plus they get equity [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2881.54s)]
*  in this new entity and they look like they're at the cutting edge, I just, the [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2884.94s)]
*  history of sports says that some of these guys will bite, you know, like even [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2889.78s)]
*  the, think about like the ABA and the, uh, you know, WFL back in the day when, when [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2894.7400000000002s)]
*  we were growing up, it's always amazing to me how many people jumped. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2900.1800000000003s)]
*  The USFL was about as successful as you could imagine. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2904.6600000000003s)]
*  That didn't work. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2906.7400000000002s)]
*  But I mean, I, what the thing, the situation you're describing, I mean, is [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2907.26s)]
*  both plausible and I think we would both agree would be bad for the sport, right? [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2911.46s)]
*  Like this would not be good. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2918.7s)]
*  It would be, I think it'd be bad for the, for the NBA to not have guys kind [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2920.46s)]
*  of aging gracefully. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2926.78s)]
*  I think the sport, the sport that now I think there might be a woman's component [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2928.14s)]
*  to this too, this idea that's where it gets really interesting because the WNBA, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2933.98s)]
*  like the players really don't make the way that that league is so overleveraged [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2940.58s)]
*  with their finances that it's impossible to really pay the players. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2944.94s)]
*  Right? [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2948.38s)]
*  So they make all their money off the court. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2948.58s)]
*  But if you could basically, if you got Caitlin Clark to be involved in something [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2950.86s)]
*  like this and you gave her some crazy amount of money and she's traveling the [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2954.26s)]
*  world and she's playing 30 games a year and has equity in the league, that becomes [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2958.02s)]
*  more interesting to me because I do think people would follow her. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2962.86s)]
*  I, I don't think any NBA player in their prime would just pack up and go and leave. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2966.02s)]
*  Like, I can't see, like, maybe I should be careful because maybe one of these [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2972.66s)]
*  people do it, but I can't imagine like Yannis being like, okay, I'm good. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2977.54s)]
*  I won one title. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2981.14s)]
*  Now I'm going to just go grab some cash. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2982.1s)]
*  It really does seem like an end of the career thing as an idea. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2984.34s)]
*  I can see it possibly with an international player if they dislike the experience of [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2990.86s)]
*  living in America for whatever reason. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2995.58s)]
*  I mean, I don't know why that would be the case. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2997.14s)]
*  You would think their life, but if that was the case, maybe. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=2998.7s)]
*  Um, but, uh, like Wemby, like, could, could they get Wemby to be in this thing [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3001.66s)]
*  three years from now, if this, if this goes through, who knows he's from France. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3008.7799999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3012.8199999999997s)]
*  I don't know if he likes America, but he seems motivated to play against the best. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3013.46s)]
*  You would think. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3019.7s)]
*  Well, well, that's what he expresses, right? [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3020.98s)]
*  I mean, sometimes these guys live, if he's like the fact that he's, he's putting [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3024.14s)]
*  the effort into express that, whereas I don't always hear that from guys. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3028.46s)]
*  Well, is it, is it, uh, is it possible that a young player could do that? [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3032.38s)]
*  I think so. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3038.26s)]
*  I think that would be the possibility because, you know, these guys have such [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3039.58s)]
*  long careers now that they would be like, well, I can come back and maybe [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3043.2200000000003s)]
*  plan the NBA later. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3047.82s)]
*  I mean, this is like, this makes no sense in a way, but, you know, I think a lot [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3049.62s)]
*  about like load management and these problems and like these guys are just, [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3053.7s)]
*  you know, now we're in the playoffs and guys are getting hurt constantly. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3056.9s)]
*  And I think part of it is because it's so rare that they play hard this often. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3059.1400000000003s)]
*  I was thinking, why is this like, well, you know, what, and part of the reason is, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3065.26s)]
*  is that there's so much incentive to have a long career to play 18 years, you know, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3068.86s)]
*  cause you make so much money at the end, the numbers only get bigger. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3076.1800000000003s)]
*  But I think a lot of these guys are kind of thinking at the end when they're not [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3079.38s)]
*  even toward the middle. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3085.6200000000003s)]
*  They're like, I got to make sure that I have this long enough story to make the [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3086.46s)]
*  big money at the end. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3089.18s)]
*  Sometimes I think this would be an issue. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3090.3s)]
*  If after your 12th season, your salary is capped, whatever you're making in your [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3093.14s)]
*  12th year is your salary, yearly salary going on. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3098.86s)]
*  So if he's gotten so that, that, I don't, I think it's very strange now that [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3102.18s)]
*  you used to like, a 10 year career should be a long NBA career. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3107.94s)]
*  And now that's sort of expected. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3112.18s)]
*  Part of this is that these guys, they want to take every fourth day or day off trying [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3114.22s)]
*  to the end. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3118.7s)]
*  And it seems to me that if the deal was after your, whatever you're making in your 12th [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3119.54s)]
*  year, sort of becomes your standard, what you make per year going forward, even if [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3122.7s)]
*  the CBA changes, even if all these things changes, that's the number that there might [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3126.9399999999996s)]
*  be less of a, like it's, it would be hard to tell a guy. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3131.7s)]
*  It's like, well, you had to play hard now. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3135.46s)]
*  And if his argument is like, well, I also need to be able to play some in 10 years. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3137.74s)]
*  I think it's, it doesn't seem strange how long these guys play now that this has [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3143.02s)]
*  become like, you know, Chris Paul, what was his, what was his 20th year, 18th year? [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3147.82s)]
*  What year was he in this year? [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3151.94s)]
*  Well, they just, they take way better care of themselves. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3153.2599999999998s)]
*  I think here's, here's the problem. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3155.66s)]
*  The players are co-signing the schedule. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3158.54s)]
*  Like the schedule can't change unless the players are also willing to push to change [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3161.46s)]
*  it. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3165.82s)]
*  And they're not willing to push to change it because it goes to 70 games, which is [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3166.42s)]
*  where it should go. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3169.86s)]
*  Everyone would lose 12 home games and then everybody would lose 12, you know, I [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3171.42s)]
*  guess one sixth of their paycheck, whatever one seventh, everyone would lose six home [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3177.2999999999997s)]
*  games. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3181.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3182.66s)]
*  But you lose. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3183.8599999999997s)]
*  So you, but you'd sacrifice basically one seventh or one sixth, whatever it works [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3184.8199999999997s)]
*  out of your paycheck, you'd make less money. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3188.7s)]
*  The league would make less money. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3190.46s)]
*  And that's the reason it's happened. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3191.62s)]
*  Adam Silver actually said this in his press conference. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3192.98s)]
*  He's like, we're happy at 82. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3195.1s)]
*  We think it's fine. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3196.2999999999997s)]
*  He's wrong and it's, and it's terrible for the league. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3197.42s)]
*  And he should want to fix it and he should make it a crusade to fix it. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3200.46s)]
*  And it should be important to him. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3203.7s)]
*  And he doesn't care. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3205.62s)]
*  But I don't think the players care either. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3207.3s)]
*  And this is stuff they could have bargained for that they didn't. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3208.86s)]
*  I'm not sure going to 70 games would change load management that much. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3211.78s)]
*  And the guys attempting, I don't, I don't think that would be enough to, I think [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3216.06s)]
*  that they would still sort of perceive themselves as being guys who need to be [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3219.1s)]
*  ready for the playoffs. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3222.06s)]
*  I still think they would, you know, I think it would, I think it would [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3222.78s)]
*  unquestionably make the league better. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3226.42s)]
*  Unquestionably. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3228.34s)]
*  You would have, you'd basically be playing three games a week. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3229.3399999999997s)]
*  And I think three games a week is doable and you could even make it. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3233.22s)]
*  So you play like Tuesday, Friday, Sunday, or you play, you know, Monday, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3236.1s)]
*  Wednesday, Saturday, whatever it is, have some sort of routine. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3241.22s)]
*  I think it would, but all these leagues, like the NFL is going to go to 18 games. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3245.06s)]
*  There isn't a single person on the planet who thinks that's a good idea, but [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3249.62s)]
*  they're going to do it because the players have to do it because their careers are [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3253.1s)]
*  three years long, four years long, for the most part, 80% of them, their careers [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3256.98s)]
*  are done by the time they're 27. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3261.38s)]
*  So they know they're going to sign up for whatever. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3262.9s)]
*  And then they're just never going to cut back on games. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3265.5s)]
*  That's just not going to happen. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3267.38s)]
*  No, they'll probably, do you think they'll have 20 by the time we're in our 70s? [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3268.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3273.26s)]
*  They may have 22. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3274.62s)]
*  I think how stupid that is. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3275.14s)]
*  The amount of money they're dealing with, the numbers are so large now. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3277.02s)]
*  I mean, it is like, if you kind of look at like, just say with the NFL or whatever, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3282.46s)]
*  it's like, like not just revenue, but like what it costs to run a team over time. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3287.5s)]
*  Like what it just, it's going so up. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3292.1400000000003s)]
*  There's, there's really no way around it. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3293.54s)]
*  There's no way to, to decrease revenue. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3295.2200000000003s)]
*  Like, like the league can only get bigger. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3301.82s)]
*  They're not like, you know, when they say things are like too big to fail. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3304.1800000000003s)]
*  Some of these leagues are like too big to stop. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3307.1s)]
*  Like they can only have to keep getting larger all the time. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3309.66s)]
*  Well, especially when they're getting giant sale prices and the guys are paying [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3312.94s)]
*  a lot of money and they're like, I want to be, I want to make two times. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3316.14s)]
*  We had to take a break because we have a bunch of other stuff to it. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3319.02s)]
*  What is your highly specific Cooper flag prediction? [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3321.2999999999997s)]
*  So, you know, how, how good do you think he's going to be? [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3325.58s)]
*  I think he's going to be incredible. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3329.74s)]
*  He's been incredible. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3331.46s)]
*  I think he's going to be, I think he has a chance to be somewhere in the [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3332.7s)]
*  Duncan KG vicinity would be his ceiling. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3338.06s)]
*  I think he's going to have a career like that. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3342.82s)]
*  Lift shrimp, that left shrimp. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3346.14s)]
*  Okay. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3349.22s)]
*  Let's hear it be a very good place. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3349.5s)]
*  I think it's going to be a very good player for a lot of years. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3351.34s)]
*  Um, you know, I was shrimp, I think was a, made all NBA once. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3354.1s)]
*  I think it was a 13 on the ones, but if you, if you all started games, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3358.06s)]
*  what I don't know if he's, I don't see him as a dominating player. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3360.54s)]
*  Like, I don't think he's going to, I don't think that I think that he will, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3366.7799999999997s)]
*  uh, be the, you know, the, uh, the second best player on a good, on a [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3369.62s)]
*  great, on a good team or the third best player on a great team. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3375.94s)]
*  So that's what I kind of think. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3378.8599999999997s)]
*  That's the player he's going to end up being. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3379.9s)]
*  I mean, I like him as a player, but I don't, nothing I saw to, to, to me, [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3380.94s)]
*  not that I'm an expert or anything, but made me think like he is going to be. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3385.14s)]
*  Um, you know, unstoppable. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3389.18s)]
*  I think he's just going to be very good. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3391.5s)]
*  And I think KG, even though he doesn't have the same height KG has, I think [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3393.98s)]
*  that's the best comparison because of his competitiveness, which is what [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3398.42s)]
*  he's similar to KG. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3401.42s)]
*  He's just a maniac. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3403.54s)]
*  Like all the guy wants to do is win. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3404.62s)]
*  And like he, every single practice, every drill he's just like KG was. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3406.3s)]
*  He just has to dominate everything. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3410.7400000000002s)]
*  And those guys usually are, are absolutely based in the NBA. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3412.94s)]
*  Tyler Hansborough was like that. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3417.82s)]
*  They call them, but he didn't have the skills, right? [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3419.46s)]
*  So I don't know if the competitiveness alone, I mean, that's a component [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3422.5s)]
*  that's got to be there. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3425.78s)]
*  I mean, how, like it's an interesting question. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3426.9s)]
*  How many, who are great athletes in any sport? [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3430.3s)]
*  Great elite that you would say, not very competitive though. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3434.26s)]
*  I think there's been, who is that? [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3439.66s)]
*  Okay. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3442.3s)]
*  Sure. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3442.66s)]
*  Give me the ones that jump in your mind. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3442.9s)]
*  And you're out of your mind. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3444.1s)]
*  And I'm not going to, because we live in an aggregation universe where that, like [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3445.34s)]
*  I say one name and then it gets thrown out there, you know, the names. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3449.14s)]
*  And there's that there's guys that either had, were the crazy competitors that [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3452.66s)]
*  everybody talked about, or the people that we're constantly disappointed by [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3457.38s)]
*  because it seemed like they're begrudgingly giving a shit or they were always injured [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3460.54s)]
*  or, you know, like there was just a specific difference. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3464.34s)]
*  Give me, it doesn't have to be someone active now. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3468.38s)]
*  I'm like, I'm trying to get, what, what to you as an example of somebody who is [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3470.1s)]
*  a, who you consider elite, you know, in the top tier, but you would say not [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3473.54s)]
*  competitive though, not very competitive. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3478.42s)]
*  But I think all of these guys would be competitive to a certain degree [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3481.14s)]
*  because they get to the NBA, right? [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3484.3399999999997s)]
*  You have to have some sort of level of competitiveness to get to the absolute [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3486.54s)]
*  top level. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3490.5s)]
*  So you're saying you think that flags, that flags competition is like, he's [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3491.2599999999998s)]
*  like, he goes to 11, he's more competitive than the people he plays. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3495.2599999999998s)]
*  I think that's the thing we're a hundred percent positive of. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3498.8599999999997s)]
*  But I, but I also feel like he's an elite, elite, elite defender. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3501.8599999999997s)]
*  Um, he's already like an elite passer. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3507.2599999999998s)]
*  He's just additive and everything he does, everything he does makes other [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3510.58s)]
*  guys better at all times. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3515.2999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3516.7s)]
*  So it's, it's a little similar to how, even though they're completely different, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3517.02s)]
*  but like Halburn is just additive. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3520.06s)]
*  Everything he does is just helps other guys. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3521.98s)]
*  I think he's like that too, but it's more on like the KG side. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3524.74s)]
*  And that was what made KG so great. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3527.2999999999997s)]
*  The KG was like defensive anchor, didn't care if he scored, um, almost like [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3529.3399999999997s)]
*  scored begrudgingly. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3534.34s)]
*  There's a, there's a flag offensive piece where he can potentially be a little [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3536.34s)]
*  tatamy, like you might be able to run him as your point forward. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3540.82s)]
*  He's not as skilled of a score as Tatum was, but he might, you might be able to [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3544.2200000000003s)]
*  run the offense to him at the top, but then have him be your best defensive player. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3547.98s)]
*  And I think that would be the ceiling, like a little KG, little Tatum. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3552.0600000000004s)]
*  I'm not saying he's going to get there, but I think that's the ceiling. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3556.1000000000004s)]
*  He's got physical, great physical attributes, really competitive. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3559.1000000000004s)]
*  What makes him different than say, than Russell Westbrook, a great physical [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3563.02s)]
*  specimen who is extremely competitive and it works extremely hard. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3567.8999999999996s)]
*  That was a big success for Russell Westbrook, right? [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3571.8199999999997s)]
*  The athleticism and the competitiveness. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3573.8999999999996s)]
*  I think what's different with flag is how elite do you classify Westbrook? [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3576.54s)]
*  You like to say, which like when you're ranking guys, where were you [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3580.3399999999997s)]
*  ranking of players of the 21st century? [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3583.22s)]
*  Where do you rank him? [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3586.8599999999997s)]
*  I mean, he's probably one of the best 50 players ever. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3587.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3591.2599999999998s)]
*  But if you were, okay, I'm just curious. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3592.94s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like you mostly talk. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3595.7799999999997s)]
*  I feel like you talk bad about him much more than you talk positively about him. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3598.06s)]
*  That you see, you see his flaws is more defining of him [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3601.8999999999996s)]
*  than his positive attributes. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3604.54s)]
*  Well, I think the issue with Westbrook, if you're going to look at him and you're [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3606.7799999999997s)]
*  comparing him against the greatest players of all time, the guys I had the issue with [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3610.06s)]
*  there is like the situation has to be perfect for them and there's like a lack [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3614.8199999999997s)]
*  of malleability. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3619.62s)]
*  It's like, you know, when he put up his biggest stats and okay, see, it was like, [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3620.58s)]
*  he had the ball all the time. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3624.38s)]
*  He did everything and that was great for him. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3625.42s)]
*  It wasn't necessarily awesome for the team. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3627.74s)]
*  You just had a limited ceiling with that. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3630.06s)]
*  And I always thought there was a push and pull with the rant in some ways. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3631.66s)]
*  I always liked the guys that I feel like can fit into any basketball situation. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3635.46s)]
*  Kobe was the most interesting out of all of these guys, because Kobe always wanted [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3639.5s)]
*  the situation to be the best for him. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3643.38s)]
*  But a lot of times that was the right situation for the team. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3645.42s)]
*  You know, and that's he was, you know, he was he was so talented, most talented [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3648.9s)]
*  player on the floor almost at all times. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3654.58s)]
*  I mean, even even though we was with Shaq, of course, he's got, you know, Shaq [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3656.46s)]
*  matters more for physical reasons, but like he's still the most skilled player. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3660.38s)]
*  Shaq's a really good example for this question you're asking me. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3665.18s)]
*  Now, I was wondering if you were going to mention it. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3668.18s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3669.5s)]
*  Did he was he not competitive enough to you? [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3670.02s)]
*  So Shaq's one of the 15 best players ever. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3673.66s)]
*  I thought he was awesome. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3676.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3678.26s)]
*  If Shaq was wired, like KG was, I'm not sure what happens to the [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3679.5s)]
*  NBA for that entire time. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3683.34s)]
*  Now he probably doesn't play as long. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3684.82s)]
*  Um, but if he was just like, I want to destroy everybody, every game, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3687.02s)]
*  and this is all I care about. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3690.1s)]
*  I do think that was another level he could have gone to. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3693.1s)]
*  I remember writing that Shaq was like the guy who went to college and graduated [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3695.18s)]
*  with a three, seven and had a great time, but probably could have gotten [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3698.82s)]
*  a four Oh, if he really wanted to. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3701.8s)]
*  Um, KG was the guy who graduated with the four Oh. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3703.98s)]
*  you know, KG maximized every single ounce of whatever his career could have been. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3707.94s)]
*  And I think Cooper Flags is going to be like that. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3713.26s)]
*  And I think Duncan was like that too, by the way, the same thing. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3716.62s)]
*  Like Duncan was basically playing on a bum leg for the second half of his career, [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3720.28s)]
*  but Duncan was another one. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3724.62s)]
*  He was just steady. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3725.68s)]
*  He was always there. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3726.46s)]
*  He was completely additive. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3727.78s)]
*  He made everybody better. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3729.14s)]
*  He was an awesome teammate. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3730.18s)]
*  He didn't care about his points. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3731.54s)]
*  Like Flags not going to care what his box store is. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3733.1s)]
*  That became understood over time though. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3735.38s)]
*  I don't think, I mean, I think the initial thing with Duncan, just because of his [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3737.6600000000003s)]
*  demeanor was, is he engaged enough? [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3741.82s)]
*  Is he interested enough? [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3745.26s)]
*  Like just from the way he looked. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3746.86s)]
*  And then, yes, too passive, you know? [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3748.38s)]
*  Um, and then that completely switched and no one thinks that now, you know? [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3750.26s)]
*  Um, well, the Duncan part is, Duncan is definitely a people forget because as [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3754.5s)]
*  the years pass, some guys live on in different ways than other guys. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3760.26s)]
*  We just don't talk about as much, but like Duncan, like annihilated the [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3763.54s)]
*  99 finals. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3767.54s)]
*  He was clearly the best guy in the playoffs that year. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3768.6200000000003s)]
*  Oh, three. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3771.1000000000004s)]
*  He had some really good battles with the Lakers. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3772.1000000000004s)]
*  I think, so we disagree. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3774.6200000000003s)]
*  I think flag's going to be better than you. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3776.06s)]
*  What did you think about the rehearsal? [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3777.86s)]
*  I think he's going to be good, but I don't, yeah, I don't think he's going to be, [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3779.46s)]
*  uh, I, I, I don't know if I, if I, if he will ever, I, I, I'm predicting right [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3783.1400000000003s)]
*  now, he will never win an MVP award. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3788.34s)]
*  He'll never win. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3791.7000000000003s)]
*  He will never be named league MVP. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3792.34s)]
*  I think I would take the bet. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3795.58s)]
*  Okay. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3797.14s)]
*  Okay. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3797.62s)]
*  Uh, you know, there was something unsport related. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3798.98s)]
*  I wanted to ask you about though, which is kind of a weird thing, but I'm just [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3801.54s)]
*  curious, we're not talking about the rehearsal. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3804.34s)]
*  Well, we can talk about that. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3807.38s)]
*  Sure. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3808.14s)]
*  Well, you like the rehearsal. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3808.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3810.82s)]
*  You wanted to talk about it. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3810.98s)]
*  I was excited to talk about the rehearsal. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3812.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3813.94s)]
*  Okay. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3814.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3814.5s)]
*  Let's do it. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3814.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3815.3s)]
*  Um, why did you like it? [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3815.7s)]
*  Well, you know, the whole thing with Nathan Fielder has always been like, what [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3819.86s)]
*  part of this is real and what part of this is fake? [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3826.14s)]
*  Like, if there's like more than anybody else, he kind of pushes this boundary [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3828.22s)]
*  between what is we're actually seeing and what is orchestrated. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3832.42s)]
*  And I would not have thought he could have leveled that up, but this last season [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3836.02s)]
*  of the rehearsal, I've never seen something where I am so unclear about [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3839.8599999999997s)]
*  what parts are real and what parts are fake. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3845.66s)]
*  I have no sense of it. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3848.42s)]
*  It could be 98% real. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3850.5s)]
*  It could be 4% real. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3853.58s)]
*  And, you know, so he's, so he's really funny. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3856.1s)]
*  He finds ways to be funny in situations that you wouldn't normally see that. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3857.98s)]
*  But there's also like an appreciation for the execution of what he's doing. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3861.2599999999998s)]
*  I, it just, it seems like he's working differently than everybody else who does [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3866.62s)]
*  this, you know, and a lot differently, not like he's taken something other people [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3870.98s)]
*  done and, and sort of, you know, twisted or morphed it, like he's doing something [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3875.2599999999998s)]
*  that I don't, I don't even know what the analogy is. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3879.38s)]
*  The thing about the rehearsal that's so interesting, maybe you've experienced [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3881.74s)]
*  this, have you ever tried to describe it to someone who's never heard of it? [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3885.02s)]
*  You will sound like a fucking crazy person, but trying to describe what you're [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3888.86s)]
*  watching, just somebody who doesn't know what it is, it just sounds, you hear [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3893.86s)]
*  yourself saying things that make it seem like you're on LSD. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3898.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3901.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3903.2599999999998s)]
*  So for the people listening to this, who didn't see the rehearsal, let's do that. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3903.74s)]
*  I'll do the exercise right now. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3908.98s)]
*  Um, the season starts out with Nathan Fielder being obsessed with pilot [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3910.82s)]
*  communication and a theory that plane crashes happen partly because the pilot [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3915.78s)]
*  and the co-pilot don't spend enough time trying to connect as partners the same [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3922.5400000000004s)]
*  way you would in like basketball or other things and goes on this deep dive to try [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3927.1000000000004s)]
*  to prove his point starts rehearsing pilot interactions, um, goes backwards, [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3932.38s)]
*  recreates the solely plane crash and it's all leading toward you think he's going [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3938.34s)]
*  to actually just have two of these pilots that he basically rehearses together. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3944.5800000000004s)]
*  So they have chemistry fly some sort of crazy mission. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3948.9s)]
*  And then the twist is he's been taking pilot lessons the whole time and he's [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3953.34s)]
*  going to fly a seven 37 with this guy that he's handpicked throughout a couple [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3958.54s)]
*  episodes and they're going to fly a seven 37 together. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3963.3s)]
*  So the season finale is all of a sudden he's a licensed commercial jet pilot. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3967.18s)]
*  Is that, is that, did, did I describe that correctly? [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3973.4199999999996s)]
*  I mean, yes, everything you said is true, but even like, I don't even think [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3975.98s)]
*  that goes far enough. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3978.98s)]
*  First of all, what I always tell people if they've never seen this is I do feel [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3979.8199999999997s)]
*  you need to watch the first two episodes of the first season, you necessarily have [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3983.8599999999997s)]
*  to watch the whole season, but you definitely do like the first two episodes [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3988.2999999999997s)]
*  because he is basing everything off the premise that everything in life would be [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3991.7799999999997s)]
*  easier if you could rehearse every day to day moment of your life through the [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=3997.34s)]
*  highest possible simulation, which is like, and when you say that to someone, [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4002.66s)]
*  they're like, well, what does that mean? [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4007.62s)]
*  I'd be like, well, are you going to have lunch today at a diner? [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4009.38s)]
*  Would it be easier if we built a diner that you could then go into and talk to [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4013.9s)]
*  an actor who will tend to be the waiter? [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4018.74s)]
*  Like it's like, well, how does that make sense? [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4020.7s)]
*  Well, in some strange way it does because it's sort of tapping into this idea of [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4022.34s)]
*  what parts of life are real and what parts of life are unreal. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4030.06s)]
*  And, you know, like when you give you an argument with anybody about anything, [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4033.2999999999997s)]
*  what's, you know, big picture stuff, what will they often say? [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4036.14s)]
*  Oh, that thing you're, you're, you're describing or the thing you're promoting, [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4039.14s)]
*  uh, that thing you believe in, that's just a construct, right? [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4043.14s)]
*  They'll be like, that's a construct. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4046.7s)]
*  That's not real. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4047.98s)]
*  And what his sort of theory of entertainment is, is that it's almost all a construct. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4049.1s)]
*  Everything that we do is a construct and the fact that it's constructed [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4055.66s)]
*  doesn't make it less authentic. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4059.3s)]
*  So then he's a comedian who decides, is it possible that a comedian could have [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4061.38s)]
*  real change in the world in a good way, despite the fact that people can't take [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4066.7s)]
*  him seriously because he's always joking. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4071.22s)]
*  That's how the season begins. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4073.5s)]
*  Then the season moves into this idea that he's obsessed with plane crashes, [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4075.5s)]
*  seemingly for real, particularly black box recordings. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4079.7s)]
*  And it's come to the conclusion that the real issue is that pilots and co-pilots [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4083.82s)]
*  do not have enough interpersonal interaction. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4088.5s)]
*  Maybe it would be better if we made them do a play before every flight where they [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4090.74s)]
*  discuss their freedom of knowledge and their willingness to hear other things. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4097.46s)]
*  And he's flying a 737 for real, filled with actors, which he couldn't do if they [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4102.74s)]
*  were just people, but because he's paying them as actors, he can fly these people [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4108.259999999999s)]
*  in the same way it's illegal to pay someone to have sex with you unless you [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4112.82s)]
*  film it and it becomes pornography. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4116.62s)]
*  I feel like that idea is brought into it. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4118.259999999999s)]
*  There's also the aspect in this show at the very end where he's kind of like, [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4120.58s)]
*  well, I got to go back into this. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4124.66s)]
*  There's also a point in the show where he deals with the possibility, the [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4127.66s)]
*  accusation that he has autism and his belief that he does not. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4131.34s)]
*  And that, in fact, his artistic qualities are, I forgot that are human nature, [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4136.22s)]
*  that everyone thinks about this just like him. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4141.46s)]
*  And then at the end, when he flies the plane, he's like, well, OK, so if you're [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4144.42s)]
*  autistic, they wouldn't let you fly this plane. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4148.1s)]
*  So because I managed to get into a situation where I can fly the plane, that [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4151.46s)]
*  proves I'm not autistic. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4155.7s)]
*  I really think and maybe this has been written about a thousand places. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4158.0199999999995s)]
*  I think this season was like an homage to Catch 22, the book Catch 22. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4161.54s)]
*  Are you familiar with that? Yeah. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4167.46s)]
*  It's sort of like in Catch 22, the whole idea is that there are these fighter [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4168.9s)]
*  pilots and the belief is that you can only be a fighter pilot if you're kind of [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4172.46s)]
*  insane. So to prove that you can't be a fighter pilot, [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4181.179999999999s)]
*  you can't do it by becoming crazy because that validates your ability. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4186.179999999999s)]
*  It's like where the phrase Catch 22 comes from. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4191.78s)]
*  Right. And I think that that's what was tied into this. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4193.58s)]
*  That like if you if you listen to the end of that, that last episode, he's [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4197.259999999999s)]
*  basically saying the fact that he flew this plane full of actors when he wasn't [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4201.82s)]
*  qualified is proof that he was qualified. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4206.38s)]
*  And that's a real complicated idea when you really think about it. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4209.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And then the last piece of that would be this is why we have plane [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4212.78s)]
*  accidents every once in a while, because we do not put any real thought into who [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4217.82s)]
*  gets to be a pilot and who gets not to be a pilot. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4222.86s)]
*  It just comes down to how many hours you flew. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4224.82s)]
*  Well, and also it was amazing to realize you can become a 737 pilot without [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4227.5s)]
*  actually flying the plane. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4232.219999999999s)]
*  You can just just put the hours in and you could somehow get there and you have [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4233.46s)]
*  to take a test and be like, no, I'm not autistic and all the other things that he [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4237.66s)]
*  points out. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4241.18s)]
*  But the other thing that's like, so he becomes a real pilot, right. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4241.9400000000005s)]
*  And we see all this footage of him learning this. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4244.820000000001s)]
*  So when did he start this? [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4247.26s)]
*  Did he start this before? [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4248.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he started. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4251.1s)]
*  So he started first rehearsal. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4252.38s)]
*  Like how many years has he been doing this? [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4254.3s)]
*  Apparently at least two where he started taking lessons and stuff, because that [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4257.42s)]
*  was in some of the some of the writing about the series after it finished, where [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4264.22s)]
*  they were talking about. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4268.780000000001s)]
*  Apparently there was a Reddit thing where people realized that he was taking [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4269.78s)]
*  pilot lessons and there was this theory that the last episode was going to be [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4275.22s)]
*  him flying because they had seen they because you can track all this stuff. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4279.099999999999s)]
*  So I think it had been like two years. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4283.3s)]
*  There's also an interesting aspect that he does something that you don't normally [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4285.14s)]
*  see on television shows. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4287.98s)]
*  He starts talking about problems he had making a different TV show, the curse for [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4289.94s)]
*  a different network and how it was removed from streaming service because it [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4294.38s)]
*  was seen as being anti-semitic. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4299.46s)]
*  It was an episode they removed because it was anti-semitic allegedly. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4302.7s)]
*  So then he, well, but it was, it was, it was considered anti-semitic because it [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4305.86s)]
*  was just like, I guess, length, like I don't, I don't, it seems to be opposite. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4310.1s)]
*  So then he simulates him going to talk to a guy in Germany, which he imagines to be [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4314.1s)]
*  in the city, you know, then the guy who was simulating the German that says like, [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4320.38s)]
*  this is now it is like, there's, there are things that happen in every one of these [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4323.9800000000005s)]
*  episodes that I, I was like, I, I, there's no comparison to this and anything I've [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4328.46s)]
*  seen before. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4334.22s)]
*  And I don't know how I feel about it. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4335.5s)]
*  Like, like there are, uh, he, he does seem to be a rare thing, which is a [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4337.74s)]
*  completely amoral Canadian. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4343.62s)]
*  Like he seems to, he doesn't seem to have like, like he, you know, and, and I guess [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4346.66s)]
*  and, you know, like, like in, in some ways, I guess I sort of relate to this. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4354.98s)]
*  So we talking about ideas and you can sense that the question around that idea is you, [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4360.139999999999s)]
*  should you even be doing this? [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4365.5s)]
*  Like, should you be having another aspect of this show? [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4367.38s)]
*  He creates a full singing competition, like a, like a, you know, like the voice or [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4370.74s)]
*  whatever, except the people judging the singers are all airline pilots because he [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4375.98s)]
*  needs to teach the airline pilots how to give constructive criticism. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4383.66s)]
*  Like they did all these weird things. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4387.9s)]
*  It's like, so he's manipulating all, most of the people involved in this are kind of, [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4389.34s)]
*  I think being willfully manipulated, like they gotta know something is going on and [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4393.98s)]
*  they want to be involved anyways. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4398.98s)]
*  Um, it is, there's just, I mean, I, I, I, I seem like I'm just like maybe being too [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4400.62s)]
*  rhapsodic about this, but I really do think like, I, if somebody said to me, it's [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4409.42s)]
*  like, boy, I want, I want to see something that's really good and really interesting. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4412.9400000000005s)]
*  And it's gonna not what I've seen before. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4416.9800000000005s)]
*  Like this is it. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4419.26s)]
*  I, I, I, I'm trying to think of what a TV show prior to this. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4421.34s)]
*  And you know, when he did the curse, that was a narrative show that also did things [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4426.86s)]
*  I had not really seen in television before. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4430.86s)]
*  I mean, his, his level of innovation and true creativity is just kind of off the [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4432.86s)]
*  scale. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4438.46s)]
*  And, you know, it's like, there's a lot of people who know the form of creativity. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4439.3s)]
*  They do creative things because they know what people will anticipate and will see [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4443.02s)]
*  as creative. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4447.02s)]
*  He is not like that. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4447.78s)]
*  Like the things he is doing, he is doing for the first time. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4449.18s)]
*  Well, it makes me think of how people, and I was a kid. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4453.66s)]
*  I remember Andy Kaufman, some of the stuff he would do and how people would talk about [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4456.94s)]
*  it. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4460.94s)]
*  That, and it got to the point when he died, people were convinced that he faked his own [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4461.18s)]
*  death and that was like his big grand thing. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4464.22s)]
*  So I'm sure Nathan's been influenced by him a little bit, just how people perceived [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4466.9s)]
*  him. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4472.62s)]
*  But the way he's taken, the way he took this last season, I thought the first season [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4473.26s)]
*  of the rehearsal was amazing. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4477.94s)]
*  And it was just like, I've never seen anything like this. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4480.139999999999s)]
*  Last season went a whole other level beyond that. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4482.62s)]
*  The first season clearly did get fucked up by the pandemic. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4485.34s)]
*  I feel like that they had to do, like there were some things that would have happened [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4488.62s)]
*  in that season that just became impossible. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4492.3s)]
*  Because I feel like it was shot during the heart of that, like when it was really hard [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4494.98s)]
*  to do anything. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4499.139999999999s)]
*  The Andy Kaufman thing, yes, I'm sure in a way, but I happen to just watch a, I've [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4501.94s)]
*  seen a bunch of Andy Kaufman documentaries. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4508.0199999999995s)]
*  There's one I saw just recently on Canopy or whatever. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4509.7s)]
*  And the thing that about him, though, that was like, there was a degree, in my opinion, [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4512.86s)]
*  of real kind of self-indulgence to what Andy Kaufman was doing in the sense that it [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4522.1s)]
*  really wasn't for anyone but himself, which as an artist, I know people do, but I'm [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4527.06s)]
*  just, I'm not even saying this is a huge criticism. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4531.02s)]
*  There was something where it was like the only person who could be amused by this is [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4533.14s)]
*  himself or someone watching it years later and realize that like, this is crazy that [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4538.740000000001s)]
*  this happened. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4545.46s)]
*  With Nathan Fielder, it is a little different because I find his motives and his [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4546.54s)]
*  intentions more confusing. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4553.46s)]
*  Like I don't, I can't necessarily say he's doing this just to please himself. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4556.38s)]
*  I do think there's a possibility that he actually does think that he can stop airline [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4563.26s)]
*  crashes. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4568.780000000001s)]
*  And he was like, but the only way I can do this is by using my platform as a comedian. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4569.740000000001s)]
*  So I have to first convince people that, you know, that a comedian should be taken. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4575.299999999999s)]
*  I don't even know. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4583.5s)]
*  I like, I don't even know how to describe it. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4584.58s)]
*  I thought you, you left out one other piece too, is that he loves when anything gets [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4586.54s)]
*  uncomfortable. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4591.74s)]
*  It was like his, his all time sweet spot. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4592.379999999999s)]
*  So on top of all this big picture stuff that he's doing and all these big themes he's [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4595.339999999999s)]
*  hitting just fundamentally the best part of his show, it seems like for him is when it [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4598.98s)]
*  can get super awkward with somebody like when he's asking that pilot who obviously [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4604.34s)]
*  didn't have a lot of luck with the ladies and the guys giving him information and you [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4609.74s)]
*  could just see like something shifts with him where he's, it just becomes the most [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4614.74s)]
*  interesting conversation he's ever had. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4618.66s)]
*  I don't, yeah. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4621.66s)]
*  It's like what you're saying is true because it's like this. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4623.18s)]
*  It's like a guy who's blind has an advantage in darkness, right? [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4625.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4630.58s)]
*  I was uncomfortable all the time has the advantage when everything else becomes [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4631.179999999999s)]
*  uncomfortable. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4636.94s)]
*  So the more the stranger, the situ because his personality never changes. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4637.86s)]
*  Like his, he remains the same for the totality of everything he does. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4643.179999999999s)]
*  It doesn't matter if he's doing something boring and there are stretches in the show [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4648.099999999999s)]
*  that are boring. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4651.82s)]
*  There will be a five or 10 minute stretch where it's like, I wonder if this is going [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4652.86s)]
*  to be a bad episode. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4656.38s)]
*  Then a lot of times it'll come back at the end. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4657.299999999999s)]
*  So like discomfort is where he is most comfortable. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4659.3s)]
*  Well, it'd be great if he was like, he would be the greatest NBA sideline reporter of [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4663.38s)]
*  all time. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4668.06s)]
*  Like, come back, let's go to Nathan Fielder. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4671.5s)]
*  He's with Rick Carlisle and he just completely makes Rick Carlisle uncomfortable. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4675.06s)]
*  I did, I think I did the first podcast with him when I was at Grantland. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4680.1s)]
*  Um, or one of the first ones and trying to interview him was like trying to, uh, I [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4684.62s)]
*  don't know, write a, write a bull or something, you know, and he's, he both knew [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4690.26s)]
*  it was a good thing to the podcast. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4695.26s)]
*  I think he liked me, but he's just, his default is he likes when it's [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4696.46s)]
*  uncomfortable, right? [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4702.66s)]
*  So it's a podcast and we're talking and he's a little uncomfortable anyway. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4703.62s)]
*  And it was just a weird of the podcast get, you could just see like the twinkle in [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4707.86s)]
*  his eye every time something would happen. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4711.54s)]
*  I was like, Oh, this is the, those are the most fun people to interview. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4713.74s)]
*  Sort of. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4718.18s)]
*  And it's also kind of an impossible interview in a sense, because why do people [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4718.58s)]
*  go on, like why do people listen to celebrities on podcasts? [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4722.46s)]
*  Why do people read New Yorker profiles of people or, you know, Rolling Stone [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4725.34s)]
*  profiles of people? [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4728.66s)]
*  You're like, who is this person for real? [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4729.74s)]
*  Okay. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4731.9800000000005s)]
*  And he doesn't do that. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4732.22s)]
*  No, he's never going to do that. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4733.82s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4735.34s)]
*  So when he is on your podcast, that is the same as when he's on his show. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4736.339999999999s)]
*  I don't think that there is, um, like, uh, I can't imagine a scenario. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4742.139999999999s)]
*  Like I think if, if, if I interviewed him, I think it would be a disaster because [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4747.86s)]
*  my whole thing is always whenever I interviewed people is like, well, I want [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4753.42s)]
*  to try to get something from this person that they, that, that will kind of show [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4756.78s)]
*  sort of a reality about them, that you can't get through their art. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4761.94s)]
*  That this is who they actually are and this is what they do. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4765.7s)]
*  And I have no idea how I would do that with him. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4768.7s)]
*  I have no idea what I would ask him or talk to him to, to, to convince him that, [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4770.7s)]
*  uh, what I'm trying to find out is what is behind the thing he's ostensibly doing. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4775.78s)]
*  Because what's behind the things he's ostensibly doing is ostensibly the same. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4780.58s)]
*  I did a thing, you know, those for your consideration where they show the [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4784.9s)]
*  episode to a bunch of Emmy people. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4788.3s)]
*  Like they'll go, they'll run out of theater and they show it and then [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4791.22s)]
*  they interview the person after. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4793.82s)]
*  So I did that with him a couple of years ago for, I think it was [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4795.7s)]
*  the first season of the rehearsal. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4798.9s)]
*  We showed the episode and you know, all these people there and he just, he's [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4800.42s)]
*  just not going to do that typically. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4805.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4807.9400000000005s)]
*  So his whole thing was to make him uncomfortable. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4808.3s)]
*  We brought the guy out who was the one of the stars from the first season. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4810.18s)]
*  And that guy came out and it was just, he just wanted it to be as awkward as possible. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4814.46s)]
*  And it was like, perfect. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4819.9s)]
*  It was exactly what you would have thought would have happened. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4821.02s)]
*  I just think that's how he's wired. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4823.34s)]
*  I thought Nathan for you, the Comedy Central show he did, I thought he really [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4825.179999999999s)]
*  started to figure that show out, especially the last season, um, and took a lot of [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4829.139999999999s)]
*  those kind of breadcrumbs from that show and just moved them into this. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4834.54s)]
*  Now it's like, I don't even know what I want them to do for the next season. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4838.099999999999s)]
*  I got to imagine HBO is thrilled. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4842.139999999999s)]
*  It's like the perfect HBO show. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4843.9s)]
*  It's so fucking weird. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4845.34s)]
*  It's so great. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4846.46s)]
*  It's like such genius. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4847.22s)]
*  You know what I, you, we should interview, interview the guy who greenlit this and [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4848.94s)]
*  ask him, what the fuck did he tell you in your office? [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4854.1s)]
*  Do this? [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4857.34s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4858.46s)]
*  I'm serious because the budget for this is insane. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4858.900000000001s)]
*  Like what is this in this season when he goes out and has to buy a 7 37 and he's [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4862.34s)]
*  actually looking for like a bargain 7 37 and going to these actual places. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4866.700000000001s)]
*  Like, I can't imagine how this, if I can't describe it to someone who I'm [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4871.9800000000005s)]
*  trying to convince to watch it, how do you describe it to someone to pay for it? [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4877.18s)]
*  I just have no idea. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4880.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4882.5s)]
*  What would be your, what would be your number one draft pick for the next [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4882.780000000001s)]
*  rehearsal season for him to dive into? [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4886.9800000000005s)]
*  I, well, I mean, this is a real lame answer, but like, I want him to just do [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4890.700000000001s)]
*  what he does. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4894.1s)]
*  I want him to just follow what he's doing. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4894.62s)]
*  Like, cause there's no way, there's no way I could have predicted this. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4896.26s)]
*  Like there's no way I could have advised him to do this. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4900.02s)]
*  I just, I think that what he, he is after something. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4902.62s)]
*  He is after some idea. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4906.860000000001s)]
*  I mean, maybe I'm giving him too much credit. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4909.02s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4910.42s)]
*  I don't think you are. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4911.1s)]
*  I feel like he is after something that, I mean, in some ways might spend my whole [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4911.74s)]
*  life. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4918.66s)]
*  This question is like, what is real? [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4919.38s)]
*  Like what parts of existence are real? [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4922.26s)]
*  I mean, you've heard a whole book about this once. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4924.82s)]
*  Well, they're all about that. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4927.099999999999s)]
*  They're all about that in a way. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4929.34s)]
*  There's something else I want to ask you about though, that that's, that's not [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4930.62s)]
*  related to this, but I, I just, I feel like you'll have an interesting response. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4932.9s)]
*  Okay. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4936.5s)]
*  So, so, you know, it was, it was 90 degrees here in Portland. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4937.42s)]
*  So it's Portland said, let's school out. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4941.74s)]
*  Okay. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4943.78s)]
*  We can't have school. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4943.98s)]
*  It's nine degrees. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4945.0199999999995s)]
*  So, so after you got something, you got nothing to do my kids home or whatever. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4945.74s)]
*  Um, so, uh, we watched cool hand Luke, you know, which I've watched probably 10 [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4949.179999999999s)]
*  times in my life or 15 times in my life. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4954.54s)]
*  One of my favorite, you know, okay. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4956.0199999999995s)]
*  So that movie was made in 1967. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4957.82s)]
*  And, uh, I've also been a couple songs that I've been listening to a lot lately [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4960.46s)]
*  is the song jailbreak by a jailbreak, which I had 76 or 77 escape from Alcatraz. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4968.74s)]
*  I think it was like 1979 ish to maybe 1980 or whatever. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4974.42s)]
*  So there was this period of time when there was a lot of art about the idea [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4978.78s)]
*  of breaking out of jail, right? [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4983.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4984.82s)]
*  Um, and there are still people who break out of jail. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4985.58s)]
*  There was like guys who broke out of jail recently in New Orleans. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4988.1s)]
*  And one guy immediately makes a tick tock of himself out of jail or whatever. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4990.620000000001s)]
*  I saw that I was reading about this guy in Arkansas, a former [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4993.740000000001s)]
*  cop who broke out of jail. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4996.820000000001s)]
*  He got caught like a day and a half later. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=4998.620000000001s)]
*  And what I was thinking about is so prior to the internet and prior to like network [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5000.780000000001s)]
*  computing, if you broke out of jail, could you just never get caught and go into [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5006.14s)]
*  society and is that completely impossible? [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5013.18s)]
*  Now, if someone broke out of jail, now could they ever in any way sort of become [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5016.1s)]
*  just like a sit because you know, in the past, if there was like, if you got out [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5023.660000000001s)]
*  of jail in Georgia and you got to Kansas or whatever, well, how would they, unless [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5028.06s)]
*  you were like just a murder that the entire country was looking for, if you [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5033.58s)]
*  were just like somebody who was arrested for cutting the heads off of, you know, [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5036.860000000001s)]
*  a meter or whatever, it's like, there would be no, how would they even know [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5042.34s)]
*  you're there? [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5046.86s)]
*  How would they like, you know, you used to be able to get an apartment. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5047.66s)]
*  You didn't even need ID. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5051.26s)]
*  I think at my first apartment I got in 1994, I don't think I showed them my idea. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5052.38s)]
*  I think I just wrote my number down. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5056.98s)]
*  Um, what you do now, if someone escapes from, if you escaped from prison, what [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5058.82s)]
*  would you do? [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5064.9s)]
*  Incredible questions. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5067.46s)]
*  Um, and I followed the new Orleans thing very closely. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5068.7s)]
*  It was my kind of story. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5071.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5073.54s)]
*  There was even, there was betting odds about which guy just based on the mug [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5073.82s)]
*  shots, which guy was going to make it the longest. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5079.139999999999s)]
*  And I think the consensus when, when people looked at the pictures, that guy [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5081.86s)]
*  actually did make it the longest. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5085.26s)]
*  But, um, so I think the heyday for this would have been the seventies. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5086.54s)]
*  I think when Bundy broke out of the Colorado jail and was somehow able to [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5091.94s)]
*  make it cross country, that was the heyday for a lot of bad behavior. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5095.38s)]
*  Um, cause we didn't have any cameras. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5099.099999999999s)]
*  He could just kind of move around and nobody could ever find you. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5101.34s)]
*  I think the cameras would make it really hard now. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5105.0199999999995s)]
*  And facial, it feels like there's cameras every year, facial recognition [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5107.78s)]
*  cameras, like the moment, like those New Orleans guys, they move out of there. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5111.139999999999s)]
*  And you're either going, yeah, I guess the goal would be to go to Mexico. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5115.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5120.94s)]
*  You want to get out of America, right? [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5121.34s)]
*  I mean, yeah, it would be hard with like the getting to Canada. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5123.66s)]
*  Now would be pretty hard, but even if you, I mean, so you're, so if you, like, [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5128.42s)]
*  let's, if you just escape and you go to a different city, but your name is [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5133.7s)]
*  in the FBI database, you are an escaped prisoner, your mugshot can be called up [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5138.7s)]
*  anywhere if you get pulled over by, by a state trooper, I mean, it's very [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5143.7s)]
*  possible that he could be, so what, [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5148.22s)]
*  you can't get pulled over anywhere. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5150.78s)]
*  You're basically better off. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5152.18s)]
*  I mean, do you want like the terrible answer? [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5155.9800000000005s)]
*  What's the terrible answer? [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5158.259999999999s)]
*  You're probably better off finding somebody's house that has a super old [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5160.259999999999s)]
*  person living by themselves and probably have to commit another crime, take over [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5164.3s)]
*  that house and you have about two weeks there to like get, to really plan out. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5170.3s)]
*  Whatever you're saying. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5175.62s)]
*  Person you eliminate has no kids. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5178.74s)]
*  I mean, I guess she's coming here in good shape because kids don't talk, but [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5182.0599999999995s)]
*  if it's like, like if, if someone had taken over, my parents are dead now, but [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5185.42s)]
*  if somebody had taken over my mom's house, like that would have, that would [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5188.74s)]
*  have been deduced very quickly. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5192.02s)]
*  No. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5194.7s)]
*  So maybe of like three, four days, right before people are like, ah, I called [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5194.86s)]
*  dad and nobody answered and now I'm starting to get word it's been four days. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5198.900000000001s)]
*  So maybe a four days. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5203.18s)]
*  Let's say you find the old person. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5205.26s)]
*  And my point is, I don't think you can be in the streets for the week. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5207.26s)]
*  I think you have to find some sort of a roof where you can kind of plan [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5211.14s)]
*  what your next thing is. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5215.900000000001s)]
*  You probably need a car. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5216.9400000000005s)]
*  Maybe you need to like switch the license plates. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5218.34s)]
*  And I think you want to go toward a place that doesn't have a lot of people. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5221.26s)]
*  So maybe you want to go like middle America. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5226.22s)]
*  You want to go like Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5228.22s)]
*  Like that should be your ultimate goal is once I get there, now I can, there's [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5231.38s)]
*  less people I can kind of move around. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5234.860000000001s)]
*  Maybe I find some new house that I could, I could, you know, maybe I could scout [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5237.26s)]
*  a house and doesn't seem like a lot of action. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5242.38s)]
*  Maybe, maybe it's somebody's winter house that they don't even use and [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5244.9s)]
*  just kind of bounce around. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5248.82s)]
*  You're going to get caught eventually though is the point. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5250.099999999999s)]
*  Well, that's the thing you would say that it is virtually impossible for someone [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5252.0199999999995s)]
*  to escape from jail or prison and completely just disappear. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5256.46s)]
*  Now, I think you get caught within a year. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5260.3s)]
*  I don't think there's any way to not get caught unless you left the country and [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5262.22s)]
*  went, once you go down, I think once you go to Mexico, that area, I think maybe [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5267.66s)]
*  a better chance, right? [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5271.820000000001s)]
*  Wouldn't the move be, what would your move be? [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5273.780000000001s)]
*  You didn't tell me. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5276.860000000001s)]
*  Well, I'm here killing old people and you're not even saying anything. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5278.58s)]
*  I, I, I would think that the, the thing you would need to do is to find a [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5282.900000000001s)]
*  sympathetic second person, either someone you could convince to start dating you, [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5291.9s)]
*  you know, and live to live with or, [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5298.46s)]
*  Oh, right. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5301.379999999999s)]
*  To be like your, your co-conspirator. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5301.82s)]
*  Well, somebody who can be like, I can get you food. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5304.259999999999s)]
*  I can go and do these things for you, you know, but at some point you're [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5306.78s)]
*  going to have to try to integrate back into society. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5310.0599999999995s)]
*  And I wonder with now with network computing, if that kind of, like, you [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5314.42s)]
*  know, people go off the grid, but let's, you can escape the, you know, you could, [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5319.34s)]
*  you could escape from all that, I guess. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5324.34s)]
*  And, and, you know, but then it's like, do you want to escape from prison to [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5326.46s)]
*  live in Ted Kaczynski's cabin? [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5329.860000000001s)]
*  You know, you, if you're getting out of prison, you know, it's, it's what's [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5331.78s)]
*  like in that ACDC song, this thing is like, I'm not spending my life here. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5334.78s)]
*  I'm not living alone. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5338.26s)]
*  It's like he wants to find someone to be with. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5339.5s)]
*  So you would, your desire would be to get back to the world, but can the world [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5342.34s)]
*  no longer be, can you, can you no longer reenter the world as a different person? [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5346.86s)]
*  Well, you're talking with people that probably have committed major crimes and [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5352.58s)]
*  aren't dealing with a full deck to begin with, but I think it's a good point about [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5356.0199999999995s)]
*  needing somebody on the outside. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5361.299999999999s)]
*  So maybe if you escape, you have to know somebody's waiting on the other end, [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5363.82s)]
*  then, then now be your accomplice. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5367.219999999999s)]
*  That's why I escaped for escape from Dana Mora was such a good show. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5368.7s)]
*  Cause it was like, fundamentally they had good ideas, right? [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5372.5s)]
*  They had the prison guard. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5375.62s)]
*  Um, they were going to go, they, they, they knew their route. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5377.34s)]
*  They were going in like a pretty unpopulated place and be able to go and try [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5380.42s)]
*  to get to Canada and then it went haywire. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5384.42s)]
*  But even then they almost made it. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5386.66s)]
*  You know, they were out there for days and days. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5389.18s)]
*  Nobody could find them. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5391.5s)]
*  So I think that when you go to the, like those more remote places, you probably [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5393.0199999999995s)]
*  have a better chance, as long as it's not cold, like too cold. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5396.38s)]
*  There's so much like, you know, songs and films and TV shows from like the [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5400.58s)]
*  sixties and seventies about breaking out of jail. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5404.3s)]
*  I just gave a bunch of examples of it. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5406.22s)]
*  Like, uh, were there lots of escaped prisoners in America in the forties and [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5407.860000000001s)]
*  fifties, like some guy breaks that, you know, gets off of chain gang, you know, [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5413.02s)]
*  I'm a fugitive from a chain gang or whatever, but there's no, like, when I say [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5416.58s)]
*  like, there's no paper trail, it's because paper would have been the only possible [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5422.14s)]
*  trail, a piece of paper saying that you got sent to jail. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5425.54s)]
*  That's like the, what else is there? [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5428.9800000000005s)]
*  Like there, you know, there's, they, they can't send your photograph or [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5430.58s)]
*  your mugshot or a wanted poster to every post office in the United States. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5434.06s)]
*  And it's like, it seems like in the past, there would have been a real sort of [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5438.22s)]
*  incentive to try to break out of jail. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5443.9800000000005s)]
*  It might work. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5445.700000000001s)]
*  It could work well, but I don't think it's possible. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5446.740000000001s)]
*  Well, how do you watch Shawshank now knowing all the current technology? [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5449.54s)]
*  Cause Shawshank think about like he escapes that prison, I think was in [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5454.1s)]
*  Maine in the movie and he's got to go from Maine to Texas and then cross the [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5457.22s)]
*  border to get to Mexico and in 2025, he's just getting caught within, I don't know. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5463.26s)]
*  First of all, he's not pulling off really any of the stuff he pulled. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5470.26s)]
*  He's not going to 12 banks and taking out all the money. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5472.54s)]
*  They just would have caught him almost immediately. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5474.9800000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5477.3s)]
*  This would have been a huge manhunt in 1968, whatever. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5477.780000000001s)]
*  Maybe, maybe easier to do. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5482.9800000000005s)]
*  I haven't seen that movie since it came out. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5485.06s)]
*  What is this? [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5486.900000000001s)]
*  What is he accused of? [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5487.42s)]
*  I can't remember. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5489.02s)]
*  He's falsely accused of murder. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5490.02s)]
*  He's accused of murdering his wife, but he'd do it. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5491.82s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5494.1s)]
*  Now, well, that's real crime. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5494.7s)]
*  I guess they might be interested in that. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5496.18s)]
*  Uh, yeah, I, uh, I just sort of remember him kind of working out kind of a [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5498.3s)]
*  pretty good life in prison and I was like helping guys in popular didn't, [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5503.54s)]
*  you know, worked it had to get out. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5507.34s)]
*  He, they killed it. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5509.22s)]
*  They killed his favorite guy. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5510.0599999999995s)]
*  He ended up in Mexico. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5511.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5512.5s)]
*  I don't think that you're not getting on the bus now. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5512.7s)]
*  Like, I just think they would catch you. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5515.26s)]
*  So, so you think at our lifetime, will somebody escape from prison [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5518.18s)]
*  and never be seen again? [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5524.02s)]
*  I mean, I don't like from this moment forward. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5526.9400000000005s)]
*  Uh, well, uh, I mean, I think that we, that, I mean, ever since everything [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5529.660000000001s)]
*  happens now, something that could, it could happen, I guess somehow, but it [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5535.740000000001s)]
*  seems just impossible to me. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5539.14s)]
*  Like, I don't know how it would be done in the United States. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5540.54s)]
*  Maybe they would be able to track their Google usage. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5543.26s)]
*  Like they'd have all kinds of tricks. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5546.18s)]
*  Even if they can't catch you, it's like, you have to reenter the world. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5548.219999999999s)]
*  And it's like, that's the hard thing. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5552.62s)]
*  It's like you, like you, uh, um, it would be very difficult to live a [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5554.34s)]
*  quiet life that doesn't require you to like, show your ID for something, show [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5560.099999999999s)]
*  your, your driver's license, your passport or something like, like you to [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5565.86s)]
*  get a, to even get like a, I mean, I think there used to be, it would have [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5569.58s)]
*  been possible, maybe you go somewhere and it's like, there's day laborers. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5574.0599999999995s)]
*  They pay you in cash. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5577.18s)]
*  You can get a job. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5578.14s)]
*  You know, I don't think there's anything like that. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5579.22s)]
*  Well, now they have real ID for flying. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5581.06s)]
*  Like you, it's even harder to just fly compared to 30 years ago. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5583.1s)]
*  You just hop out of plane. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5586.26s)]
*  Well, you're somebody going to give you a ticket and be like, yeah, here's my plane. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5587.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5590.9800000000005s)]
*  I go to the DMV and like wait four hours to get that or whatever. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5591.1s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5594.18s)]
*  It seems just like my normal ID, except there's a star on it now or something. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5594.46s)]
*  But we have to wrap up. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5598.34s)]
*  Do you have any generalized AI fears before we go? [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5599.9800000000005s)]
*  Uh, well, many. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5604.700000000001s)]
*  Many AI fears. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5607.0199999999995s)]
*  Um, you know, I can't think of many other examples of something where almost [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5608.98s)]
*  everybody who understands it seems to believe it could have incredibly [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5615.54s)]
*  catastrophic like outcomes and yet we just keep going on it. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5621.82s)]
*  I mean, even like the atomic age and the nuclear age and stuff, it was like, [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5626.98s)]
*  we're doing this against our will. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5630.46s)]
*  Like if Russia wasn't doing this, but like everybody, everybody seems to [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5632.099999999999s)]
*  understand like, um, I got for the times Ross Dothart, Dothart, Dothart. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5636.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5641.54s)]
*  Saying his name in this podcast. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5642.1s)]
*  He, uh, and he did a kind of interesting podcast with this guy who like used to [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5644.18s)]
*  work in AI and is now sort of like the ultimate like doom and gloom dude. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5647.38s)]
*  It was kind of interesting, uh, and not implausible except for one aspect to me. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5650.7s)]
*  Like he's working on a timeline that says like, this is going to happen in 2027 or [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5655.9400000000005s)]
*  2028. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5660.86s)]
*  Like a complete reinvention of society in the next, within two or three years. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5662.38s)]
*  There's part of me, it's like, that can't be, there's no way that can, you know, [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5668.54s)]
*  but like, uh, I, I don't know. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5671.74s)]
*  I, I, I'm not, I'm worried about it. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5674.66s)]
*  I mean, are you, what idea, do you have concerns about this? [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5678.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'm worried about it. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5682.0599999999995s)]
*  I think it's just, it's almost going to be, you're going to have to develop two [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5683.219999999999s)]
*  parts of your brain. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5686.98s)]
*  One that is able to interpret that somebody has done something with AI and made a fake [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5688.099999999999s)]
*  thing seem real. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5694.099999999999s)]
*  And then the other part that realizes what's real. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5695.179999999999s)]
*  I was thinking about this, my dad, the other day, he sent me this, uh, sent me this [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5698.299999999999s)]
*  clip. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5703.179999999999s)]
*  It was a Tibbs press conference. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5703.58s)]
*  You know, sometimes they'll do these press conferences and they'll change the [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5706.179999999999s)]
*  wording and somebody had mailed it to him and he saw it and he was like, I can't [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5709.0599999999995s)]
*  believe Tibbs said all this stuff in the press conference. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5712.78s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5715.7s)]
*  Like he thought it was real and it was just Tibbs saying crazy shit in a press [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5716.62s)]
*  conference and it like hooked my dad and he thought it was real. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5720.06s)]
*  And I was like, that was AI. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5723.38s)]
*  And he's like, ah, I got to figure out like, like, this is so hard. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5724.46s)]
*  I'm going to be 78 November. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5729.18s)]
*  I'd, I'm going to have to spend the rest of my life figuring out what's real and [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5731.26s)]
*  what's not real. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5734.82s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, I think that's actually what's going to happen. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5735.62s)]
*  Well, uh, okay. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5738.58s)]
*  I think, uh, it's true, but I gotta say what you're describing very low on the [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5740.02s)]
*  list of my things I'm worried about. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5745.42s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5747.06s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5747.38s)]
*  You're very low. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5747.66s)]
*  This is the war. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5748.5s)]
*  But you're just probably the premise of like mountainhead. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5749.3s)]
*  Okay. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5752.78s)]
*  Did you see that show that, uh, and like, I thought they did a pretty good job of [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5753.06s)]
*  creating a scenario of how someone in this position could kind of create this [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5759.3s)]
*  sort of, you know, global chaos or whatever. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5762.86s)]
*  Um, so, but I don't think like the fact that they make up these interviews and [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5765.1s)]
*  all that stuff, and it's going to be hard for us to know as consumers, if this is a [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5771.42s)]
*  real thing or that's, that's bad, of course, but I, I, is it the bigger fear [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5775.14s)]
*  that it is going to basically eliminate every interesting job and the only jobs [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5782.3s)]
*  that will remain are the physical blue. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5791.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh, you're going there. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5794.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5795.5s)]
*  I was thinking like, cause what the reason I use my dad example was cause that made [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5795.740000000001s)]
*  me think and mountainhead's a good example of that too, that if you can tweak stuff [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5800.1s)]
*  and make people think something's real when it's not, to me, that's terrifying [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5804.3s)]
*  because eventually we can start doing that with presidents saying things they [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5808.860000000001s)]
*  didn't say and all that stuff. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5812.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5814.3s)]
*  When you're talking about like what's going to happen to society. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5814.58s)]
*  No, I mean, and this is what I'm saying. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5818.26s)]
*  This timeline they're talking about, they're not talking about, like, this is [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5819.54s)]
*  something that's going to happen in 20 years. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5822.34s)]
*  They're talking about these things happening in two years. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5824.74s)]
*  Um, cause the thing that AI can do, and this is like, I don't know, it's so [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5827.820000000001s)]
*  obvious, it's just that kind of done. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5831.3s)]
*  Like the thing that it can do is millions of simulations every second. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5833.0199999999995s)]
*  So, okay. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5840.0199999999995s)]
*  So you can't grow lemon trees in North Dakota, right? [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5840.78s)]
*  So you ask some of these AIs, like, you know, how could we grow lemon [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5844.5s)]
*  trees in a climate that's not hospitable? [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5848.0599999999995s)]
*  You know, it's in hospitable. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5850.5s)]
*  And it will just work through every possibility until it finally concludes. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5851.78s)]
*  Well, what about these seven things? [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5854.9s)]
*  And I was like, so it's going to do that with everything, right? [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5856.58s)]
*  Any such, like there's, there are a lot of situations where people go like, well, [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5861.0599999999995s)]
*  um, we won't be able to do this thing. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5864.94s)]
*  Like this thing we'll need, you know, but it will just simulate ways that can be [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5867.66s)]
*  done until it comes up with one. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5872.7s)]
*  And I don't, what did you say? [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5875.62s)]
*  There's going to be benefits. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5878.179999999999s)]
*  I'm just devil's advocate. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5879.219999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5880.7s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5881.099999999999s)]
*  There's going to be benefits with medicine and, and health and, you know, [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5881.46s)]
*  dieting and all of these things that are probably going to help us. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5885.86s)]
*  So the best case scenario is it that creates this sort of abundance utopia [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5889.179999999999s)]
*  where AI does everything so well and so effectively and so quickly that we don't [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5894.139999999999s)]
*  have to work and that you don't like, you know, and that we like, um, it will, it [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5898.82s)]
*  will revolutionize farming in a way that food will be so cheap. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5904.42s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you don't have a job and it will, it will be able to change [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5907.179999999999s)]
*  all, you know, it will be able to figure out ways to, um, you know, construct homes [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5910.94s)]
*  so cheaply that like, you know, that's the best case scenario, but no one seems [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5915.78s)]
*  to really think that the best case scenario is the most likely outcome. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5921.0599999999995s)]
*  The, you know, what it seems more likely is that it's going to just completely [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5925.74s)]
*  separate society into a fraction of the populace who controls everything because [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5934.0599999999995s)]
*  they control the AI technology. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5941.0599999999995s)]
*  And everybody else will really have like no role at all. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5943.18s)]
*  Like there'll be nothing like, like even there won't even really be a creative [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5947.86s)]
*  role because it's going to, I mean, it's pretty crazy. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5952.7s)]
*  Like you can put, like I put some text that I had written into chat GPD, just [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5956.099999999999s)]
*  see what, like I said, like edit this and tell me what you think, you know? [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5961.66s)]
*  And like, one of the things that said is this is very much in the vein of Chuck [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5964.74s)]
*  Kloesterman. Like it was pretty wild. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5969.14s)]
*  Yeah. Um, I mean, it's pretty crazy. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5974.26s)]
*  Like, you know, has like, wow, you know, it's like, I didn't know. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5976.860000000001s)]
*  Well, I don't feel about that, to be totally honest. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5978.860000000001s)]
*  Um, I, I think that like. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5981.38s)]
*  Unless we are wrong about this, but it doesn't, it doesn't seem like it seemed [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5988.46s)]
*  like we under like, like that, that, that this is going to be far more [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=5994.62s)]
*  transformative than anyone wants. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6000.3s)]
*  And yet we still keep pursuing it. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6004.0199999999995s)]
*  There seems to be no attempt at all to slow the idea or to even question what's [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6006.1s)]
*  going to happen when these things start to manifest itself in the way that we [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6012.38s)]
*  speculate is very possible. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6016.98s)]
*  So the last time this happened since we've been alive was the internet in the [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6019.5s)]
*  mid nineties. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6022.74s)]
*  When everyone was telling us that it, no, I know it's not comparison, but when [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6024.78s)]
*  everyone was telling us in the moment, sure, this is going to change everything. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6027.82s)]
*  And we're like, is it? [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6031.22s)]
*  And they were like, no, no, watch, it's going to change everything. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6032.14s)]
*  Really? [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6034.42s)]
*  And then it slowly changed everything. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6035.06s)]
*  And the AI thing is basically super speeding that, but it's going to change [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6037.3s)]
*  every aspect of life. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6041.82s)]
*  But remember even in 97, the concept of paying for something online, we were so [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6042.86s)]
*  terrified. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6048.22s)]
*  Yes. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6049.06s)]
*  So somebody's going to steal all my stuff. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6049.5s)]
*  We didn't want to give it our credit cards. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6051.22s)]
*  Like you're somehow it seemed different than like giving someone your credit [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6052.74s)]
*  card number over the phone and they were right. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6055.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6057.78s)]
*  It wasn't like the idea that it was sort of in this kind of interconnected system. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6058.42s)]
*  Even the movies from that back then, like the net and disclosure was like, Oh, [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6061.46s)]
*  it's all all the stuff that's out there. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6065.42s)]
*  It's going to, it's going to take our, take our identities in our lives. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6067.46s)]
*  And so I do wonder if there's some of that panic with this, but I asked her [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6071.179999999999s)]
*  agree with you because I think about a lot with my kids, like, you know, my [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6074.82s)]
*  kids, my kids are 20 and 17 and it's like, what are they, what is [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6078.34s)]
*  life going to be like for them in their early thirties? [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6082.62s)]
*  Well, is it just going to be everything AI? [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6085.42s)]
*  Are they going to have jobs in the same way? [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6087.54s)]
*  I have no idea. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6089.34s)]
*  So, you know, a few years ago, this book, Stapiens came out and I thought [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6090.38s)]
*  it was really great. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6094.22s)]
*  Now I realize many people have huge issues with it for all these different [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6095.099999999999s)]
*  reasons, but I thought it was really engaging and really interesting. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6098.7s)]
*  And the author is this Israeli guy, I believe. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6101.3s)]
*  And I saw an interview with him and now he brought up something that I thought [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6103.74s)]
*  is a pretty kind of fascinating point. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6107.78s)]
*  He said that this is maybe the first time the period where now everyone [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6109.46s)]
*  always thinks that there were like living in this totally unique period. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6113.66s)]
*  And a lot of times it's proved to be false, but in this way it might be. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6116.42s)]
*  He's like throughout any other period of time, if you had a kid who was five, [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6120.06s)]
*  you had some sense of things that they needed to know by the time they turned [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6126.18s)]
*  25, you know, if it's, if you're, if it's the 1500s, it was like, you [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6131.02s)]
*  have to learn how to ride a horse. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6135.46s)]
*  Like you have to, you have to learn how to like, uh, feel like, you know, [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6136.9800000000005s)]
*  make rights you need to do all the, you know, for us, when we were young, it's [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6140.1s)]
*  like, we can learn how to drive, but you can have to drive in 20 years. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6144.14s)]
*  Um, you're going to know how to read, need to know how to read all these things. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6147.3s)]
*  This is the first time where we really have no idea what will be necessary or [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6150.42s)]
*  essential to people 20 years from now. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6156.62s)]
*  It is very possible. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6158.82s)]
*  They will not need to know how to drive. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6159.66s)]
*  It is increasingly possible. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6162.02s)]
*  They will not need to know how to read. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6163.78s)]
*  I mean, these, like these fundamental things, um, are, are completely now kind [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6166.62s)]
*  of up for grabs in a way that is kind of unique to the experience of what's [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6171.34s)]
*  happening with computers right now. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6176.46s)]
*  I don't, and that someone's going to be listening to this and they're going to [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6178.66s)]
*  be like, ah, no, that's not true. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6181.139999999999s)]
*  What about this? [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6182.66s)]
*  You know, let's talk about the industrial revolution and all these things. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6183.259999999999s)]
*  And I understand that, but there is something bizarre about how unclear [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6186.179999999999s)]
*  the immediate future now sees, like how, how, how, how, how no one knows what [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6192.5s)]
*  it's going to be like in a hundred years, but I have a sense that we don't know [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6197.9s)]
*  what America is going to be like in five years and that's weird. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6201.06s)]
*  I mean, that's a weird thing. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6205.82s)]
*  Well, and the other thing is all the rich people that buy businesses or try to [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6207.22s)]
*  build businesses or expand businesses and invest in all of these different [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6212.26s)]
*  things and technologies, all of them are just in on AI right now and that's it. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6216.02s)]
*  And it's like this big battleground because all those people seem to feel [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6220.22s)]
*  like this is going to determine the future of the next 20 years period. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6224.3s)]
*  This is what we have to worry about. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6228.14s)]
*  We need a plan for this, which makes me nervous. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6229.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6232.9400000000005s)]
*  And I also, it's like, you know, cause when we talk about these things, always [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6233.42s)]
*  the first idea is like, well, it's going to hurt poor people first. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6238.58s)]
*  It's going to hurt, you know, sort of marginalized people first, you know? [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6242.62s)]
*  And that's usually how these things work. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6246.06s)]
*  But this is a little different in that I feel like it could completely reinvent. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6248.38s)]
*  The meaning of the economy, what the economy is, what money means that [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6255.74s)]
*  there are people right now who are pretty wealthy and pretty secure, who could [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6261.42s)]
*  find themselves much closer to the bottom 2% than the top 2% in a short amount of time. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6267.46s)]
*  That wealth is going to be kind of sandwiched in the degree to which the [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6275.54s)]
*  difference between having $4 million and $40,000 is much less different than it [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6280.22s)]
*  is currently because the meaning of money will change. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6287.98s)]
*  And I mean, these are sort of like, and, you know, when you kind of look at like, [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6291.82s)]
*  kind of like metrics that we were used to sort of thinking about, like the idea of [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6296.38s)]
*  inflation, like every 20 years, things double in price, or if you look back to [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6300.0199999999995s)]
*  20 years, what you could buy for $20, you now need $40 for. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6304.5s)]
*  I don't know if those things are going to continue. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6308.66s)]
*  Like these things that we kind of, these kind of loose understandings we [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6311.1s)]
*  have of how money works, things seem to be escalating in a way that makes me, [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6313.94s)]
*  you know, it's kind of strange running this podcast in this kind of dark way, [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6319.66s)]
*  but I am worried about this and I don't know what can be done. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6322.1s)]
*  Well, it does seem like the first time everything's on the table in a long time [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6326.02s)]
*  with culture and life and everything. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6329.7s)]
*  Like you could tell me AI is going to figure out a way to make all this food [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6333.3s)]
*  that will be just as edible and healthy as anything else. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6338.42s)]
*  And it's going to be way cheaper and food will become much, much, much cheaper [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6342.42s)]
*  in all of these different ways. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6346.38s)]
*  I believe it. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6349.26s)]
*  It's, it's almost, that would almost be like a podcast. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6350.14s)]
*  What would you not believe about what's going to happen the next 15 years? [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6352.34s)]
*  I would believe just about any outcome with AI. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6355.26s)]
*  Um, like could we have, could we have CNN anchors that are just AI anchors? [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6358.3s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6364.14s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6364.74s)]
*  Even, even the best case scenario is weird. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6367.02s)]
*  Like let's say in the best case scenario, AI makes it so that essentially no one [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6369.7s)]
*  has to work that robots do all the, all the manual physical things. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6373.74s)]
*  AI makes all the decisions and creates everything. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6378.38s)]
*  Like what do we as humans do? [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6381.22s)]
*  Like what, what, what does life become if there is no physical work and no creative [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6385.5s)]
*  work? [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6391.7s)]
*  Like it seems very, well, okay. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6392.58s)]
*  I, I knew kind of buddies that Ben Affleck, so I, I don't often say this, but like Ben [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6394.5s)]
*  Affleck said something that I was, I thought I was pretty smart kind of like I was [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6399.38s)]
*  surprised. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6403.54s)]
*  He was talking, someone asked him about this and he was like, well, it's not going to [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6403.94s)]
*  affect like the highest echelon of creative people. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6407.18s)]
*  Like it won't affect actors, directors, but it'll affect everything below it. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6411.5s)]
*  Like there's certain things that people will just, they will crave humanity in and [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6415.58s)]
*  they will not accept, you know, a digitized actor. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6419.3s)]
*  And I'm moving up, but every, all the jobs below it will be gone sort of. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6422.46s)]
*  And he said, like, well, you know, when the, in the movie industry, at one point we [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6426.86s)]
*  lost all this money when this, when DVDs disappeared, because that was like a second [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6430.38s)]
*  release of the movie and you can kind of make the money back. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6434.82s)]
*  And that's the reason there's no middle-class in filmmaking now is because we don't have [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6437.34s)]
*  that kind of that second boost. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6440.22s)]
*  But he's like, what if it's in the future? [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6441.5s)]
*  It's like, say, watch, you watch all of succession and then you have the option to [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6443.1s)]
*  pay say $200 and AI will make you one version of succession just for you. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6448.5s)]
*  One episode of succession where you can say what you want to have happen in it. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6455.5s)]
*  You know, it will have all the actors create your own adventure. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6459.38s)]
*  Succession. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6462.42s)]
*  You'll have one app, you know, so that'll be like the bonus thing. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6462.9800000000005s)]
*  If you're fair, you know, as a, well, it'd be kind of a cool thing. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6465.18s)]
*  I wouldn't like the idea of all television being this way, but it would be neat if [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6467.74s)]
*  you could say like, what if this happened and this happens, you know, and that, you [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6471.06s)]
*  know, and to me, that's kind of a good case scenario. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6473.9400000000005s)]
*  But my thing is this. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6476.42s)]
*  I think that as time moves on, somebody like my kids or maybe even your kids will not [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6477.46s)]
*  see much difference between AI created content and actual content. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6486.820000000001s)]
*  Well, especially music. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6492.54s)]
*  I think, I think music will be the first way that goes. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6494.06s)]
*  There'll be some sort of Taylor Swift that's just all AI that becomes popular and people [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6497.7s)]
*  are like, I don't care if it's not real. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6501.94s)]
*  I like it. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6503.54s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's interesting to think about it like how we're like in podcasting, right? [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6504.46s)]
*  Like, what if it was possible to take every podcast you've ever done? [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6508.46s)]
*  I think it's possible now. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6513.7s)]
*  And then kind of create a new pod. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6515.46s)]
*  Like you would just kind of constantly create these ideas from like old ideas, you know? [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6517.46s)]
*  I'm sure it's going to happen. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6522.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6524.42s)]
*  We're about to be replaced. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6525.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6526.46s)]
*  Well, it could be. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6526.74s)]
*  And then I guess we're supposed to somehow kind of also that really kind of plays into [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6528.74s)]
*  this idea that like nothing new will be created. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6533.46s)]
*  I mean, like I know every time I do any of these things, I am talking about like the [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6538.42s)]
*  slow cancellation of the future because I'm just obsessed with this idea. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6541.74s)]
*  I think it's the most important idea that I've come across in the last 20 years. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6544.42s)]
*  But like it does seem to me that likelihood of new ideas being kind of put into the [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6548.14s)]
*  cultural bloodstream is just going to disappear. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6554.46s)]
*  And that we're just in the content we have now pretty much is going to be the content [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6558.3s)]
*  in perpetuity, just sort of repackaged. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6562.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, the question is in 20 years with where we're going with AI, would Nathan [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6565.58s)]
*  Fielder's last rehearsal season even exist? [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6569.94s)]
*  Because nobody, AI could never think of that. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6573.62s)]
*  Yes, that's true. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6575.86s)]
*  So I guess some might say, well, that's proof that they'll never happen. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6577.26s)]
*  That will that that that there that there's no way like what was it? [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6580.58s)]
*  What was the Gattaca tagline? [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6585.62s)]
*  There's no really human spirit. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6587.42s)]
*  I think. Yeah, like that there's certain things that we'll just never be able to do. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6589.26s)]
*  Although then whenever you talk to anybody who knows about AI, they're like, I don't [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6593.7s)]
*  know. I don't know what's like. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6598.06s)]
*  Like once once we. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6600.18s)]
*  Because if you think about AI as a child, right, think of it as a child. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6604.06s)]
*  OK, when does a child become self aware of itself? [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6608.46s)]
*  Like three or four or five, right? [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6612.74s)]
*  Yeah. But are they aware of themselves or are they being socialized to understand [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6614.900000000001s)]
*  that their self and their something? [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6618.9800000000005s)]
*  You know, is it possible that while AI computers will never become wholly self [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6620.22s)]
*  aware, they will adopt all the qualities we associate with self awareness [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6625.5s)]
*  and it will essentially be indistinguishable. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6631.58s)]
*  Like they will still they will still be unable to actually cognitively come up [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6633.900000000001s)]
*  with an idea that wasn't someone else's. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6639.02s)]
*  But there's a lot of people like that, too. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6642.3s)]
*  There's a lot of people who can't come up with any idea they haven't heard from [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6644.18s)]
*  somebody else. Let's say let's say two years from now. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6647.02s)]
*  AI figures out how to make another Nirvana album. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6650.62s)]
*  It takes all the Nirvana songs possible. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6655.02s)]
*  And the technology is so good that could be like, this is actually the album. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6658.34s)]
*  If Kurt doesn't die in 94, this is the album we think they would have made in 95. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6662.0199999999995s)]
*  And they release an album and it's got songs and lyrics and actually feels like [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6666.86s)]
*  it could have been the Nirvana album. Would you listen to it? [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6671.219999999999s)]
*  Well, I would definitely listen to it. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6674.94s)]
*  The question, what if you look, what if you like it? [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6677.9s)]
*  OK, this is like a real kind of fucking bullshit answer. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6679.78s)]
*  But like I would listen to it. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6682.78s)]
*  The question is, what would I hear? [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6683.94s)]
*  And it would actually force me to confront something that maybe I can't confront, [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6685.86s)]
*  which is that when I'm hearing popular music, am I really listening to the music [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6690.22s)]
*  or am I also injecting everything I know about the individual who made it [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6694.54s)]
*  and the history of music and what I like about music and what I am like [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6698.98s)]
*  and who I am as a person and what I think rock means, what all these things [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6702.74s)]
*  into the thing and then hearing it back. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6705.86s)]
*  And if it comes from AI, will I be like the only thing is the sonics? [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6707.62s)]
*  So the museum and there are certainly artists [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6713.74s)]
*  who I already enjoy in that way that that I that I have no relationship with. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6717.86s)]
*  I don't even know the person necessarily. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6723.82s)]
*  If I listen to classical music, for example, [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6725.46s)]
*  if I hear some classical music that I like, there's a high likelihood [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6727.7s)]
*  I don't even know who made it right. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6731.0599999999995s)]
*  I know nothing about don't know what can't. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6732.299999999999s)]
*  Not only do I know what year it came out, I might not be able even to say [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6734.0599999999995s)]
*  like what century it is from. Right. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6737.82s)]
*  So that I'm only I'm only appreciating that just for the sound. Right. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6739.9s)]
*  Does that work with a band like Nirvana? [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6744.54s)]
*  Probably not, because pop music, rock music, hip hop, all of these things [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6747.46s)]
*  are not exclusively sonic experiences. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6753.5s)]
*  Yeah, they are an outgrowth of a culture that we associate with youth [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6757.860000000001s)]
*  and that we associate with all these other things. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6762.580000000001s)]
*  And that, you know, so it might be, you know, impossible to. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6764.580000000001s)]
*  Like maybe the highest compliment you'd be able to give. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6771.620000000001s)]
*  And the example you describe is like, I can't believe how much this seems [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6774.94s)]
*  like Nirvana. I can't believe how close this is. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6779.62s)]
*  So it almost be like a plant based burger. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6782.9s)]
*  Yes. You're like, wow, this really tastes like a cheeseburger. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6785.9s)]
*  But I also know it's not a cheeseburger. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6789.219999999999s)]
*  Although in that case, in that case, you could say like, well, this is great. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6791.219999999999s)]
*  Now I'm going to eat this. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6794.46s)]
*  They've made this plant based cheeseburger that I can't tell the difference. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6796.139999999999s)]
*  It must be healthier than eating meat. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6799.5s)]
*  It's going to eliminate our cattle. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6801.259999999999s)]
*  It's going to, you know, the amount of methane they're supposedly putting out, [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6803.94s)]
*  but also the idea that it's somehow cruel to slaughter them and all these things. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6806.5s)]
*  There is no that doesn't happen with like we wouldn't get the new Nirvana. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6809.82s)]
*  Oh, this is great. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6813.54s)]
*  It's like, no, I don't got to worry about the singer killing himself. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6814.379999999999s)]
*  Like, that's not going to happen. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6817.5s)]
*  You know, the fact that Kurt Cobain killed himself [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6818.86s)]
*  has an impact on how Nirvana sounds. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6823.94s)]
*  And I know that sounds crazy, but it does for most people. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6827.099999999999s)]
*  And I guarantee you, if you play Nirvana to somebody who has no idea [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6830.179999999999s)]
*  who Kurt Cobain is compared to someone who does, the appreciation of that [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6833.74s)]
*  music is going to be slightly shifted because it is impossible to not [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6837.5s)]
*  know the things that we know. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6842.82s)]
*  I feel the same way about Millie Vanille. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6844.58s)]
*  Um, you know, they had a couple of good songs, but now you can't, [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6846.7s)]
*  can't unsee the fact that there was the lip syncing. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6850.62s)]
*  Um, I don't know where this goes. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6853.34s)]
*  It makes me super nervous and now you've made me uneasy for the rest of the day. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6858.0599999999995s)]
*  And we have to go. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6862.54s)]
*  Um, I did my job. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6863.66s)]
*  You have two books coming out in 2026. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6868.34s)]
*  We should mention. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6870.1s)]
*  Strange. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6870.86s)]
*  Um, so, uh, so yeah, I have two books coming out next year, which cause I haven't [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6871.7s)]
*  had them for a variety of reasons. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6876.02s)]
*  There's a, I have a book coming out in January, which I'm going to send you. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6878.54s)]
*  And you'll be on before you'll be on before January. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6883.82s)]
*  So it's a, it's a, it's a book about the meaning of football. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6886.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6890.62s)]
*  It's just called. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6891.34s)]
*  Football. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6892.62s)]
*  It's like Walter Camp's 1896 book football. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6893.3s)]
*  Okay. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6896.22s)]
*  Um, and I think that you will agree with 50% of it. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6896.66s)]
*  Okay. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6902.5s)]
*  I think 30% you will strongly disagree with and 20% you will be like, this [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6902.86s)]
*  doesn't seem like it's about football, but that was coming out in January. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6908.26s)]
*  I would have loved to have it come out before this football season starts [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6911.900000000001s)]
*  because there's always a chance that something's going to happen in football. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6915.5s)]
*  That's going to change the meaning of this book, but I don't think so. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6917.86s)]
*  And then I have another book coming out next fall, uh, which the reason I have [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6920.860000000001s)]
*  two books coming out is cause I had to have this come out on a different publisher [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6927.46s)]
*  because my publisher rejected this book. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6930.18s)]
*  They were like, it's too weird. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6934.34s)]
*  Uh, but I want it to come out. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6936.02s)]
*  So it's going to come out. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6937.34s)]
*  I can't wait. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6940.5s)]
*  Um, a pleasure as always. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6941.860000000001s)]
*  Great to see you, Chuck. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6943.820000000001s)]
*  Well, thanks. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIBv6CUCrvc&t=6944.5s)]
