# Six Major Things Going On in the NBA With Bill Simmons  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [October 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCkMgM6KIE)
*  Alright, now it's time for a special part of today's episode brought to you by our friends
*  at McLobe Ultra, the official beer sponsor of the NBA.
*  What an honor that is.
*  The NBA season is here and McLobe Ultra courtside is getting fans closer to the game than ever
*  before.
*  Closer to the players, the stories, the celebrations.
*  All you have to do is check out McLobe Ultra dot com slash courtside.
*  That's easy to learn how you can get closer to the action.
*  So what we're gonna do right now, I'm going to open up a six pack.
*  We're going to unpack six major things going on in the world of basketball right now.
*  It's also a sick pack because somehow it's day four and I'm still sick.
*  That's fine.
*  I'm a grinder.
*  I'm a gamer.
*  I'm into 82 games.
*  I'm not like Joe Ellen Bede.
*  I'm not sitting out open and weak.
*  So we're gonna do a little six pack right now.
*  Just six things I noticed.
*  I don't want to step on part two and we did the league pass ranking.
*  So I'm trying to keep it a little separate of that.
*  Six things I've noticed.
*  Number one, it feels like Orlando officially took over Florida from the Miami Heat last
*  night.
*  So what does that mean?
*  Well, they had the swagger, they had the competitiveness, they have Palo in year three, who is clearly
*  undeniably the best player on the court.
*  KCP was there.
*  So defensively, they just felt like they went up a level and they just absolutely throttled
*  throttled.
*  Throttled Miami.
*  And it was kind of a special night for Miami.
*  They were honoring Pat Riley.
*  The halftime ceremony was like a half hour.
*  Didn't matter.
*  35 year old Jimmy Butler, three points in day one of his revenge season.
*  I think I'm gonna do really well in the futures that we did with Vercellen House.
*  I'm already starting to worry about this Miami future, which we'll talk about in a second.
*  But Orlando answered all the things that I was hoping I would see from them.
*  We talked about in the over under pod, when you start going up from like you're in the
*  20s, then you go up to the high 30s, 40 range, then you're up to 47 wins.
*  This should be the season that they go up into the mid 50s.
*  And from what I saw last night, it's going to happen.
*  Miami, which I think the over under was around 43.
*  And the theory was, well, they're going to be healthy.
*  Jimmy's going to actually play.
*  Now we've got a fantastic team of Queensborough with a very tough team.
*  They're having it now.
*  We've had less of a tough Bergeners in the backion, the
*  ball, away from a 좋아요.
*  two playoffs, all of a sudden the Knicks beat them and it just felt like within a
*  year it was over.
*  And in 1990 they went from 48 wins in 92, which was their, the year after the
*  window to 40 the next year.
*  And then there were 20 and 62 bites by, uh, 1994.
*  And I'm starting to wonder, is that Miami's future unless they do something
*  drastic?
*  So what happens?
*  We, we always wondered, all right, if this goes bad for Miami is starting out
*  of the gate, would Butler be available?
*  What does that mean?
*  He's pretty expensive.
*  He's almost a hundred million dollars for two years.
*  They did not give them an extension, which I think was smart from a trade
*  standpoint, you go through all the teams and there's less Butler suitors than
*  you would think.
*  So the obvious team, and this ties into another lesson from watching league
*  pass, uh, in a music next Hayes last night for seven hours, he used it as too
*  many guys and it's going to be a problem for them.
*  And as Darrell Moore hates this theory, but I think this is a real theory.
*  The too many guys theory when too many guys think that they deserve between 30
*  and 40 minutes a game, you tend to have like some sort of Rocky.
*  It just doesn't feel right.
*  It did the Houston thing.
*  Didn't feel right to me yesterday.
*  I like all their players, but I'm not sure they know which players to play.
*  And they're like basically dying to make a three for one trade.
*  Houston was the team that jumped out to me the most last night as a Butler home
*  because that ties it with the Mayadoka.
*  They have all the different assets.
*  Like they could, they have a Steven Adams expiring, Pustil and Brooks.
*  Then you could move wherever you want from there with an asset.
*  Like could it be Thompson, the Thompson twin, amen Thompson.
*  Um, could it be like a cam Whitmore, Tate's expiring and a bunch of the
*  picks that they have, maybe it's not that many picks.
*  Maybe Jimmy Butler doesn't have as much value as we think, but in my head, I
*  was thinking Brooks and Adams and Thompson for Butler made a ton of sense
*  for both sides if Miami was like it's reboot time, cause they, they would both
*  stay a little relevant, but also be able to move on from this other thing.
*  Because if it gets bad, which we'll see, it might've just been a one game aberration.
*  That's why you can't overreact to week one.
*  But if it gets bad, they don't have a lot of options and they got to move fast.
*  Cause what you don't want is an unhappy Jimmy Butler.
*  And then you're, you're trading them for 30 cents in the dollar.
*  New Orleans is a possibility.
*  That's that's Brandon Ingram would have to be in that.
*  Um, and maybe Jordan Hawkins, but I, if I'm new Orleans, I'm not even sure
*  why I would be thinking about that.
*  And then golden state would be the other one.
*  Golden state, Steve curves playing 12 guys.
*  Um, and, and proud of it was bragging about my 12 band rotation.
*  That's never worked in the history of the league, but I think he's trying
*  to keep everybody involved because that team knows there are three for one.
*  So could that be just Wiggins, coming in loony down the road?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know what Miami's thinking with their future, but I'll tell you this.
*  They're not in the class with Orlando anymore.
*  Um, and I think Cleveland probably same thing.
*  Next Celtics, no way.
*  Uh, they're just not good enough anymore.
*  And this is what happens.
*  You have these windows, the window ends and either they have to try to add to
*  the nucleus they have, or they have to call an audible and maybe think about
*  traded Jimmy's that was my biggest takeaway last night.
*  I was like, Holy shit, Jimmy Butler, but I could trade it soon.
*  Second one on the six pack, AK the sick pack, the rookie of the year race, uh,
*  is going to be the weirdest one we've had since 2017, which was Brogdon winning
*  Sarich finishing second, and then Joel Embiida played 31 games, somehow
*  finished third and rookie of the year.
*  So that was the weirdest 2013 was super weird.
*  That was Michael Carter Williams edging out Victor Ola Depot and Trey Burke.
*  And one of the Palmleys was fourth.
*  I don't even remember which one, but, uh, you remember Michael Carter
*  Williams just kind of putting up.
*  Decent stats on a terrible Sixers team.
*  And none of us felt good about voting for him, but, uh, we didn't
*  really have any other choice.
*  And then 2001 was the other horrible one.
*  That was Mike Miller, who I think averaged 11 points a game, one rookie of
*  the year, Kenny Martin, second, Mark Jackson, third, not Mark Jackson, the
*  announcer Mark Jackson with a C the center who was like 26 that season.
*  So those are the three worst rookie of the year races that we've had this one.
*  Zach Eady is still the favorite of plus two 90.
*  If you watched them last night, uh, listen, I'm not panicking.
*  I'm keeping my edie stock, but that was last night was a disaster.
*  He just found trouble immediately.
*  He missed foul shots.
*  Uh, they were going at him on defense and did not look great.
*  Reese's Shay is plus six 50.
*  Hold that thought.
*  Reed Shepherd seven to one, and I'm not sure he's going to get enough
*  minutes unless they trade them.
*  Uh, castle plus nine 50 spurs.
*  We haven't seen him yet.
*  And then connect on the Lakers.
*  I don't think he's going to get enough minutes.
*  He'd have to have some sort of injury, but he's at least somebody that is going
*  to be, it seems like he's going to have an impact right away, at least as a bench.
*  Reese's Shay is the one I'm targeting here.
*  Plus six 50 it's dropped, uh, even from two days ago, I think it was eight to one
*  or plus seven 50 now it's plus six 50 on Fandle.
*  Listen, I made fun of the Reese's Shay pick around the time when it happened.
*  Just the concept of the skinny French guy, his name is Zachary Reese's Shay.
*  What are the odds that somebody with that name is going to be good?
*  All, all stupid stuff that I love to make fun of.
*  But when you watch the clips from him overseas, hustler, good athlete,
*  unafraid good three point shooter.
*  There was stuff there that seemed like, Oh, this will be interesting to
*  see if it translates.
*  Watch them in the preseason house.
*  And I talked about this on the over under pod.
*  Huge fan has really hustles runs the floor.
*  Like there's certain rookies that would learn a lot, um, just about the hustle
*  that this guy has, including maybe a couple in the Lakers that aren't don't connect.
*  Um, but I think he, I think he's going to have a real impact for them.
*  Even last night, his box score, he was like two for seven, two for eight,
*  but he got good shots.
*  Like he missed a layup where he got fouled.
*  Um, he not afraid to shoot threes.
*  He's a good defensively.
*  And I just kind of liked that Hawks team in general.
*  We went over on them.
*  That was a lock for me.
*  And I think this kid is good.
*  Uh, so that would be, that would be, I'm not allowed to bet on this
*  because I have a vote, but that would be, I think the odds are a little out of whack
*  because especially like if Hunter got hurt, any of the swings on the Hawks got hurt.
*  I think that kid's good.
*  I think he's good.
*  I think they might've nailed that pick.
*  If you did the draft over again, I would probably still take him first.
*  It's be like him versus shepherd and castle would be the three do-overs.
*  And I still think he's in the mix.
*  So somehow the Hawks who usually screw up everything did not screw up that pick.
*  All right.
*  Third takeaway for the six pack from just from last night.
*  And this is a preseason thing too.
*  We talked about in the over under pod.
*  Well, Ben Simmons actually have traded a lot of the picks.
*  Well, Ben Simmons actually have trade value this year.
*  So this is easily one of the strangest careers in the history of the league.
*  He's only 28 years old.
*  He's only played 333 games and 22 playoff games.
*  This is his ninth year.
*  By contrast, Jaylen Brown's 541 and 124.
*  They were the same draft in 2020, which seems like it was a hundred years ago.
*  He was third team, all NBA and first team, all defense.
*  So that's both a million years ago and also not that long ago.
*  Those four and a half years.
*  He's been a witness protection for the last three years and nobody
*  thinks he likes basketball, literally nobody.
*  And yet when you watch him, it seems like he'd be fun to play with.
*  So like, if you watched the Nets last night, you knew nothing.
*  And they had kind of a noble loss to the Hawks where they kept coming back,
*  coming back and somehow covered miraculously.
*  Might have a little action on that one.
*  Uh, you would have three takeaways from that game, knowing nothing other than
*  the salaries.
*  And one is that the Nick Clarkson extension they gave was idiotic.
*  And, um, I mean, he, I don't even know if he's a crunch time
*  guy for them anymore with Simmons.
*  You would think cam Thomas is a hall of fame, worst guy ever to play with.
*  And this is something we talked about two weeks ago in the over under pot.
*  I was saying how the 1980 San Diego Clippers were one of my favorite.
*  Bad team, good stats guys.
*  They had Freeman Williams and world be free.
*  Uh, they just a bunch of dudes, spend Nader 15 rebounds a game cam Thomas.
*  It's going up.
*  If he has it, there was a moment in the first quarter where it seemed like he
*  was on pace for 60 field goals.
*  He scored 20 plus on the fourth quarter.
*  Every time he gets it, it's going up.
*  If somebody else shoots and crunch time, he's furious and he just
*  seems miserable to play with.
*  So that would be a second take away.
*  And then the, and by the way, that's the perfect guy to have on a bad team.
*  That's trying to tank for a top five pick.
*  You want somebody that at least is going to put up stats and seem interesting
*  into the casual offense, seem interesting.
*  And yet he's helping you lose.
*  Ben Simmons is actually an asset was the third takeaway.
*  Uh, he could handle the ball.
*  His point guard was size.
*  He could get to the rim when he wanted.
*  He was rebounding.
*  He was playing defense.
*  They didn't play in crunch time, which I thought was interesting.
*  I think they were just afraid of his shooting and his free throw shooting
*  especially, but, um, it feels like he's healthy again.
*  So then you start thinking, well, what does that mean?
*  He's an expiring at 40.3 million.
*  Could they trade them?
*  I went through every team.
*  I don't see it, but here's what I do see.
*  I think he's has a chance to become one of the most fascinating February
*  bio guys, uh, in a few years because like, he could be the center in New Orleans.
*  He could be an absolutely crazy Draymond green backup at golden state.
*  He could be a really fun heat culture reclamation project.
*  He's kind of exactly what the Knicks need.
*  And I'll talk about them.
*  They're coming up later in the six pack.
*  But, uh, I'm watching this Ben Simmons thing, because if he can prove that
*  he's healthy over the next three months and Brooklyn, they don't want to keep
*  them, they don't want to be good.
*  So either he's trade or he's, he's a buyout guy, but I actually think he
*  could have an impact on the playoff race playing 18 to 20 minutes a game
*  for a really good team.
*  The guy's a good basketball player.
*  Maybe he gives a shit now.
*  We'll see.
*  Uh, the fourth thing, this is a brief one, but ESPN built there a lot of
*  their coverage yesterday around the Intuit dome.
*  Which is the new Steve Ballmer thing that opened up that I have not been to yet.
*  Um, it's very cool, apparently really cool basketball arena.
*  ESPN played it up.
*  Like we were sending the astronauts to the moon in 1969, and this is a recurring
*  theme with TV networks, whether it's football, basketball, baseball, viewers
*  don't care about arenas and stadiums.
*  They all look the same when you're watching them on TV, maybe the ball
*  parks outdoors look different.
*  But when you're talking basketball, when you're talking football,
*  they all look the same and it's like, Oh, Jerry world.
*  Oh my God.
*  Look at that jumbo trying.
*  I can't really tell unless I'm there.
*  Same thing for the Quippers.
*  They're blowing this up.
*  Look at this wall.
*  And then the game starts and it just looks like every other game
*  I'm watching on league pass.
*  So I would urge everybody to settle down and maybe scale back to Steve
*  Ballmer reaction shots from 700 million during a two and a half hour game to
*  maybe, maybe 10, just the thought.
*  All right.
*  This is my superior take buckle up, get ready.
*  Jason Tatum's MVP case.
*  Oh yeah.
*  You heard me.
*  He fixed the hitch.
*  He'd hitch in a shot.
*  His shot, something weird happened with a shot.
*  It's almost like a golf, like tiger would have those moments when all of a
*  sudden his swing was a little messed up.
*  It happens to golfers happens to shooters might be happening to
*  McHale bridges right now, but he fixed the hitch.
*  And I just want to thank Steve Kerr because I think Steve Kerr put a
*  giant throbbing chip on his shoulder by not playing him in the Olympics.
*  And by the way, Tatum didn't really deserve to play in the Olympics.
*  As I mentioned on previous pods, his shot wasn't going in.
*  They needed him to be a knockdown shooter.
*  And if the Tatum that we saw on opening night was there in the Olympics,
*  Steve Kerr would have played them.
*  So I don't care because this is great because this is a title defense season
*  where everyone has a chip on their shoulders.
*  Somehow.
*  I love it.
*  He made seven plus threes twice last season.
*  So there were real signs last year that the three pointer or something
*  weird was going on in 23.
*  He made it five times, 2022, five times.
*  Um, and his shot looks like if it, and I did this whole thing on my pod about
*  how his shot is rookie year, his second year, how smooth it was, the quick
*  release, and then he developed this weird hitch thing and the hitch is gone.
*  And he looks like Tatum again, his MVP odds dropped 13 to one to nine to one.
*  I'm so mad we didn't talk about this in the over under pods because this
*  would have been a great pick.
*  And the reason none of us want to do it was because we didn't know what a
*  shot was going to look like.
*  And his shot just was better two, three years ago than it was last year.
*  But now that a shot seems like it's back, you start looking at he's 27 years old
*  this year and you're 27 guys in general.
*  This is usually the year.
*  So you go back the last 40 plus years, NBA history, 1983 Moses, 27 years old,
*  MVP title, 84 bird MVP title, 87 magic MVP title.
*  All those guys were 27 91 Jordan MVP title, 2000 Shaq MVP title, 2004 KG
*  only MVP season 2006 dirt.
*  That was his breakout season when he beat the Spurs and in game seven and went to
*  the finals 2006 Kobe, that was the greatest Kobe season, 35 points a game.
*  He was unbelievable.
*  He should have won the MVP 2012 LeBron MVP first title Miami.
*  That was the year he put the chest hair on and killed the Celtics 2016 curry 73
*  wins MVP finals, 2017 hardened finished second and MVP that year should have won
*  should have beaten Westbrook.
*  I'm on the right side of history.
*  Thank you very much.
*  I voted for hearted 2023 Yokeage title, second MVP, a second in MVP,
*  but won the title that year.
*  So this is a re this is the most important age for NBA stars slash superstars.
*  And even you think like Duncan and Yanis Duncan's greatest year was 2003.
*  He was 26 and Yanis's greatest year was 21 when he won the title.
*  Uh, so did Duncan by the way.
*  But Yanis was 26 that year, 22 Yanis, I think was the best ever version of the
*  Yanis.
*  That was the year the Celtics miraculously beat him and ended up going to the finals.
*  But Yanis was incredible that year.
*  The point is 27 is the year and it should be the peak of somebody's career in a lot
*  of different ways.
*  And maybe this is going to happen to Tatum.
*  So nine to one again, I'm not allowed to vote on it, but seems low to me.
*  All right.
*  Last one for the six pack.
*  So New York and Minnesota took big identity change swings with that towns for
*  Randall and DDP trade.
*  And I thought I was fascinating watching both of them on Tuesday night because,
*  um, the Knicks just felt different from last year.
*  A big piece of that is Hartenstein.
*  They lost the offensive rebounding.
*  They lost the defense and they lost the playmaking.
*  He was like a secondary playmaker for them.
*  And so that was, that had nothing to do with the trade because they'd already lost
*  them. OK, see, but, um, they really missed that.
*  And then, you know, not having DeFincenzo with the Villanova four, with the, how,
*  how, how well those three guys played together, plus with bridges, the extra
*  shooting, um, you felt that one too.
*  And then conversely with Minnesota, no towns, the size that him and go bear and
*  Naz read and just how, how suffocated and overwhelming the three of those guys were
*  as a, as a three person combo.
*  It really felt like they missed that.
*  Randall just looked horrible.
*  Uh, the Randall go bear minutes were really bad and Randall, I didn't think he
*  played that hard.
*  It didn't see, it seemed like he really screwed up every, it screwed up their
*  spacing, everything you felt kind of iffy about that trade was, was, was on display
*  for the first game.
*  We'll say, you know, I'm not, I'm not, I'm giving them 20 games.
*  I want to see how they incorporate all this stuff, how they do it.
*  I want to see how they do it.
*  I want to see how they do it.
*  I want to see how they do it.
*  I want to see how they do it.
*  I want to see how they do it.
*  I want to see how they do it.
*  I want to see how they incorporate all this stuff, how they figure out the
*  lineups, but, um, so you had that and then you had bridges who was the other big
*  next trade and OGN and OB and Tatum and Brown did whatever they wanted in that
*  game.
*  So you got those two guys, you're trying to build this team to defeat the Celtics
*  and the Celtics demolish them.
*  Um, and then the, the Randall piece, like, I just didn't feel like Minnesota
*  was better anyway.
*  So how does this get fixed?
*  Well, for the next, um, they're going to have to get one more big guy at some
*  point, um, before February, maybe it's just Mitchell Robinson coming back.
*  I don't trust Mitchell Robinson to stay healthy, but maybe that's the answer, but
*  they need defense and rebounding and they need bridges.
*  They need more from them.
*  They need him to figure out a shot.
*  They really need playmaking from him and you could see them trying to work him
*  into stuff, but, uh, I I've already had so much fun making fun of the Nick fan
*  friends that I have about bridges, the hitch and his shot.
*  It's like, Whoa, do you know shot was fucked up when you traded five first
*  round picks for him?
*  It's great that the next fans have no response.
*  There's no, no, he'll figure it out.
*  He's 39% career shooter.
*  Uh, he had one good three in the Boston game where it's like, okay, maybe he'll
*  figure it out, but, um, they just need more from him.
*  You give up that much for bridges.
*  He needs to be in the offense more.
*  He needs to be a 40% three point shooter.
*  He just needs to feel more impactful than he did in game one.
*  That's not rocket science.
*  Say that, but so bridges is the guy to watch for that team.
*  Then, uh, Minnesota, I'd like to see more read in Randall lineups and
*  read and go bear and less towns and, and go, Brad, like to see them go smaller.
*  And I want to watch whether aunt gets frustrated or not because the spacing was
*  weird, you could see him getting frustrated during the game.
*  Um, all the said in Minnesota, such a feel good story last year, 56 wins.
*  And now seems like a work in progress and what made them special last year.
*  They just didn't seem that special.
*  They seem like a team that Anthony Davis was just running a mock on.
*  So I'm watching them, both of those teams, identities, these first 20 games,
*  will they be able to find their 24, 25 versions of them?
*  So that's what we got for the, for the six pack.
*  We'll cover the league pass rankings in part two of the podcast, but that
*  was today's six major things.
*  And remember, make a little bout your court side, get you closer to
*  the game than ever before.
