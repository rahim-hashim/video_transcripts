# The LeBron Playoff Angle | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxzkUdLSMnY)
*  There's a LeBron angle to this playoffs that if people have really talked about it
*  I haven't heard it in like a real way because it doesn't seem conceivable and yet
*  This is such a weird playoffs that who the hell knows I was trying to walk through
*  I wanted to walk you through some what-ifs in the NBA playoffs and the biggest what-if for me
*  What if
*  LeBron wins three straight rounds and
*  Makes the finals what happens to our whole sports talk slash content universe if
*  LeBron makes one last run a la Brady on the books. I don't think it's gonna happen
*  They're like almost four to one underdogs against the Nuggets. I think the Nuggets are gonna beat them, but
*  What if how does it play out does he win?
*  these series
*  Like cleanly or are there injuries or weird things doesn't matter
*  I mean does it do you remember who Brady beat heading to the Super Bowl because I don't I
*  Don't remember any of the playoff games at this point. It was two three years ago
*  I don't know where they'd like like an aging drew Brees in there. Yeah. Yeah, it's like once two years pass nobody remembers
*  So if he makes it I'll answer your question with a question
*  Because we talked about how unfair
*  The expectations for 39 year old the brawn are
*  Do you think that if he made it all the way to the finals knocked off the reigning champs and it's Lakers
*  Celtics, let's say and he loses
*  against a
*  Historically good margin of victory Celtics team that people would actually hold that against him that the silver medal
*  Would actually be bad for his legacy even though he would do something
*  Absolutely amazing. I like that. He somehow loses even though something incredible happened. I don't I think if he made the finals
*  He would have to go through
*  Denver and
*  The yolk edge Murray combo and a team that people think is built to win multiple titles
*  I love the cheese. He would then have to beat the winner of Phoenix, Minnesota
*  So either you're beating to rant book or Beale or you're beating that Minnesota team that feels like you're away
*  The thing is I actually like that they got Denver first because you got to play him anyway
*  Why not try to throw a haymaker at him right away? Denver hasn't played for a week
*  who knows you flip it game six is in LA and so meet it Minnesota Phoenix would be second and
*  then the last series would be I guess a
*  Wait a second. Am I doing this right? Yeah, I'm doing this right because then the last series would be
*  Okc Dallas and
*  Clippers to the one of those three whoever is left
*  Mm-hmm. So like we know the Lakers can beat okc. That's the one team on positive. They can beat they have too much size. Yep
*  Clippers, let's say the Clippers somehow beat Dallas
*  But then what are the odds of Kawhi making it for a month and a half of basketball probably slim?
*  So that there is a scenario where this could happen and I do feel like
*  This is his last chance to shift the goat debate because everybody's already in their camps
*  There's really nothing else can happen at this point people could be like Michael Jordan's the best player ever but Lebron had the best career ever
*  That's kind of where people are gonna land. That's like a nice middle ground, but nobody's mad at nobody's mad at that middle ground
*  But if he somehow makes the finals and then I mean if he won the title, I think that swing that swings the debate
*  I think that would swing the debate like a five
*  Five rings versus six rings you'd be like well
*  I'll give it to the guy with five just because of the longevity and breadth of his career
*  Yeah, one ring away. He basically played like eight more years than Jordan. It just opens up
*  So much content and it's kind of amazing. It's in play
*  Do you really think so? I think Denver's gonna win. I do too. I think they're done immediately. I just think they're cooked
*  He hasn't won in Denver in four years
*  Four calendar years is the last game he won in Denver. So Denver takes care of home court
*  I don't see a path. I am wagering on Denver
*  I think they're gonna win but I will say Denver and I know you and I are probably the highest on Denver during the year
*  Like you were doing your
*  Denver nobody's beating them in a seven game series gimmick. I just think they're gonna win
*  I
*  Think we're the highest you can be on a team and yet last six weeks. There was some
*  Some holes in the boat. There were some execution stuff in the last parts of some games that was atypical for them
*  They just started losing games. They normally won which was the one thing
*  I always felt like this is the thing they have they don't if they if you let them hang around
*  They win they win in the last four minutes. That's who they are and then all of a sudden they can't inbound the ball
*  Yeah, all of a sudden Kyrie's hitting 20-foot lefty shots against him
*  And I and then you know, they're they just lost a couple dumb games
*  Which wasn't typically them and then the Murray thing to the fact that played 59 games
*  They were clearly like super careful with him as as the season went along and were they being cautious or?
*  Something more so those are the things that worry me
*  with the nuggets
*  And then the Lakers piece of it just like let's be honest. They get a shitload of calls
*  They just do they get they get
*  More officiating help than anybody in the league because of the of the style they play and plus it's Lebron
*  And that's he's the guy now who's gonna get cause
*  I think they're a tough thing to play
*  Do you buy I tried to spin the Spurs loss into a positive like I used to like
*  And you can't just want everything this year
*  But I used to like losing the final game of like the big East Tournament leading into the tournament like that's the wakeup call
*  They needed don't take any team for granted. We can't inbound the ball the Spurs came all the way back
*  Let's lock in now. They beat
*  Memphis
*  Yeah now I think they want to sweep to although the Lakers now kind of I mean they are the underdogs
*  But now the Lakers feel like the little team that could when it used to be the reverse Mike Malone used to wear though
*  Where the underdogs no one believes in us?
*  Jacket, but now I think Darwin Ham can play that card. So
*  They could definitely play that stuff confident. I'm still confident
*  You know what you just laid out is the o7 paths. I wish they had lost the Monday night game against the Ravens theory
*  Yep, yep, they just lose that game and the whole season becomes way easier instead
*  It becomes this march to undefeated which by the time they got to the Super Bowl
*  The team was running on fumes in a lot of different ways the Giants take advantage of it
*  If you're just talking about I wish that team won the Super Bowl
*  They're better off losing that Monday night game. I forget there was two plays in the end zone
*  There's like a pass interference that kept it alive then they scored on the next but like just
*  They probably should have lost that game and it would have been everything easier
*  The one thing with that Spurs game
*  The Spurs just played really well. Like I felt like Denver was trying, you know
*  They if Murray missed a couple easy shots in the last minute
*  But they were executing and doing stuff and just a couple shots didn't go in and then all of a sudden you have Devontae Graham
*  Just in traffic fling a shot off the wrong foot that goes in so
*  The the the thing that if you're gonna if you're gonna say this is stupid the Lakers have no chance
*  The thing that was shocking to me about that New Orleans game I
*  Think it was the first time I've ever seen LeBron in a must-win game where somebody else was like out
*  Out-athleting him and overpowering him and now it makes sense because it's year 21 for him
*  Yeah, it wasn't it jarring to watch for like an hour there or it's like, oh my god
*  like he it was like watching rocky 3 like the first round when
*  Clut look clubbers just he Rockies never seen anything like it. He comes back to the corners
*  Oh, I can't keep him off me
*  That's what LeBron felt like as Zion's just like a battering ram like when he knocked him backwards on that charge or whatever
*  And LeBron I haven't seen him get up like that ever
*  You know in a real where he wasn't like trying to milk it for a call
*  So that was there was a little bit of hmm this guy's we kind of forget that he's a little older than maybe yeah the stats
*  You know the fact the fact that he's 39 he's going up against you know
*  The envy who's you know, I think Joker's gonna win the MVP and we're like, oh
*  This is this is a fair fight like not really now. It should easily be Denver, but he'll keep a minute
*  He plays so smart and he plays such like a good perfect mix of you know
*  He's still a great athlete, but he's played some he has some real old man basketball moves
*  Like he did up and under on Zion it's just like a move you would do like on your kids in the driveway
*  Like you've never seen this
*  So he he's just brilliant out there
*  So I think he's gonna get it he's gonna still keep them in it
*  But I also you know all of a sudden the the altitude I love to play the altitude card in Denver, too
*  Once you're going back and forth, it's a real thing
*  Yeah, and they let you know about it. So I still feel very confident. Although you called my prediction a gimmick
*  I still don't think any team's beating them
*  When you tweet the same thing 38 times, I think it becomes a gimmick. Well, hello, it's you know
*  Nike says just do it for 20 years. It's got to work. You're getting people's heads. I like this low energy
*  We're taping this before you do this show. I like I eat right now
*  I feel like I'm with like my homes just throwing the ball around like an hour before the game
*  Okay, you know what you don't want to peek now. You want to peek on live TV? I can feel it
*  So I used to do the pod when I was at ESPN
*  We did the pod and I was just like have my feet up
*  There was no video involved and I was very chill and then I listened to the last pod we did I was like in TV mode
*  So you bring it back. I like you see you study yourself
*  Yeah, I had to watch the tape. I watched the all-too of just me and you I'm like, oh wow
*  Do you're a little bit too fired up here bring it back. Maybe I'll maybe I'll ramp it up
*  I gotta watch this one. No, I like the energy now. I didn't don't let you know don't this is pod wilds not TV wilds
*  There's a what if with Zion because for an hour he became the Zion we've been waiting for for five years
*  There was a two-way game with him. He's rebounding. He was actually like really defending and it was
*  Pretty much the most exciting non-wimpy moment of the season
*  I think yeah, and it felt like they were gonna win now
*  he's hurt and I just wonder like I know everybody talked about this history, but I just wonder is that like
*  The ultimate microcosm of his career or should we be enthused it's like maybe
*  You know, we gave him so much shit in December for the in-season tournament
*  Which he deserved because he was out of shape and overweight. He just was it was December. There was no excuse for it
*  He he shed the weight. He got in shape. He really played well down the stretch
*  Sunday got his ass kicked by the Lakers
*  And then responds in the playing game with this incredible game and it was like this is this is the guy we
*  this is why we were so excited in 2019 then he gets hurt and
*  So I just I hope that's not the 30 for 30 where this is like the best moment of 30 for 30
*  And it's like we go to commercial and come back and it's like and then that's when things turned
*  So I mean glass half full it's just a hamstring. So it's nothing bad
*  You know, he'll be able to bounce back from that next year he played 70 games the thing that I liked most
*  Besides him just you know looking awesome. Yeah is that other Lakers game?
*  I think he took 13 shots or 12 shots and he took 27 the other night
*  Like you just be the man like it's almost part of him
*  He just needs someone to like gas him up before every game like hey, by the way, you're fantastic
*  You're a great player take the game over and then he rolls to the occasion
*  That's what I like besides just hey the shots go in they don't go in but the fact that he wanted the ball and
*  Wanted to take it to the Lakers and I'll play everybody's great. So I really wanted to guard the prime that part
*  Yeah, I love the the downhill stuff Zion was doing and watching LeBron
*  Have actual fear which look if it was 2013 LeBron, it's different
*  I don't I don't think he's backpedaling as I am coming at him, but it was still just
*  You know, we spend so much time with these guys I get old we watched it happen to Brady
*  where there were just some moments and some of those later year Brady games when it was he just
*  Was just dumping the ball to get rid of it because he didn't want to get hit
*  You know, you just you hit a different point in your career, but it was weird to see LeBron as the athlete
*  I mean the only other person I think in the last ten years who could have probably overpowered him was
*  Was Yannis but they never
*  Really played a big game against each other, you know
*  So, you know they had like ABC game shit like that
*  But not like real stakes like what we had the other night. So was it I to me it was like wow
*  It almost made me appreciate the LeBron era more because it's like wow
*  I took I took for granted that he was always the most overpowering person in any game
*  You know, especially as he got older and he would just start
*  Kind of barreling to the basket whenever he wanted which is a skill he still has this year
*  But it was just weird to see him backpedaling the drafted 16 years apart
*  Yeah, and but they felt like peers in a way. I mean there's also the idea that LeBron
*  Or he said some very complimentary things about Zion after the game, but part of me does think that
*  he's still like
*  He's not giving the torch to anybody and it felt like oh maybe Zion will take the torch from LeBron
*  that was a conversation that I still think the media has moved on from but maybe he keeps in his
*  sort of
*  Inspiration file or grudge file that he has to open a trial the grudge of LeBron's grudge file every once in a while
*  Yes, we like the Sean Stevenson. No, and he just keeps on going. He's like, oh, yeah Zion will take the league over from
*  That it's under W
*  Oh Z's it's I know it's back here. So that's I forgot to put last name. Yeah
*  I'm waiting for LeBron to just embrace Wemby as like the next guy
*  I think that's the best move for him because it can't really happen till after
*  LeBron's out of basketball basically when
*  Wemby will hit the things he can say he called it when it happened and then if Wemby gets hurt
*  Which is possible because seven foot five then you say well would it happen?
*  I just think there's no losses for LeBron just kind of anointing him as the next guy plus it pisses off everybody else
*  It's the good move. I like that
*  I'll buy that I like I also like LeBron going somewhere else after this year
*  Maybe not after this year, but eventually do you think he's retiring in a Lakers Jersey? I
*  Think everything's in play like if they get their asses kicked by Denver. Yeah in a weird way
*  We spend so much time talking about the Lakers
*  But yet there's stuff with this series that is you know, there's so much good
*  There's so many good storylines with Brown one and this series
*  Has some like really juicy subplots including what happens if they just get their asses kicked. Thank you
*  I tried to you know find the current I pitched this story today in the show and everybody got mad at
*  Because oh wow, I'm already I'm like, hey, do we want to do what happens if this goes south for the Lakers?
*  Me LeBron is like no we can't go past the series wilds. Okay, it would be good and we all know
*  There is a scenario where?
*  They get their asses kicked
*  Dallas let's say Dallas makes the Western Finals
*  Maybe Dallas makes the finals who knows?
*  Yeah, Dallas drafts his son with like the 44th pick or they buy some pick or whatever
*  They're like we we now have your son. It's like almost like it's like basketball taken
*  with Liam Neeson we have your son
*  Son no, and now all of a sudden he's playing in Dallas with Luca because I do think if he switches teams
*  We talked about this before in the pub
*  But if he switches teams it has to be for a title and to play with this son the combo
*  it has to be a contender and
*  The chance to play with this son. That's the only way it makes sense. Otherwise he stays here, but I don't think he's done. I mean
*  No his shooting got better and there was a good Chris Herring wrote a good piece about why like how he
*  Subtly changed some of his mechanics
*  So I think for the fact that his three-point shots better
*  I think he can go longer
*  But just the fact that they're in the conversation with the Nuggets and that line isn't like Nuggets minus 800
*  It's pretty impressive and they do have you you could say two the three best players in the series. I would personally
*  For the playoffs
*  Probably put Murray and Davis even because playoff Jamal is
*  Incredible and Davis every game you think he's just gonna limp off at any point
*  But you could make a case they have to three, but they have two all NBA players in the series Denver has won
*  Yeah, yeah playoff Jamal. I think but you know three four and five. I'd almost get
*  to the Denver I
*  Think everybody's average in 20-point I think in these game in the last three games they played I think everyone's average in 20 points
*  I think Michael Porter's average in 20 point and Casey peas average in 20 points
*  Maybe Casey Pli only played one game, but area I think it's more far more balanced than anybody thinks even though we we are always focusing on
*  On Jamal. Well, there's one more storyline that you're gonna make the wild space not want to comment on but
*  Them catching Denver around one right after Michael Porter Jr's brother was involved in the biggest gambling scandal in 60 years
*  It's not nothing guys his brother like that. Yeah, that's not affecting him like
*  I took I took the opposite take on that. I think that's a fair question like does that is
*  that in his head or is like
*  Do you subscribe to the you know the basketball is my escape once I'm in between the lines
*  I get I'm totally locked in here and there are no
*  effects
*  Kind I kind of subscribe to that and not like I I can't hit my open jump shots because my brother got banned from
*  The league but I could see if it goes south that's gonna be a storyline
*  You mean when I hosted the first episode the Grandland basketball or even though I was coming off a three-week suspension
*  I didn't let it affect me. It's a good show. You were locked in I was locked in in fact
*  You were better. I was like I felt like I was zoned in
