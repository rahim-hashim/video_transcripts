# 2025 NBA Trade Value Rankings With Ryen Russillo | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc)
*  Ryan Rosillo is here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=0.0s)]
*  It's been a while for us. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1.16s)]
*  Once, uh, once we get through football season, we're going to be doing Sunday [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2.4s)]
*  nights again, talking hoops and a whole bunch of other stuff, but I'm bringing [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  you in right now, we're still low as the trade value list, conciliary, a thing [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=9.0s)]
*  that I have not been doing for 25 years, a quarter of a century, the trade values [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  list, which is not a rankings. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=18.84s)]
*  It's a trade asset list, trying to figure out who the biggest trade asset. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=21.06s)]
*  In the MBAs, but before we do that, um, what, what side are you on in Jimmy Butler [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=25.44s)]
*  versus Miami, do we have to pick a side? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=29.8s)]
*  Is this where you just have to go one side or the other? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=33.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  Um, I like to have an open mind about a lot of things, but I think deep down [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=36.68s)]
*  my core, I know I probably already know which direction I'm going, but he just [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=41.32s)]
*  wanted the contract that he's not getting. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=46.2s)]
*  So what, I mean, unless there was a promise, I mean, everybody knows [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=47.6s)]
*  Harden's not my favorite guy, but I kind of sided with Harden on the end of the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=50.56s)]
*  Philly thing, cause why would he have taken the pay cut? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=55.16s)]
*  Why would he have done everything he had done? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  And then it's like, and I know Philly's going to say nothing was ever [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=60.44s)]
*  agreed upon, you're totally wrong. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=63.559999999999995s)]
*  All right, that's fine. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=64.9s)]
*  But he did something that didn't really make a ton of sense at the time to allow [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  flexibility than anything to get a deal. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=68.92s)]
*  So on that one, I was like, well, even though I'm not definitive either way, I [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=70.44s)]
*  can understand him being upset with this one. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=73.8s)]
*  I mean, do, have you heard anything that you believe that's probably [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=75.92s)]
*  the important second part? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=79.44s)]
*  Have you heard anything that you believe that would let you think that Miami [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=80.84s)]
*  would have been in a hurry to extend somebody like Butler who's 35 and misses [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=84.84s)]
*  a lot of games and had a contract for this year and a player option for next year? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  I think that's the unusual part about it is that there was real years on the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=94.16000000000001s)]
*  book left. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=98.48s)]
*  I, I really feel like I want to pick a side, but I kind of see both sides. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=99.12s)]
*  Cause what's Butler side. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=103.88000000000001s)]
*  Give me the anti Miami heat side. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=105.64s)]
*  I think Butler's side is his relationship has been bad with the heat for a couple [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=108.2s)]
*  of years and he took them to the finals in 2000 and 2023. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=113.2s)]
*  And I think at some point he felt like, you know, I brought you guys here. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=117.4s)]
*  You guys tried to embarrass me in the press conference last year. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=121.12s)]
*  You won't talk about an extension. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=124.8s)]
*  You obviously don't care if I'm here two years from now. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  So what's the point of this? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=128.4s)]
*  With that said, I don't think he's handled it well either. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, I think a lot of us, including me and you have been in, you know, some [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=134.0s)]
*  pretty hairy professional situations where you ended up not liking people you [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=139.0s)]
*  worked with or the employer you had. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=144.0s)]
*  And at some point you still have to kind of do your job. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=145.76s)]
*  And I think that's where it's tough to side with him on the Miami side. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=148.76s)]
*  Um, they Riley just seems like he's tried to antagonize him and, and alpha dog him [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=152.36s)]
*  in a bunch of different ways in ways that if you knew anything about Jimmy Butler, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=159.16s)]
*  it's like you get on this road and there's no going back. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=162.4s)]
*  So I see both sides, but I will say this. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=165.36s)]
*  They, he's, they torpedoed his trade value at this point. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=169.16s)]
*  I mean, I think you could just get him now for two expirings and they're like, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=172.36s)]
*  good, take them because they're so worried he's going to opt into next year. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=175.32s)]
*  The start of the season, I was thinking Houston should do Amen Thompson and Van [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=178.48s)]
*  Vleet and let's go all in and try. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=183.24s)]
*  I mean, we'll talk about Amen Thompson later, but to think like that, that was [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=185.6s)]
*  maybe an argument at the beginning of the season versus where we are now, where [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=190.48s)]
*  it's like, ah, would Detroit give up Tobias Harris and Tim Hardaway for Butler? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=194.16s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=198.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=199.2s)]
*  Tobias is playing pretty well. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=199.68s)]
*  Like that's where we're at with this Butler thing, which is insane. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=200.88s)]
*  You might be right about that. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=205.36s)]
*  And I think there's, there's a bunch of different things there that I like. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=206.48s)]
*  Um, I've never been special enough, uh, to compare myself with Jimmy Butler. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=208.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=212.72s)]
*  Like I, and I'm not, I'm not saying this because whatever our dynamic is, but [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=213.0s)]
*  your career, like, I think at times you have been special enough to probably get [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=217.16s)]
*  away with that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=220.24s)]
*  We don't have to, I'm not comparing ourselves to him in that way. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=221.36s)]
*  I'm just comparing like what it's like to work for somebody when you're really [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=224.2s)]
*  frustrated with them. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=228.32s)]
*  And he's way more frustrated, I think, than either of us have ever been with [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=229.48s)]
*  anyone we worked with. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=232.28s)]
*  Like he's doing shit, but he's doing stuff that he's doing stuff that, uh, you [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=233.44s)]
*  know, that's, that's just seems like he's trying to sabotage everything. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=240.56s)]
*  Well, right. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=245.2s)]
*  When the first quote came out, when this thing first got picked up, it was like, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=245.6s)]
*  Jimmy hasn't even started yet. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=249.64s)]
*  Which, which I was like, yeah, because we know the deal. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=251.79999999999998s)]
*  Um, you know, I think a lot of this stuff is like personal equity where [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=255.32s)]
*  like Tim Duncan ever had a problem with anything. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=258.64s)]
*  I think we'd all immediately take Tim Duncan's side. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=260.68s)]
*  I guess just go, Whoa, like Tim Duncan's upset about something. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=263.12s)]
*  And with Butler, even though I think there's a, there's a version of the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=266.8s)]
*  Chicago events where I would understand him. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=270.12s)]
*  I thought the Wiggins towns thing at the time was funny. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=272.8s)]
*  Cause I don't think he was wrong. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=275.24s)]
*  Philadelphia decided to go with the young guys. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=276.88s)]
*  So, you know, every exit there's some drama, but with this, there's another [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=279.8s)]
*  part of this that is just the reality of what's happening, this new CBA. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=284.12s)]
*  When we first talked about it, you're like, man, this kind of looks like a hard cap. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=287.36s)]
*  This, this looks like there's really limited flexibility. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=290.72s)]
*  I think another motivation behind some of this was that, Hey, guess what? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=294.2s)]
*  If you have a four year extension about to kick in and you want to ask for a [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=298.16s)]
*  trade and you want to ask for a trade to like one team, that's already pretty good. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=302.44s)]
*  We're going to set up something that not only curb spending, which is the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=306.92s)]
*  primary motivation behind this, but we're also going to make it really hard for [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=310.04s)]
*  you guys to decide like, sorry, I'm just out of here now and you have to do this. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=314.32s)]
*  And I think that a lot of star players, it's becoming a wake up call. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=319.56s)]
*  And when you're 35 and you miss a lot of games and your personal history is that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=323.76s)]
*  it ends up in some sort of bullshit thing. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=327.96000000000004s)]
*  That's a distraction for the basketball team. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=330.44s)]
*  Like no kidding. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=332.04s)]
*  There's not a great market for him. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=333.32s)]
*  Well, you think like he, in the old days, I want to go to Phoenix. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=335.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=338.92s)]
*  How are we? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=339.44s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=340.44s)]
*  They spent three weeks now. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=341.32s)]
*  It's like, yeah, you're not going to Phoenix. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=342.48s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=345.36s)]
*  We're not taking Bradley Beale. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  We're not. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=347.64s)]
*  There's no scenario where we take them. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=348.8s)]
*  Nobody else is taking them. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=350.6s)]
*  And on top of the Bradley Beale is a no trade clause. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=351.84000000000003s)]
*  So Phoenix is out. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=353.8s)]
*  Stop saying you want to go there. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=354.88s)]
*  Um, I think it's at the spite point where they just send them, you know, this last [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=356.84000000000003s)]
*  thing that happened this week, now it just seems like they don't even care. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=361.6s)]
*  They just want to get them out of there and try to move on. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=364.4s)]
*  I think it's gotten that bad. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=366.84s)]
*  So I don't know why they want to be another team. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=368.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=371.28s)]
*  I don't know why they'd want to be in the Jimmy Butler business. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=371.52s)]
*  I think I can't dispute the fact of like whatever the trademark it was for him [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=374.03999999999996s)]
*  versus now it's it's diminished because you're like, here we go again and it's [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=377.91999999999996s)]
*  all fresh and when it's actually happening and then you have to sit in their front [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=382.03999999999996s)]
*  office and your ownership and your coaches and go like, like I like the Memphis [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=385.03999999999996s)]
*  basketball part of it, but then when you hear the quote being like, don't send [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=388.79999999999995s)]
*  him to Memphis like anywhere but Memphis. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=392.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=395.2s)]
*  So if you're Memphis and you're like, Hey, we're pretty good. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=395.44s)]
*  We're not great, but we're pretty good. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  So yeah, he raises our top five ceiling, which I think a lot of teams just do [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  like, Hey, if these are the five guys are rolling out there to close the [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=403.76s)]
*  playoff game, this is better than the five we have right now. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=406.0s)]
*  It makes sense. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=408.72s)]
*  But if you're like, what if he opts in at 50 million and then he's 36 and we [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=409.36s)]
*  don't give him an extension? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=412.64s)]
*  So even though I, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=414.2s)]
*  there's not, there's only one team. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=416.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=418.64s)]
*  There's, well, you have to be desperate to do this. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=419.40000000000003s)]
*  And like taking, pushing the Detroit society and teams out like, Oh, it'd be [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=422.44s)]
*  fun if they got Jimmy Butler Golden State's the only team that's actually [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=426.04s)]
*  desperate Golden State is at an actual crossroads as a franchise, as an [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=429.0s)]
*  organization for the decade, you know, they're just not good enough. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=435.76s)]
*  And the stat that they're one in 20 heading into the fourth quarter when [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=440.2s)]
*  they're not winning to me, that's like, we got to go one way or the other guys. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=444.12s)]
*  Are we going to try to get better and do some sort of crazy all in [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=448.28s)]
*  trade or are we going to start going the other way and start trading off [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=451.16s)]
*  people and just tanking this season and throwing it away and do we go that way? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=454.40000000000003s)]
*  But right now they're in some middle ground and that's where like, you know, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=458.8s)]
*  if you and I are in the warrior's office with the Lake Oaks and the GM and they're [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=463.16s)]
*  like, what do you guys think at some point I'd be like, look, man, I think [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=466.56s)]
*  when Jimmy gets traded, he's going to be really good. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=470.48s)]
*  I think he's going to be possessed and you might get an awesome year out of him. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=472.88s)]
*  And this is the only way you could flip your destiny as a franchise. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=476.24s)]
*  You might be able to get this guy for 12 cents on the dollar and in a [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=479.52s)]
*  playoff series, nobody's going to want to see him. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=482.88s)]
*  Do you two years from now, do you care two years from now, you're going nowhere [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=485.4s)]
*  anyway, so that's the one team I think I could see and there's trades. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=488.64s)]
*  They have a bunch of contracts. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=492.56s)]
*  Wiggins would have to be in it, but that's the only one I see. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=493.76s)]
*  I just would be scared to death if I'm done, Levi and I'm Lake up and I'm going, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=499.03999999999996s)]
*  okay, so we bring them in everything you made sense that said made sense, but. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=502.32s)]
*  It was agents like, okay, so, you know, what do you think about tacking [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=506.76s)]
*  on those two years for him? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=510.24s)]
*  It's a no. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=512.32s)]
*  And so if it's a no, the bigger question is that just gone now based on how this [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=513.64s)]
*  year has gone like, Hey, his agent's Bernie Lee, who's a very nice guy. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=517.24s)]
*  Hey, Bernie, Jimmy's in every two years contract at this point. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=521.64s)]
*  That's just the way it is. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=524.96s)]
*  There's nobody in the league that's going to go for for him based on the behavior. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=526.16s)]
*  That's, that's what he's forfeited on the bright side. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=529.4s)]
*  If he's still really good every two years, he'll get an awesome contract. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=531.92s)]
*  I think he's in that James Harden kind of zone now where it's like, if he was 32, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=535.04s)]
*  he doesn't play enough for me. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=539.4s)]
*  It's a no. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=540.5999999999999s)]
*  And you're right about the basketball part of it, whether it's them, whether [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=541.3599999999999s)]
*  it's Memphis, cause it does raise your student, but if, if I have to sit there [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=544.8s)]
*  and be honest with the people that are in charge of my employment, right? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=548.76s)]
*  If you're working in the front office side of this, answering to your owner [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=552.64s)]
*  and going, yeah, let's just trust that it's going to work out with his track record. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=555.52s)]
*  I wouldn't feel good about saying yes to that. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=560.1199999999999s)]
*  I would just go like, look at prop. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=561.8399999999999s)]
*  It'd be one thing if he was younger and you go, Hey, maybe the West isn't, and [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=563.68s)]
*  it isn't as deep or doesn't feel as deep halfway through the seasons. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=567.28s)]
*  We thought it would be the summer. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=569.9599999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=571.4799999999999s)]
*  See still looks like a monster. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=571.8s)]
*  I mean, we can run through every team and I could tell you concerns I have [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=573.28s)]
*  about all the contenders, but it would have to be more of like a guarantee of [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=575.7199999999999s)]
*  what's possible and even adding him doesn't like, what does it actually [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=579.9599999999999s)]
*  guarantee about what Golden State can do in the playoffs? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=583.1999999999999s)]
*  The only reason you do it is cause you love Curry. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=585.8399999999999s)]
*  You feel like you owe it to him to at least be competitive for a couple of [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=588.84s)]
*  rounds and this is a way to honor that. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=592.16s)]
*  That's it. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=595.44s)]
*  You're not beating, you're not winning four straight playoff rounds with [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=596.28s)]
*  or without Jimmy Butler. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=599.28s)]
*  I don't think. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=600.52s)]
*  Let me, let me throw something at you here. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=602.2s)]
*  Cause you mentioned it with the Riley thing and they felt like really [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=603.84s)]
*  betrayed by Riley being upset when Butler was basically like, if I was [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=606.64s)]
*  playing, we'd beat Boston, we'd beat the next, by the way, they weren't beating [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=611.72s)]
*  that Boston team last year or last year. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=615.08s)]
*  No, no chance. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=617.12s)]
*  So it was kind of a crazy thing. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=618.28s)]
*  And then I think about like Riley's age. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=620.16s)]
*  He's the same age as my dad. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=621.6s)]
*  I'm like, imagine if my dad had to do a press conference about a player. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=622.8s)]
*  I'm so glad you brought this up. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=627.0799999999999s)]
*  Riley's old. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=628.48s)]
*  Like, Hey, he's acting erratically, which makes sense. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=629.4s)]
*  Cause he's like 80, 80 year olds are erratic. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=632.24s)]
*  I went to go see Gillis and Bill Burr last night for the fire benefit. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=635.4s)]
*  And Gillis had this whole routine of like, you know, Biden didn't [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=639.56s)]
*  really get enough credit. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=643.52s)]
*  Like imagine, imagine if you had someone in your family who was 84, who had to [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=645.0s)]
*  like go out there and speak to the world. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=649.6400000000001s)]
*  It actually could have been that much worse. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=652.6s)]
*  Now look, Riley at no point do I think like what's going on with this guy, but [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=654.6400000000001s)]
*  he deserves like Riley's done enough in his basketball life to have this stance. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=660.44s)]
*  And then when I think about like how other teams operate and everybody [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=664.6800000000001s)]
*  operates an absolute fear where they have to, when their best player goes off, they [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=667.08s)]
*  have to find some way through PR to craft some way that they're supportive. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=671.64s)]
*  But it's like, so what, so what happened? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=675.52s)]
*  What if Riley had said nothing? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=677.12s)]
*  The bottom line is that they didn't give him the contract extension. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=678.84s)]
*  They'd probably be in the exact same place. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=681.1999999999999s)]
*  So like, you can tell me that it was insulting or that that was the thing that [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=683.04s)]
*  I don't, when he didn't get the extension, when he felt like he was owed this, like [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=686.8s)]
*  why, cause you went to the finals two years ago, which was like really fluky. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=690.84s)]
*  And what five years ago last year, which is, and he doesn't play. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=695.12s)]
*  He doesn't play enough. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=699.8s)]
*  And look, when he was playing this year, you could see. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=701.0799999999999s)]
*  You're like, what's going on with him? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=705.16s)]
*  Like before this even got like publicly bad and it's like, so you want the [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=706.92s)]
*  extension, but you're going to mail it in for stretches. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=711.16s)]
*  Hey, I almost feel like he's coasting until the trade. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=714.36s)]
*  And when he gets traded to wherever he's going to unleash Holy hell, that's why [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=717.4s)]
*  the Detroit option is so fascinating to me for him, because that's it. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=720.48s)]
*  That's a team that would actually need him. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=725.0s)]
*  That's the team that just wants to be good, relevant in some way. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=726.88s)]
*  And that's a team that has a really, really good player, you know, and they [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=729.84s)]
*  bring some things to the table. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=733.12s)]
*  They're pretty well coached. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=734.36s)]
*  Um, he raises their ceiling in a way that I think is intriguing. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=736.0s)]
*  They're not going to win the title with them. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=741.2s)]
*  And I think that's why we're, whoever is trading for him is not a team that he [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=742.6s)]
*  can win the title with. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=746.64s)]
*  And I think that's another reality of this. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=747.52s)]

*  Even if, even if Miami was like, all right, fine, we'll take Porter and we'll [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=751.52s)]
*  take Zeke Naji for four years, you can have Butler. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=755.76s)]
*  I don't know if that changes Denver's ceiling, like they're to have enough [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=758.5200000000001s)]
*  outside shooting problems, you know? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=762.0400000000001s)]
*  Um, if they were playing worse, I might think about it, but I actually really [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=764.32s)]
*  like the way they're playing, even though they lost last night. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=767.72s)]
*  Um, we'll see what happens. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=770.0400000000001s)]
*  You're totally ruling out Phoenix. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=772.2s)]
*  I don't think anyone wants Beal. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=775.0s)]
*  And even if they wanted Beal, I don't know if he would agree to go to the trade, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=776.9200000000001s)]
*  but I, I watched the game last night. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=780.0400000000001s)]
*  Like, I just don't think Beal's good. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=781.8000000000001s)]
*  He's fine. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=784.5600000000001s)]
*  Like he's, he's a rotation guy, but for 50 million a year, that's the [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=785.28s)]
*  worst contract in the league. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=788.64s)]
*  What am I going to, and he doesn't play every time. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=790.16s)]
*  You know, I think there's a reason like, like Phoenix has tried to move away [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=792.8s)]
*  from that big three model with him. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=798.32s)]
*  And I think there's a reason everybody is like, yeah, no thanks. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=800.84s)]
*  Cool. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=804.48s)]
*  Oh, I get Bradley Beal this year and the next two. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=805.2s)]
*  No thanks. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=807.08s)]
*  Like everyone throws Chicago and you know, could he go to Milwaukee? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=807.8s)]
*  Why would Milwaukee want Bradley Beal? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=811.4s)]
*  They're going to have him and Dame at the same time. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=813.36s)]
*  Trying to play defense. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=815.24s)]
*  That that's crazy. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=816.8s)]
*  I just can't find a team for him either. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=819.48s)]
*  I guess I just wonder why Phoenix would flip the unprotected 2031 for these [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=821.5600000000001s)]
*  other pieces without some inclination of what's possible for him before the [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=827.0s)]
*  deadline, unless it was just, Hey, we're all in now, like when you have to rant, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=830.64s)]
*  you're all in. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=836.2s)]
*  So is Beal better than mid-level players? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=837.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=840.76s)]
*  He's really low on what the actual acquisition. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=842.0s)]
*  Can I stop you for a second? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=845.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=846.24s)]
*  That trade was horrible. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=847.12s)]
*  That was the all time. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=849.8s)]
*  We took a $2 bill and turned it into three quarters and a dime because it [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=851.04s)]
*  gives us more flexibility. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=856.04s)]
*  It's like, that's a team that they're at the blackjack table losing hand [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=857.4s)]
*  after hand going, give me more. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=861.64s)]
*  I'm going to double down. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=863.1999999999999s)]
*  Oh, you're kidding. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=864.12s)]
*  Can I borrow your chips? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=864.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=865.5999999999999s)]
*  The actual Phoenix trade that you're acting like Phoenix is a rational team [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=866.56s)]
*  that puts thought into the shit they do. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=869.88s)]
*  That trade was idiotic. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=871.36s)]
*  I'm not trading that. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=873.52s)]
*  They have nothing because they have nothing and they're already all in with [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=874.28s)]
*  this group. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=878.52s)]
*  I think the argument is that, well, like, what are we doing? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=879.12s)]
*  We're, we're going to hold onto assets in 2031. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=882.4s)]
*  Like we have to find any possible way to upgrade this group because once you did [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=885.3199999999999s)]
*  the Durant trade, this is, this is how you are operating. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=890.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=894.1999999999999s)]
*  But at that point you're Tim Daly's character in the Sopranos, the screenwriter [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=894.36s)]
*  who's on the 48 hour gambling binge, just getting killed. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=898.12s)]
*  And he's like, just give me 25 grand more. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=901.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm going to win this back. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=902.64s)]
*  That's Phil. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=903.96s)]
*  That's Phoenix and there should be a right now. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=904.9200000000001s)]
*  Just give me, let's split the picks up. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=906.76s)]
*  We'll have some flexibility. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=908.48s)]
*  We'll try to win this back. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=909.36s)]
*  It's like this ship has sailed. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=910.4s)]
*  You're not, you're not doing anything and you're not getting Jimmy Butler for what [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=912.48s)]
*  you have. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=915.32s)]
*  And if, if anyone takes Bradley Beale and allows you to get Jimmy Butler, I can't [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=915.72s)]
*  imagine a team in the league that's dumb enough. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=920.2s)]
*  Maybe I'll be wrong. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=922.0s)]
*  Maybe they'll cut this clip out and be like, zoom in. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=922.84s)]
*  So do it. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=924.6s)]
*  Like, I don't see why anybody would want Bradley Beale 50 million this year, 50 [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=925.0400000000001s)]
*  million the next two in the second apron era. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=928.84s)]
*  Who wants that? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=932.24s)]
*  I'd be fascinated to know like what he would actually wave his no trade clause [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=933.5600000000001s)]
*  for, because this is somebody who actually didn't go to Washington the entire time [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=938.1600000000001s)]
*  they lost. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=942.08s)]
*  Like we kept waiting for that to happen. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=942.52s)]
*  And then I remember hearing that he's probably just going to wait until he can [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=944.0400000000001s)]
*  get that five year extension with them is the incumbent team. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=948.4000000000001s)]
*  And he is okay with just kind of being there. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=951.96s)]
*  And then I wonder if Beale goes, you think I'm upset about coming off the bench? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=956.2s)]
*  You think I'm upset about taking 13 shots a game? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=960.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=962.76s)]
*  I like, I like it here. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=963.1999999999999s)]
*  I like Phoenix. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=964.6s)]
*  My family likes Phoenix. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=965.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=967.4399999999999s)]
*  You can't, you can't humiliate me. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=967.64s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=969.92s)]
*  I was, I stayed with the wizards for years on purpose. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=971.64s)]
*  You think this bugs me? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=975.0799999999999s)]
*  I just called my accountant. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=976.48s)]
*  I just can't believe how much money I'm going to make the rest of the year. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=977.72s)]
*  I'm fine. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=981.24s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=982.52s)]
*  So the trade value rules really quickly. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=982.76s)]
*  It's not, this is not a top hundred list. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=985.48s)]
*  This has to do with age of the players, salaries, mattering contract, length, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=987.8s)]
*  happiness and degrees. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=993.28s)]
*  Right? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=995.0s)]
*  So it's, if you're talking about, um, one player that's 35 versus an up and [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=995.3199999999999s)]
*  comic star, that's 23 as crazy. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1000.92s)]
*  I'm on Thompson's a good example. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1003.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1005.4s)]
*  I'm on Thompson for Kevin Durant. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1006.12s)]
*  If it was just this year, maybe you'd want Kevin Durant for the playoff run, but [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1007.76s)]
*  big picture as an asset for your team for age, rookie contract, the whole thing. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1012.48s)]
*  You'd want to, I'm on Thompson. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1017.92s)]
*  You'd want to be in the business of him for the next 15 years. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1019.2s)]
*  So that's a good way to think about it. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1021.88s)]
*  It's also a great name just to interrupt quickly, because after last night, I was [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1024.08s)]
*  like, will he have a man in his top 10? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1027.76s)]
*  Well, here's the thing. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1031.36s)]
*  So I've been working on this list for two weeks and there was a version of it a [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1032.44s)]
*  couple of days ago where I had him 20 and I emailed it to a friend of mine and I [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1037.04s)]
*  was like, does anything jump out? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1041.04s)]
*  And he's like, Jesus, you have Thompson that high? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1042.56s)]
*  And I'm like, I actually do. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1046.0s)]
*  Like, I don't know if you've watched the last four weeks, but what's happening [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1048.3999999999999s)]
*  here is, is really, really, really crazy. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1052.32s)]
*  The athleticism, the defense, the rebounding, the fact that he's starting to [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1055.72s)]
*  figure out how to create his own shot, how to beat guys off the dribble. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1060.2s)]
*  He didn't tell him in the game in Boston last night. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1063.24s)]
*  Like what happened in Boston last night? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1065.12s)]
*  Wasn't like, oh my God, what a great game. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1067.12s)]
*  Like he's been moving this way for five weeks and he's the best asset on that [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1068.8799999999999s)]
*  team and it's not close. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1073.28s)]
*  I think he's an automatic hangup. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1075.1599999999999s)]
*  If you call Houston now, they don't need, they're like, what? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1076.8s)]
*  No, we're not trading him. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1079.52s)]
*  They hang up. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1080.4799999999998s)]
*  This is a compliment, but imagine when he's good. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1082.0s)]
*  Great. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1086.0s)]
*  Imagine when they could shoot threes. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1086.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1087.84s)]
*  And I don't know if he's, he's going to be like somebody you're really worried [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1088.56s)]
*  about, but there are things that he's doing. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1091.8s)]
*  Like he was even the last, again, you're right. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1093.8799999999999s)]
*  It wasn't just about last night against Boston. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1096.12s)]
*  You're looking at these rebounding numbers, but also, and I like it, even [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1098.3999999999999s)]
*  though it doesn't look great, like they're letting him get into kind of a [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1101.8s)]
*  pull-up jumper and it doesn't look very good, but I like that they're allowing [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1104.32s)]
*  him or they would want him to make those mistakes because you're never going to [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1109.68s)]
*  develop any of that stuff. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1113.1599999999999s)]
*  You're never going to become the best version of yourself, the most well-rounded [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1114.2s)]
*  if you're afraid to do that stuff in game. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1116.72s)]
*  Like it's the old Ben Simmons thing where it's like cool videos, bro. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1118.8799999999999s)]
*  But you don't do any of those things that you show us in practice. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1121.84s)]
*  Cause you just, you've eliminated those from your arsenal because [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1125.72s)]
*  you're just not comfortable. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1128.56s)]
*  And I love to see young players, especially somebody who was raw as him. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1129.92s)]
*  And when you did the draft work on him, you're like, man, he's such an insane [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1133.0800000000002s)]
*  athlete and this is why people draft guys like this and then they get, yeah, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1135.96s)]
*  being like, oh, they just drafted the athlete and you're like, yeah, but this [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1139.28s)]
*  is, this is the version of like the best case scenario of like, if this guy ever [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1141.68s)]
*  figures it out with his gifts and the fact that he's like a 1% athlete, I want [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1145.4s)]
*  him making some of those mistakes. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1150.92s)]
*  I want him pulling up off the dribble and maybe taking an ugly jumper right now. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1152.8400000000001s)]
*  Because the only way it's ever going to get better is when he's confident enough [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1157.0400000000002s)]
*  to actually apply some of this stuff in game. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1161.0s)]
*  So it was, when you sent me the list this morning, it was the first name I was [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1162.6000000000001s)]
*  looking for because the question is how high should he be? [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1166.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1171.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1171.8000000000002s)]
*  You called him a 1% athlete. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1172.0s)]
*  I think he's like a 0.1% athlete. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1174.0s)]
*  I think you're the best ever do it. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1177.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1179.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm just like, I don't like I just think athletically he's on some rare plane [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1180.2s)]
*  that only a few guys I've seen have been at. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1186.68s)]
*  Like when we're talking like young Kawhi, young Pippen, Westbrook, Derrick [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1190.1200000000001s)]
*  Rose, those early years, MJ obviously there's, it's like a very small list. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1194.64s)]
*  And he's on it. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1199.24s)]
*  And you saw some of the stuff he was doing on both ends last night. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1199.92s)]
*  Like even Tatum going by him and getting, you know, layups or shots he wants. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1202.5600000000002s)]
*  Thompson's always almost there. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1207.0800000000002s)]
*  Like he almost blocks it. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1209.1200000000001s)]
*  Like he, he really has to work to get by him. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1210.6000000000001s)]
*  I just love watching him play. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1213.6000000000001s)]
*  And I think the thing that is probably so hard to figure out when he, where [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1214.92s)]
*  was he, overtime elite? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1218.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1220.48s)]
*  How do you figure out the competitiveness piece for a kid who's like 17 [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1222.0s)]
*  playing in some goofy league? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1225.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1227.3600000000001s)]
*  The thing that's great about him is how like relentlessly competitive he is. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1227.76s)]
*  Like I just, I'm such a huge fan and for whatever reason Jabari got hurt. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1232.1200000000001s)]
*  They went a little smaller with him. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1237.5600000000002s)]
*  It unlocked something. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1239.28s)]
*  And now if I were them, I wouldn't trade for anybody. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1240.64s)]
*  You know, they're a two seed. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1243.5600000000002s)]
*  They've had some big wins this week. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1244.52s)]
*  I, I, I wouldn't mess with this. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1245.8799999999999s)]
*  Just let's get, let's see how far we can go. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1248.16s)]
*  Let's keep pushing Thompson a little bit. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1251.4s)]
*  Let's nudge and see really what's their short term, long term. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1253.92s)]
*  And next year we'll figure it out or the summer. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1258.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1260.8s)]
*  I think that's the move because the, the Wednesday had this week, you really have [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1261.32s)]
*  to start thinking, yeah, but what if they did, what if they did this? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1265.52s)]
*  Could they like make the finals? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1269.92s)]
*  We've seen teams like out of nowhere and we've argued about this in [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1271.6399999999999s)]
*  the past, if you have a chance to make the finals, how far do you go in this [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1274.36s)]
*  case, I'd probably wait because I think all their flexibility comes this summer. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1278.3999999999999s)]
*  Once they can trade those Shangoon and Jalen green deals. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1282.76s)]
*  And so you, you want to know heading into the summer, what to do. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1285.4399999999998s)]
*  The other thing about this trademark, it is just the hit list of guys. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1289.7199999999998s)]
*  I'm not a huge fan of. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1293.04s)]
*  Like it really is. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1294.3999999999999s)]
*  That's rumor. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1295.7199999999998s)]
*  So Jimmy's the only one. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1297.7199999999998s)]
*  If, if I knew he was bought in, I go, okay, you know, let's, let's do this. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1300.52s)]
*  And you can figure out like where he fits in. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1305.7199999999998s)]
*  Cause as much as they need van Blee, you worry a little bit about loading up on [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1307.4799999999998s)]
*  a small primary guy throughout the course of the playoffs. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1313.0s)]
*  Um, you know, Brooks is so important to them, especially what he does defensively. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1316.6799999999998s)]
*  And then Jalen is kind of like an every other night guy. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1320.76s)]
*  And I thought you're giving him that. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1324.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1328.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1328.8799999999999s)]
*  I think he's a once a week guy. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1329.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1331.2s)]
*  That's right now. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1331.52s)]
*  Cause, cause as great as we are, like as much fun as a man is and what he could [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1332.52s)]
*  potentially be, I still have a hard time believing you're like running something [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1338.44s)]
*  for him with the ball in his hands to like get you the bucket weight. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1342.24s)]
*  I don't know that he's there yet. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1346.12s)]
*  They did it yesterday. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1347.6s)]
*  Four seconds left. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1349.76s)]
*  They ran the play firm and they were like, just beat Jalen, Jalen Brown off the [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1350.6799999999998s)]
*  dribble and just do some crazy athlete thing. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1354.6s)]
*  And even as he's like what you said earlier, it's almost like the baby [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1357.88s)]
*  deer on ice thing sometimes with him in offense where it's like, he's moving [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1361.52s)]
*  so fast, he can't even control it, but he still got the shot off. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1365.1200000000001s)]
*  G broke Jalen's ankles. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1368.48s)]
*  Um, it's the most fascinating development of the year for me as like, when we're [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1370.52s)]
*  talking about, uh, I'm not surprised when B ascended the way he did. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1375.88s)]
*  I'm not surprised SGA is having the year he is. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1380.1200000000001s)]
*  Neither of us are surprised by anything with the calves. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1383.56s)]
*  This is Thompson becoming like a top 20 trade asset. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1385.8799999999999s)]
*  I did not have that on my bingo card. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1389.24s)]
*  And I like the calves. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1391.72s)]
*  I didn't, I didn't think they were going to get off to like a 73 win [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1392.76s)]
*  pace, a third of it's starting to fade a little bit finally. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1395.8s)]
*  But when you're shooting, when you're shooting 50, 40, 90 for, or [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1399.32s)]
*  50, 40, 80 for three months, uh, I'm not going to go, I won't do all like the. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1402.6399999999999s)]
*  Honorable mentions, second apron casualties. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1408.8799999999999s)]
*  Can't believe they missed the top 80 toughest omissions, but I did send you [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1411.28s)]
*  the list and the toughest omissions for me. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1415.32s)]
*  I'll just rip through them quickly. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1418.32s)]
*  Reed shepherd, Jayden McDaniels, Anthony black, Klingon, Matheran, Dillingham, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1420.28s)]
*  beef stew, who I love at four years 60, but couldn't put them on. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1424.96s)]
*  Terry Eason, so on, uh, Thompson's brother, Peyton Pritchard, Mark Williams [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1430.0s)]
*  and them heart, is there anybody that jumped out on that last three? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1435.8s)]
*  Like, oh man, they should have made the trade value. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1438.3999999999999s)]
*  No, because I think any of these lists, like the first thing I did when I got it [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1440.48s)]
*  was like, don't go, I can't believe you did this because whenever you have to do [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1444.72s)]
*  these lists, like good luck, like whenever, even though when I did the top 100 that I [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1448.24s)]
*  then threw away, so I wasn't able to submit it for ringer.com, like I had such a hard [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1452.52s)]
*  time with 11 through 30. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1457.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1459.96s)]
*  Cause I'd go like, do I really think this guy is like a top 20 player? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1460.2s)]
*  And you go like, okay, we'll come up with a 20 names ahead of him. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1463.72s)]
*  And that's the weird part of the list. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1466.68s)]
*  Ahead of him. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1468.3600000000001s)]
*  And that's the weird part of the league ranking stuff. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1469.0800000000002s)]
*  And granted, this is different because of age and contract and all that kind of [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1471.28s)]
*  stuff, but I just, the, the names start to add up pretty quickly. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1473.64s)]
*  Um, I think maybe Matheran just because I've loved, I've loved what he's been [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1478.8400000000001s)]
*  able to do in big spots offensively. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1484.16s)]
*  And I like how competitive he is. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1486.76s)]
*  Oh dude. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1488.56s)]
*  He's a real, real Alfie. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1489.24s)]
*  Like there's no way he hasn't had conversations with buddies, like where one [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1491.1200000000001s)]
*  of his buddies like, yo, this should be your team, not Halliburts. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1494.6000000000001s)]
*  Like, I know just waiting, just waiting for it to become my team. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1497.08s)]
*  Um, right. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1501.1599999999999s)]
*  Like, would you rather have Kobe white or Matheran? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1501.6799999999998s)]
*  I mean, on your list, you'd rather have Kobe white. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1505.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1508.6s)]
*  Because I like his contract and he puts up numbers and stats and he plays hard, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1508.8799999999999s)]
*  but it's a good argument. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1513.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1514.96s)]
*  I'll, I'll bold Matheran. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1515.1599999999999s)]
*  Maybe, uh, maybe there's somebody. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1516.4399999999998s)]
*  You know, like I like Tari better than some of the names that you have in the top. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1519.04s)]
*  85, but. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1522.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, wait, hold that thought because I have to explain. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1525.1200000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1527.96s)]
*  This year is a top 85. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1528.1200000000001s)]
*  It's unusual. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1530.72s)]
*  Um, there were years in the mid two thousands when it was a top 40 and I was [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1531.8000000000002s)]
*  barely getting a 40, like barely like squeezing shoehorning names in to try to [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1538.0800000000002s)]
*  get to 40 this year, I really probably could have done a top hundred. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1543.76s)]
*  The league is so deep. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1547.5600000000002s)]
*  You don't really realize it until you're making a list like this. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1549.28s)]
*  So the top 85, the, the highest group is group O quality assets. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1551.68s)]
*  And just going from 85 to 75, Nicole, the Vusavich who on the right [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1557.2s)]
*  night could have 40 points. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1561.92s)]
*  Dejante Murray, cominga, Jalen Wells, Herb Jones, Jared McCain, Walker [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1563.76s)]
*  Kessler, Kobe white, Jabari Smith. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1568.76s)]
*  Deandre hunt Deandre Hunter has a good contract and cam Johnson, number 75. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1571.52s)]
*  So that's the first group. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1576.1200000000001s)]
*  And your question. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1578.3600000000001s)]
*  I, Easton was a tough one for me too. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1579.16s)]
*  Cause I really like him and I didn't know if I was overrating him or not. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1581.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1584.6000000000001s)]
*  I can see like, Hey, you know, what, what is he? [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1585.2s)]
*  And that's kind of the stuff we're talking about here with Thompson, where [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1590.0400000000002s)]
*  I tend to, I don't want to say overvalue cause I don't think I'm wrong about it, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1593.6000000000001s)]
*  but I'm going to value the guys with the ball in their hands. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1598.2s)]
*  It can get me multiple like possessions. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1601.1200000000001s)]
*  Like, Hey, Kade, like Kade Cunningham for me is somebody where you go, Hey, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1603.76s)]
*  fix this, fix us right now. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1607.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1609.4s)]
*  And clearly it's different with Detroit now that they've actually invested [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1609.64s)]
*  in spacing around him, but we'll get to Kade when we get to them. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1612.72s)]
*  But wait, that's always going to be kind of like my default setting of, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1616.92s)]
*  can you get me a bucket? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1621.24s)]
*  Or can you stop the other team from getting a bucket or really like, it's [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1623.24s)]
*  that simple because that's where I have some defense guys in this list that I'm [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1626.88s)]
*  like, I really value the defense. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1630.92s)]
*  But I don't think it's a 50 50 split. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1633.36s)]
*  I don't think it's 60 40. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1635.36s)]
*  Thanks for doing splits with me. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1638.0s)]
*  You know, I know I just, it might be 6139 the more I think. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1640.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1644.32s)]
*  See what's wrong with you? [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1644.8s)]
*  59, 41 giving us flat numbers like that. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1645.84s)]
*  So I was expecting like 63.5. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1650.24s)]
*  So in this quality assets list, though, the hardest one for me, whether it [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1653.24s)]
*  include him or not was DeJante Murray. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1658.36s)]
*  Um, who's got a fatter contract and whose teams never seem to do well. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1661.12s)]
*  And I don't know whether it's his fault or not, but at some point, if you're [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1666.32s)]
*  going to hit your thirties and this just keeps happening where every team you're [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1669.76s)]
*  on is either disappointing or underachieving, and you're one of the main [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1672.72s)]
*  guys, I have to look at you, but, uh, that's one. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1675.52s)]
*  And then Kaminka was the other one just cause he's a free agent next year. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1678.84s)]
*  And I think that complicates the asset piece. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1681.92s)]
*  Cause if you trade for him, you also have to pay him. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1683.8s)]
*  I put Jalen Wells in there because he's playing big minutes for this Memphis [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1687.16s)]
*  team and he's guarding the best guy in the other team every game. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1690.96s)]
*  And at some point that's. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1693.4s)]
*  That's got to matter. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1695.2s)]
*  Like they're winning with him. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1696.0800000000002s)]
*  He always has the toughest defensive assignment. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1697.52s)]
*  And I think for, for a team relying on two rookies like that with Edie too, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1700.52s)]
*  like it's been, it's really unusual to see a team that's good relying on guys [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1704.64s)]
*  who's their first year in the league and in like significant roles, like, Hey, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1709.68s)]
*  Edie come in and we're going to run offense through you and protect the rim. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1713.6000000000001s)]
*  Like it's unusual. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1716.3600000000001s)]
*  Anyway, I really, I really like well, so I want to put them on there. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1717.72s)]
*  All right. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1720.2s)]
*  Next group. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1720.4s)]
*  This group is called before the second apron shit. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1721.68s)]
*  I absolutely would have hung up, but what are you thinking? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1724.3600000000001s)]
*  So this is a six guys, number 74, poor Zingas, Aaron Gordon, Damien [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1727.8400000000001s)]
*  Lillard, Zach Levine, Drew holiday and Pascal Siakam, all of them big contracts [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1733.56s)]
*  that you would have felt better about two, three years ago, did is Dame too [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1740.52s)]
*  high, too low, or just right for you. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1746.56s)]
*  This feels low. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1748.16s)]
*  Even if he hasn't been my favorite throughout all this. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1749.64s)]
*  And I do wonder too, like when we were talking about the heat at the very top, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1752.68s)]
*  like what if Dame had gone there and it was the same situation with Butler? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1755.96s)]
*  Cause if Butler's not getting the contract, would Dame be going, I just wonder [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1760.0800000000002s)]
*  if Dame at any point is going, this actually worked out better for me, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1763.72s)]
*  despite the fact that Milwaukee probably more based on health than anything has [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1766.28s)]
*  been disappointing when you bring in somebody like Dame to pair with Janis [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1771.92s)]
*  with this. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1775.6399999999999s)]
*  Uh, the Gordon one is tough man because Gordon with Denver is worth so much more [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1776.08s)]
*  to them than as soon as Gordon is away from Yoke Hitch, he's just not going [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1782.6s)]
*  to be the same kind of player. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1787.56s)]
*  So his contract, this is year one, he had an extension. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1790.12s)]
*  So it's basically five years and one 50. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1793.56s)]
*  So it's pricey. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1796.36s)]
*  It's not crazy. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1797.1999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1799.8s)]
*  And he plays really well with Yoke Hitch. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1800.0s)]
*  So I think that makes his value higher just because, you know, it's, it's just [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1802.0s)]
*  too Yoke Hitch is that such a crucial point in his career and he's such an [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1807.24s)]
*  important player, not just for this generation, but just historically, like [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1811.56s)]
*  I just know Aaron Gordon's good with him. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1815.8s)]
*  So I'm not trading them, you know, it would really have to take something [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1817.56s)]
*  for me to give up, give them up. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1821.16s)]
*  So when you label this second apron thing, which I think you're absolutely [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1822.8799999999999s)]
*  right about like Przingus and, and the other guys, you know, the, the, the [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1826.4s)]
*  like Przingus and Drew, and you wonder like after this version of the Celtics, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1830.72s)]
*  if there's a second apron transaction that happens there with Boston, depending [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1834.48s)]
*  how the season goes. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1838.52s)]
*  You mean in July? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1839.0s)]
*  You mean emphatically yes. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1841.08s)]
*  You mean next month? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1842.96s)]
*  Don't you think Gordon's a no because of basketball first and contract [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1844.88s)]
*  second, if at all? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1848.76s)]
*  For good? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1850.88s)]
*  I don't, I just think he plays too well with Yoke Hitch. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1851.1200000000001s)]
*  And as long as, as long as you have Yoke Hitch, you have a chance to win the [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1853.52s)]
*  title, that contract's not prohibitive. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1856.4s)]
*  The Murray contract's probably a little more problematic. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1858.92s)]
*  You know, if, although he's been really good the last couple of weeks, and I [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1862.2s)]
*  think we're all a little happier with what we're seeing, but I would be more [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1865.5600000000002s)]
*  worried about that because you can't miss on the $50 million contract. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1868.68s)]
*  You can overpay a little bit on the guys making 30. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1871.52s)]
*  Levine should be behind him is my point. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1874.5600000000002s)]
*  Levine should be behind Gordon. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1877.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1878.96s)]
*  Do you like Levine? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1880.76s)]
*  I do. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1882.5600000000002s)]
*  I, I, I'm stunned. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1883.68s)]
*  It's another shocking thing that's happened this season. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1885.0s)]
*  Because I've watched him multiple times be the best guy in the court in [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1888.52s)]
*  games against really good teams. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1893.8s)]
*  And it wasn't like once we're talking seven, eight, nine times where it's just, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1896.08s)]
*  he's really hard to defend and he's playing, I think as well offensively as [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1900.96s)]
*  he's ever played, and I, I just, I value the offense. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1905.12s)]
*  He's a 25 points a game guy that can go toe to toe with whoever at the end of a [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1908.6399999999999s)]
*  game, you know, it's not nothing. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1912.12s)]
*  Like I would rather have him than Dame at this point. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1914.52s)]
*  Cause I can find, I can find point guards. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1918.2s)]
*  I think it's much harder to find these swings that can create a shot. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1921.28s)]
*  Like if Golden state somehow got Zach Levine and I don't think it would take a [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1924.52s)]
*  ton, he would be so huge for them because they have no other guy who can create a [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1927.6s)]
*  shot other than Steph. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1933.28s)]
*  And how many times can you run Steph in a semi circle and set him picks and [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1934.8799999999999s)]
*  do little hand like they have nothing else. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1939.8s)]
*  They've nobody else unless till cominga comes back. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1941.72s)]
*  So you're not wrong about that. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1944.12s)]
*  You're not wrong about that. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1947.0s)]
*  I mean, the drop off from primary score to secondary, like shot creation [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1947.96s)]
*  guy for Golden state is so significant. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1952.3600000000001s)]
*  And that's why, you know, granted, yes, I love Steph, but when he has like bad [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1955.0s)]
*  games, there'll be this group. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1959.64s)]
*  It's usually like LeBron weirdos. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1961.76s)]
*  And like, Oh, how come Steph never, like, I don't really love that content of like [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1964.1200000000001s)]
*  somebody who's just done it the right way has won multiple rings, first ballot, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1967.4s)]
*  everything it's like, can you guys shit on him for a couple of weeks? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1971.88s)]
*  You're like, you know what? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1974.92s)]
*  I don't want to. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1975.48s)]
*  And I'm not going to like he missed some shots, but what he has tasked with to [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1976.52s)]
*  solve their problems offensively as the only guy, you know, other than the [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1981.3600000000001s)]
*  Schroeder acquisition. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1986.4s)]
*  And I know like you could, which is not where my face, right? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1987.44s)]
*  You could throw it right back in my face and be like, I thought you just started [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1990.8400000000001s)]
*  this podcast talking about you like bucket getters and you're absolutely right. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1992.88s)]
*  Like there's moments with Levine where he looks like the most offensively [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1996.24s)]
*  talented player on the court. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=1999.1200000000001s)]
*  But there are just too many plays as a seasoned Levine watcher. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2001.64s)]
*  There are too many plays in there that I think everybody misses where you're [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2005.24s)]
*  like, what were you doing here? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2009.32s)]
*  Who are you helping do this? [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2010.64s)]
*  What, why didn't you get back on defense here? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2012.16s)]
*  And they're constant and they're all these. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2014.48s)]
*  He's flawed. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2017.08s)]
*  I will fully admit he's flawed. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2017.56s)]
*  There's a lot with him. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2018.8s)]
*  It's the 71 trade asset. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2019.8799999999999s)]
*  It seems fair. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2021.36s)]
*  I could just do it. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2022.48s)]
*  I know. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2023.24s)]
*  Like I thought about doing a version of like something on my podcast where it [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2023.8s)]
*  was going to be one name, one game, where I just watch one player the entire time. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2027.64s)]
*  Like that Julius Randall heat game where I just go, you know, I'm going to re [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2033.52s)]
*  watch this and just watch Randall. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2036.32s)]
*  And it was when you really focus in the guy that you're like, how come this guy [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2038.48s)]
*  always has numbers and how come his teams are never that good and how come like [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2043.04s)]
*  he's so skilled, like what else is happening around this? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2046.56s)]
*  And you go, well, that's not good. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2049.32s)]
*  And that's not good. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2051.04s)]
*  And that's, and I talk about this stuff all the time with certain players. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2051.92s)]
*  And I think Levine's the epitome of that. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2054.4s)]
*  Jalen's had a couple of tough ones. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2057.04s)]
*  Jalen Brown has had a couple of tough ones this year in that respect. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2058.6s)]
*  Like if you just watch him where he not helping on the maxi inbounds, he'll end [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2061.7599999999998s)]
*  up with the stats, but if you watch the game, he does, he'll have games where he [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2066.8399999999997s)]
*  just does 20 things you don't like. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2072.0s)]
*  And you could, you could make a YouTube clip. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2074.7999999999997s)]
*  I just think he's had a really rough season compared to what happened last [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2077.2s)]
*  year, where he really, I think one, a lot of us over as this guy has taken a step [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2080.2799999999997s)]
*  up and I feel like this year he's gone back to where he was two years ago. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2084.68s)]
*  And there's just really, especially watching them in person two nights in a row. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2088.9599999999996s)]
*  It just, just is, he's got been really messy this year and I'm waiting for it to [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2092.4399999999996s)]
*  not be the case anymore. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2099.0s)]
*  And I'm just not seeing it. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2100.12s)]
*  But at least we know at like the highest level he is, he's delivered. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2100.68s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2104.52s)]
*  So you're hoping in April, it doesn't become messy anymore and it's back, but I'm [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2105.2s)]
*  just saying the regular season's been messy. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2109.72s)]
*  But there are some scores when I think about their playoff resume and be like, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2112.04s)]
*  so you've been doing this for how many years and there's nothing significant. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2115.44s)]
*  There's not a moment for me to look at and like, look, I'm with you. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2119.28s)]
*  There's, there's stuff with Jalen Brown and this year the shooting and, but, you [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2122.56s)]
*  know, when, when you're that young, like we've argued about Murray, when players [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2127.96s)]
*  who are like, have had something really good in their past have these, like I [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2133.64s)]
*  even was stubborn about Kelvin Johnson. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2138.08s)]
*  I'm like, is he just going to be terrible now? [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2140.4s)]
*  He's going to be terrible. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2142.64s)]
*  And I feel like he turned the corner a little bit this season. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2144.12s)]
*  Um, so even though the Jalen stuff, I would agree with you has been frustrating. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2147.0s)]
*  At least we've seen that before. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2149.84s)]
*  Well, what are you throwing at me with Levine? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2150.84s)]
*  And be like, remember, remember this series? [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2154.6s)]
*  He, well, he doesn't have it, but I do think if you're going to complain about [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2158.08s)]
*  the rules, not you, but just in general, the second apron, how hard it is to do [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2163.4s)]
*  trades, like the one good thing that's happened with all of this is it's forced [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2166.6400000000003s)]
*  guys like Levine to be like, I guess I'm stuck here. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2169.88s)]
*  I'm just going to have to play well. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2171.88s)]
*  And he's had for what, for what he is, I think he's achieved whatever, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2173.8s)]
*  whatever his talent ceiling is. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2179.24s)]
*  I think he's achieved that. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2180.72s)]
*  I also think now that Lonzo's kind of back, like Lonzo's getting [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2181.6s)]
*  thrown in these trade rumors. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2185.0s)]
*  He's an expiring contract, 20 million. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2186.88s)]
*  If you watch the bulls, I'm not positive I would even trade Lonzo. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2188.48s)]
*  I kind of like the bulls. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2193.36s)]
*  I'm not even sure they should do anything. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2194.64s)]
*  Wait, I don't know. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2196.96s)]
*  I don't feel like any of their, any, they're not going to actually get [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2199.72s)]
*  anything for any of their players. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2203.0s)]
*  So it's like, well, why am I doing anything? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2204.3599999999997s)]
*  I'll just make the plan and try to upset somebody. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2205.92s)]
*  I don't, it doesn't seem like any of their players are properly valued. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2209.2799999999997s)]
*  It's like, I wouldn't just give away Vusovic. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2212.64s)]
*  Oh, thanks. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2214.48s)]
*  You're going to be two twos for Boosevich. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2215.0s)]
*  I'm not doing that. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2216.96s)]
*  I'm not like giving away Levine and taking back a bad contract. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2218.6s)]
*  I'll trade Levine. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2221.68s)]
*  I'll get Bradley bill back. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2222.3999999999996s)]
*  Why would I do that? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2223.3999999999996s)]
*  Like, why would I give away? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2225.48s)]
*  I like watching Lonzo. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2226.7599999999998s)]
*  They owe their pick this year though. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2228.32s)]
*  So they have to get into the lottery. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2230.1600000000003s)]
*  Then go higher and just lose your pick outside the lottery. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2232.84s)]
*  Next category, possible studs on rookie deals going from number 68 to 62. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2237.8s)]
*  Kulabale, Saar, Messi. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2244.6800000000003s)]
*  Did you expect this from him? [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2247.4s)]
*  Yves, I didn't expect this. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2249.8s)]
*  I mean, he looks incredible and he's so confident too. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2252.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2257.56s)]
*  There's no hesitation on him, his aggressiveness. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2257.7999999999997s)]
*  I feel bad for the Pelicans front office. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2260.68s)]
*  Cause when you think about... [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2264.3599999999997s)]
*  They're 12 and 35. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2264.7999999999997s)]
*  Like, and I like nine of their players. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2267.04s)]
*  They have done such a good job through the draft and they have just, you know, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2270.3199999999997s)]
*  their main guys aren't healthy. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2276.08s)]
*  So it's not a mystery. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2277.48s)]
*  I have him at 66, Ware at 65, a stunning turn of events for him. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2279.68s)]
*  And I was guilty of saying it too. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2284.8799999999997s)]
*  It's like, Oh man, imagine if Miami had taken Connect or Jared McCain. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2286.6s)]
*  And then Ware the last few weeks has looked like the kind of young big at a cheap [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2291.7599999999998s)]
*  price that anyone would want. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2297.04s)]
*  Risa Shea, I'm never selling my stock on him. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2299.16s)]
*  Kason Wallace at 63 and then Derek Lively at 62. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2303.48s)]
*  Those are our possible studs on rookie deals. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2307.12s)]
*  And for trade value purposes, having those guys, if those guys can play a [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2310.68s)]
*  rotation role and you're paying 4 million, 3 million, 6 million, that's where [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2313.8s)]
*  you want to be next group. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2318.44s)]
*  Nope. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2321.6000000000004s)]
*  He's worth way more to us than you. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2322.2000000000003s)]
*  Number 61, Devin Vassell. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2324.88s)]
*  Now this trade value starts to get fun right around here. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2327.44s)]
*  Number 60, Zubots wasn't prepared for him to be that high in the list, but I [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2330.2000000000003s)]
*  don't know how many Quipper games I have to watch where he's the best center in [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2335.28s)]
*  the game. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2339.32s)]
*  His contract is three for 58. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2339.76s)]
*  Too high, too low or right range for him? [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2342.2400000000002s)]
*  I love Zoo. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2344.6800000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2345.88s)]
*  I think he fights his ass off all the time. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2346.76s)]
*  There's some good rim protection stuff in there as well. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2349.88s)]
*  His hands. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2352.6800000000003s)]
*  I think it's a big part of why they win. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2353.36s)]
*  I don't know if anybody will do this because I'm not going to do it, but I'd love to [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2355.1200000000003s)]
*  know the success rate of pocket passes. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2358.1200000000003s)]
*  Cause I think a few guys like did it a couple of years ago and then everybody [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2360.44s)]
*  decided that when the big rolled and the two stayed with them, they were like, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2364.4s)]
*  I'm going to do this sick look away bounce pass and then it's going to hit [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2368.32s)]
*  somebody's feet or it's never going to work. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2372.6000000000004s)]
*  I think the success rate on this, this pocket pass that every player is obsessed [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2374.36s)]
*  with off of two staying with them is so low. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2378.1600000000003s)]
*  Uh, but a lot of times too, they're screwing the big by trying to even throw [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2381.48s)]
*  it to these guys and Zoo for like the bigs that are out there. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2384.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm like, you sure? [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2386.96s)]
*  Like, I know what the play calls for and that you think this is the right move, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2387.6800000000003s)]
*  but can the guy actually catch it? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2391.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm a big Zoo fan, man. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2393.1200000000003s)]
*  So I thought this was fine. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2394.84s)]
*  Instead of a pocket pass, I would call it the tibia pass. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2396.52s)]
*  You know, it always ends up somewhere between the guy's feet and his knee [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2401.08s)]
*  and the guy's seven feet tall. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2404.88s)]
*  It's like, I'm pretty sure he's not going to be able to take that pass. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2406.28s)]
*  Jaylen Brown, unfortunately throws a lot of these. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2409.36s)]
*  Like, Hey, do you see limbs in the way of the pass? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2411.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2414.52s)]
*  Well then don't, don't make it. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2414.7599999999998s)]
*  It's like, nah, dude, two stayed with me. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2416.64s)]
*  Have to throw the pocket pass every time. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2418.72s)]
*  Uh, Zoo number 60, James Harden, number 59. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2421.2s)]
*  The deliverer of what a comeback. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2424.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2426.52s)]
*  So two Clippers in the top 60. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2427.88s)]
*  Next three, I'm going to put in a row number 58, Scotty Barnes, number [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2430.88s)]
*  57, Trey Young, number 56, Jamal Murray, big contracts, contracts you had to do. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2434.16s)]
*  I don't think the team feels awesome about the contracts, but you kind of, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2443.6s)]
*  it's like those no recourse contracts. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2447.6s)]
*  How would you rank those three? [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2449.84s)]
*  I have them Murray had a young and Barnes. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2451.44s)]
*  Is that the right, is that the right order for you? [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2454.4s)]
*  It feels like if Palo's eight, Scotty Barnes shouldn't be 59 or 58. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2457.44s)]
*  All right. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2463.7999999999997s)]
*  So I'm one of the many reasons I'm glad you're here. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2464.24s)]
*  I don't see the Scotty Barnes thing like some others, and I might be too [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2469.0s)]
*  down on him, but I'm glad you're here. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2474.16s)]
*  Like some others, and I might be too down on him, but I do think when you're [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2476.7599999999998s)]
*  the best guy in the team and the team doesn't win at some point, some of that's [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2481.3999999999996s)]
*  got to be on you because I like, I think this, the Toronto team is actually pretty [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2485.52s)]
*  interesting if you, if you watch them, they have guys all over the place, even [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2489.56s)]
*  like a bad, a bad G it's like a 45% three point shooter is like their ninth man. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2493.72s)]
*  Like they have skilled players. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2499.4399999999996s)]
*  I don't understand why they're not better. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2501.16s)]
*  Um, so anyway, you could talk me into him being 38 or you could have talked me into [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2503.6s)]
*  being here and I, I aired on, I haven't really seen him be an impact guy on a [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2508.44s)]
*  winning team, Trey young, at least has been an impact guy on a winning team. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2513.12s)]
*  Jamal Murray won a title, Tyler hero who's number 55. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2517.08s)]
*  And I think he's been a more efficient, better offensive [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2521.84s)]
*  player than all those other guys. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2524.7599999999998s)]
*  I just would rather have Tyler here at three for 93 than pay the max for Scotty [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2527.08s)]
*  Barnes. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2530.88s)]
*  Well, look, this is probably the wrong time to be ranking Scotty Barnes. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2533.24s)]
*  Cause it's getting worse. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2537.0s)]
*  The efficiency stuff, like continues to decline over a four year stretch. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2538.7599999999998s)]
*  He's back under 30% from three. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2543.04s)]
*  I think you always knew that he was a weird player, but in a good way, because [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2545.96s)]
*  he could do so many different things. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2550.32s)]
*  But yeah, you know, back to like the primary scoring thing, like I don't [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2552.52s)]
*  think he was ever going to be like a Cade. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2556.16s)]
*  And even though Paulo, like people would get on him with his efficiency, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2558.64s)]
*  stuff, especially last year, like that was the big Palo Scotty Barnes argument [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2561.92s)]
*  last year. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2565.1200000000003s)]
*  It's like, yeah, but are you watching the shots that Palo is tasked with [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2565.6400000000003s)]
*  taking? [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2568.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2569.92s)]
*  All these other guys are out. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2570.2000000000003s)]
*  Please factor that in. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2571.2400000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2572.1600000000003s)]
*  Like watch and see how difficult some of the shots are for this dude, because [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2572.4s)]
*  he's, he's left with the ball to bail them out of every one of these possessions. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2577.2000000000003s)]
*  So I think if you did like a four year thing of Scotty and then, you know, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2580.0800000000004s)]
*  again, it's your list. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2585.28s)]
*  So I don't want to sit here and go through 10 straight guys. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2586.0800000000004s)]
*  I'm happy to, too low, too low, too low. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2588.5600000000004s)]
*  No, this is one of the ones I really wanted to hash out. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2590.08s)]
*  Like he's averaging 28 and six, 28 and six this season. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2594.48s)]
*  He should 27% from three. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2598.88s)]
*  And I guess my fear for him, and this would actually be a good outcome for his [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2601.16s)]
*  career, but there was that Iguodala stretch in Philly when he was miscast as [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2605.96s)]
*  the lead guy who's like, I'm going to be the guy who cares our offense at the end [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2611.96s)]
*  of games and I'm our number one guy. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2615.96s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2618.44s)]
*  The team never won. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2619.08s)]
*  And then once that got repositioned as like, no, I'm actually an awesome, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2620.52s)]
*  overqualified number three guy or number four guy, and I'm going to guard the best [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2624.44s)]
*  guy in the other team and I'm going to learn how to hit three points. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2629.2000000000003s)]
*  And I'm just like completely additive. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2632.28s)]
*  And then he found his destiny. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2634.28s)]
*  I wonder if that's Scotty Barnes. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2636.0s)]
*  I wonder if he's just miscast right now is we're going to run our [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2637.92s)]
*  offense through Scotty Barnes. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2640.4s)]
*  I don't think you're going to win games if you run in the offense for him. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2641.56s)]
*  At least the player is now. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2644.48s)]
*  Uh, yeah, but the thing is, I think his playmaking is actually pretty good, but [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2646.3199999999997s)]
*  it's, it's just, we talked about Toronto this summer. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2650.16s)]
*  It's like, look at who they're paying. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2653.08s)]
*  Look how much they're paying all these guys. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2654.36s)]
*  And there's nights where I like RJ Barrett, but it feels like everybody's a slot up [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2655.7599999999998s)]
*  too high on a priority list for a basketball team. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2659.7599999999998s)]
*  And it's like a movie where they couldn't find the guy to put on the poster and [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2663.4s)]
*  it's a bunch of character actors and role players. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2667.12s)]
*  And it's like, ah, I don't know. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2670.44s)]
*  Kind of wish we had Nick Cage in this one. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2673.2s)]
*  If you were Lawrence Frank in Toronto called and offered Scotty [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2676.0s)]
*  Barnes or norm Powell, you're not saying no. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2678.68s)]
*  As a straight up deal though, like Scotty's making. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2683.4s)]
*  Well, I don't mid forties, but that's part of the trade by thing. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2687.08s)]
*  Norm's making 17 million a year averaging 24 points a game. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2690.44s)]
*  So you have to factor in the seller. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2694.48s)]
*  Do I want to pay Scotty Barnes 45 or norm Powell 17, whatever the numbers are. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2696.08s)]
*  That's what that's where this gets hard. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2701.72s)]
*  Cause if I'm paying Scotty, the number I'm paying him, I only have money to pay [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2704.2s)]
*  two, two and a half guys that much money. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2707.4399999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2710.08s)]
*  So now I'm all in, he's gotta be one of my best two guys on the [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2710.4799999999996s)]
*  team trying to win the title. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2713.3199999999997s)]
*  And I don't know if he's that guy yet. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2714.8399999999997s)]
*  Do you think Miami would say no to Scotty Barnes for Tyler hero? [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2717.0s)]
*  I do. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2723.4799999999996s)]
*  Really? [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2725.12s)]
*  When you factor in the salaries. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2725.4799999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2726.8399999999997s)]
*  If I'd rather pay Tyler here with 30 million. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2727.4399999999996s)]
*  But you might be right. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2729.6800000000003s)]
*  That's why we're doing this. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2730.8s)]
*  My fear is that because the numbers are down the way that they are. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2731.96s)]
*  And you know what, you know, even, even if we didn't like Toronto, which we both [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2736.8s)]
*  didn't like Toronto this summer and the record bears that, but you're right. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2740.76s)]
*  Like there are some nights with them or I'll go, Oh, like RJ's having a big night. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2743.8s)]
*  And you're like, Oh, this is why they wanted to purdle back, you know, but [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2748.32s)]
*  they've, they've also had a really disjointed, like they haven't had much [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2750.96s)]
*  consistency for like, you know, like the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2754.28s)]
*  long stretches this season of having a bunch of guys be available too. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2759.32s)]
*  Would you, do you think the Celtics would trade Derek White for Scotty [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2763.84s)]
*  Burns? [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2767.48s)]
*  If age were there. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2769.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2769.96s)]
*  Cause age would just go give me the potential talent ceiling. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2770.4s)]
*  Um, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2775.0s)]
*  but you're taking on like 15 million extra a year. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2776.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2778.92s)]
*  Well then now we're talking second. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2779.04s)]
*  Now you're second. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2780.2000000000003s)]
*  So that's, that's second aprons a part of this though. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2780.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2784.84s)]
*  That's a different trade. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2785.56s)]
*  See, I don't think there's any way. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2787.04s)]
*  Here's whenever we're doing this exercise, right? [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2789.12s)]
*  Yep. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2791.36s)]
*  If right now is like the only time in the last couple of years that we would [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2792.84s)]
*  say Miami would turn down Scotty Barnes for Tyler hero is that when we're making [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2796.8s)]
*  the mistake, I'm going to move him down and I'm going to put them in a new spot. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2801.4s)]
*  And yet I actually have a better category. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2807.8s)]
*  You talk me into it. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2809.6s)]
*  I'll move them up 10 spots and I might be wrong. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2810.32s)]
*  I will fully admit. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2812.32s)]
*  I might be two glass half empty. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2814.56s)]
*  There's a couple of guys, I'm a little too glass half empty on. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2816.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2819.56s)]
*  You want to run the numbers on it. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2820.16s)]
*  It just, I was like, man, and maybe it's because I've been so used to the [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2823.2s)]
*  Palo Scotty argument and like they're 50 slots apart on this one. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2826.8s)]
*  And it's not like I want Scotty over Palo, but I was like, damn. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2832.36s)]
*  50. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2836.76s)]
*  Well, Palo is another one that I, I, I wasn't sure the right rank for him. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2837.08s)]
*  All right. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2840.36s)]
*  So we'll go 59 hard and 58 tray young 56 Jamal or 57 Jamal Murray, 56 hero. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2840.6s)]
*  And then 55 Isaiah heart and Stein who is just a winning player on a good [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2847.68s)]
*  contract and I value what he does when he's out there, his team plays better. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2853.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2857.8399999999997s)]
*  And I just feel like they wouldn't trade him. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2858.2s)]
*  I think he has an incredible amount of value for them. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2861.7599999999998s)]
*  And, uh, and that's that is tray too low. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2864.56s)]
*  Which way would you put them higher into the forties or would you put them backwards? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2871.7599999999998s)]
*  Cause he's got a lot of intrinsic value to the Hawks and to the [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2878.2s)]
*  franchise as like their guy. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2881.7599999999998s)]
*  And they built a pretty nice set of assets around him that [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2885.04s)]
*  compliment what he does. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2889.04s)]
*  You know, but I also, I'm not sure what his trade value would be around the week. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2891.12s)]
*  Well, it wasn't very good this summer. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2895.16s)]
*  And there was, there was a big piece on the athletic that spoke directly to that. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2896.68s)]
*  And I know that like, it's two guys that have caught the brunt of shit from Atlanta. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2900.96s)]
*  I wouldn't even just say it's fans is like media members. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2907.64s)]
*  It was like, Trey was their guy. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2910.24s)]
*  And then you're like, okay, did you see this piece where they basically said we [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2911.52s)]
*  need to be completely different with you? [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2914.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2916.08s)]
*  That's your matter. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2917.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2918.64s)]
*  And so you've seen it. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2919.08s)]
*  You've seen it this year. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2921.4s)]
*  Um, you know, whether it's Deandre being better in his role and Jaylen taking on, [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2922.96s)]
*  um, such a huge part of the offense, like, I think it was a little alarming that it [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2927.8399999999997s)]
*  took this many years for them to say, Hey, Trey, you know, what'd be really cool is [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2931.68s)]
*  when you have the ball, throw it up ahead to see if there's an opportunity to attack. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2934.76s)]
*  Like kind of like that halfway transition. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2939.96s)]
*  You got four of them. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2942.8s)]
*  You can use them at any time. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2943.76s)]
*  It's not just in the half court. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2945.1600000000003s)]
*  That line, you can give them the ball before you cross that line. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2947.0s)]
*  No shit. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2951.1600000000003s)]
*  So look, all that stuff was in there and they were like, they need to [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2952.6000000000004s)]
*  reevaluate what this is. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2956.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's not like he's taken 12 shots a game as opposed to 20. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2957.44s)]
*  He's only down like a couple of shots there. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2960.44s)]
*  The assist numbers are huge. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2961.84s)]
*  There was an also another piece, like, I'm sorry that I'm just reading it. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2962.88s)]
*  And I was sort of just laughing as I read all these quotes. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2965.92s)]
*  It was like, you know, I don't need to just hang onto the basketball and [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2968.32s)]
*  wait for the assist play. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2971.2400000000002s)]
*  I can pass it to someone else who then can move the ball around a little bit. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2973.28s)]
*  Oh, that was the you think so doctor Boogadets quote. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2977.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2982.04s)]
*  So, um, I, you know, we both sneaky liked this roster for a while. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2982.48s)]
*  And I like it even more. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2988.48s)]
*  I guess I'll never understand the Kong Wu thing of like, why every time I would [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2990.0s)]
*  watch it, like, so Clint's still the better option there. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2993.32s)]
*  And then they made that change. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2996.32s)]
*  And every three weeks at Congo looks like Bill Russell in like 1963. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=2998.36s)]
*  It's gotta mean something. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3003.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3005.76s)]
*  And I guess I wanted to put him in this list and I didn't, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3006.2400000000002s)]
*  couldn't find a spot for him, but you're kind of doing the hawks top 85. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3009.64s)]
*  Um, Hey, next group. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3013.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3016.56s)]
*  This is a one person group. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3017.2400000000002s)]
*  It's called, sorry, I can't answer your call. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3019.44s)]
*  I'm taking a long sad walk. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3021.36s)]
*  Please leave message after the beep. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3023.12s)]
*  And that is number 54, Joel Embiid. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3026.0s)]
*  I have no idea what Joel Embiid's trade vet. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3028.6s)]
*  You could tell me that Philly has to attach picks to trade him. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3030.44s)]
*  You could tell me people would offer picks for him. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3033.2400000000002s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3035.36s)]
*  I, you could tell me anything. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3036.6s)]
*  I would believe it. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3038.44s)]
*  And you don't know either. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3040.28s)]
*  I don't, but I, I wasn't mad about it. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3042.48s)]
*  I didn't go, this is outrageous. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3044.92s)]
*  He doesn't play. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3047.32s)]
*  I remember. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3047.8s)]
*  No. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3048.96s)]
*  And I remember like last year when it was, I think it was, we already talked [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3049.28s)]
*  about it when we did the Denver show and I mentioned the Zach Lowe part of it. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3053.52s)]
*  I wasn't being critical of Zach, but it was just this accepted thing because of [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3055.88s)]
*  who Embiid had been, he'd won the MVP that it was like he was in the top five. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3059.1200000000003s)]
*  And I don't think you just automatically lose your spot when you're not healthy. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3062.8s)]
*  And maybe even if you miss a year, but with him, I don't know, I don't [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3065.76s)]
*  know what you do with him. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3070.4s)]
*  I'd love to know what the contract negotiation was, like why they were [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3071.32s)]
*  in such a hurry to extend him. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3074.48s)]
*  And it certainly took him what? [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3075.96s)]
*  12 seconds to go done. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3077.2400000000002s)]
*  12. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3079.4s)]
*  I think it was four. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3080.0s)]
*  Uh, I would, if I want to sound a little, can I docu-sign that right now? [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3082.4s)]
*  Can you just send that to me right now? [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3086.44s)]
*  I got a docu-sign. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3087.6s)]
*  I have it open. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3088.52s)]
*  Don't send a docu-sign. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3089.12s)]
*  I'll drive to you. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3090.2000000000003s)]
*  I have my own Sharpie. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3092.8s)]
*  I, uh, I don't know what his value is, man. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3095.16s)]
*  I just don't know that I'd want to be in business because why is it supposed to [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3098.92s)]
*  get better? [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3102.4s)]
*  And for all the shit that he's taken right now for missing games and the [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3102.88s)]
*  Denver history he's brought back up, I'd ask the people that are mad at him for [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3105.4s)]
*  not, did you watch when he was playing? [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3108.96s)]
*  And like, you can come at me with the box score and all that stuff. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3111.2000000000003s)]
*  The guy doesn't move. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3114.2400000000002s)]
*  Just go watch the, go watch the Golden State game. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3115.7200000000003s)]
*  If you're wondering why. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3118.32s)]
*  And he got his numbers. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3119.2400000000002s)]
*  And he got his numbers. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3120.52s)]
*  So you'll say, Oh no, what are you guys talking about? [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3121.36s)]
*  And it's like, man, there's more. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3123.36s)]
*  Just watch him on defense. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3124.6800000000003s)]
*  So, if he's going to move that badly, my point is I don't even blame him for [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3127.44s)]
*  not playing like he was clearly marginalized when he was out there and now [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3131.64s)]
*  people are mad that he's not playing anymore. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3136.0s)]
*  And I kind of look at that stretch of going, well, if that's how bad it was [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3137.64s)]
*  going to look, then he actually needs to as frustrating as it for everybody. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3141.08s)]
*  He needs to be missing games to not look like that anymore. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3144.12s)]
*  Cause that's not going to work either. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3146.7599999999998s)]
*  It was handled horrendously by the team. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3149.16s)]
*  It was handled horrendously by Embiid and it's gotten worse the whole season. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3151.3599999999997s)]
*  And I know, I know a bunch of Sixer fans, all of them are in that zone of just [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3155.7999999999997s)]
*  like, why aren't you just telling us what's going on? [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3160.44s)]
*  Why the secrecy? [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3163.28s)]
*  Why are you hiding things? [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3164.2000000000003s)]
*  Why is this so murky at all times? [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3165.36s)]
*  It's, you know, it just sucks the life out of the franchise, the fans, but then [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3169.04s)]
*  say, you don't know, cause they tried to say in the beginning of the season, they [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3173.4s)]
*  tried to make it seem like, Oh, he's doing some, some, uh, some knee management stuff. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3176.12s)]
*  And he clearly is not going to be able to play three games in a row. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3181.08s)]
*  And if he does, you know, the other thing when he plays well and they're like [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3185.52s)]
*  strategically picking these games or it's like, Hey, Charlotte tonight. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3189.56s)]
*  You want to play? [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3192.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3193.16s)]
*  Charlotte. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3193.6s)]
*  Great. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3194.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3194.48s)]
*  Let me, let me give that a whirl. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3194.88s)]
*  Um, but I don't think, does anybody think he's going to be able to play [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3196.48s)]
*  four straight playoff rounds? [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3199.96s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3202.96s)]
*  Do you think he played three? [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3203.68s)]
*  Do you think he played two? [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3204.92s)]
*  What's going to be better about this two months from now? [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3206.52s)]
*  I don't even know how you would project to be like, yeah, that no, it'll, it'll, [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3209.72s)]
*  it'll just be fine. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3212.64s)]
*  Um, the Olympics was clearly a huge priority to him. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3213.72s)]
*  And I think part of it was, you're not going to win a title, like, you know, [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3216.68s)]
*  win a gold and, you know, he's had some big moments for him, but for somebody [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3221.16s)]
*  who just doesn't ever seem to be right. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3227.56s)]
*  Like, was that, was that the best use of your time? [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3230.68s)]
*  Also, we've been basketball fans for a long time. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3234.3199999999997s)]
*  We've seen some things in the direction this has gone. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3236.72s)]
*  We just have a mental history of other guys where we've watched this kind of [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3240.2s)]
*  arc or lack of an arc. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3245.32s)]
*  And it's like C web. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3247.76s)]
*  No, once the microfracture surgery goes through, it's, it'll be fine. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3249.36s)]
*  He should be, you know, the only one I can remember where the guy was gone and [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3252.88s)]
*  it seemed bleak and then he came back and was really good with Zemara Stoudemire. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3256.92s)]
*  Um, especially in the 2010 season and that first stretch and with the Knicks in [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3261.2000000000003s)]
*  2011, where it seemed like he had hit that point where you just could never rely on [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3265.52s)]
*  him again. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3269.2000000000003s)]
*  And then he did rally back and beads carrying. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3270.1600000000003s)]
*  I don't know, 50, 60, 70 extra pounds and more inches and everything. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3274.2799999999997s)]
*  And I just think Yao Ming was another one. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3279.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3282.16s)]
*  His feet aren't good. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3282.4s)]
*  And then all of a sudden he was just out of basketball. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3283.2s)]
*  I think with it, with these tall guys, when it goes in this direction, the [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3285.2799999999997s)]
*  history of the league says it keeps going in that direction. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3288.7999999999997s)]
*  Samson was another one in the late eighties got traded to Golden State. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3291.2s)]
*  Oh, this will go great. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3294.48s)]
*  Oh, new team and his knees are better. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3296.04s)]
*  And he was out of the league in three years. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3298.16s)]
*  So the fact that he's just not playing basketball that much is [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3300.4s)]
*  historically a horrible son. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3304.04s)]
*  Um, next category, real quick though, did you think of any trade that you would go? [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3306.28s)]
*  This could actually be something, cause I don't even know how you would start [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3311.36s)]
*  the conversation. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3314.44s)]
*  No, the, the, I think I mentioned this on a pod a couple of weeks ago. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3316.16s)]
*  It's an all time bullet dodge by the Knicks. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3320.0s)]
*  Cause I do think they would have gone all in for him last summer. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3323.16s)]
*  And instead they went down this bridges towns path instead, which turned out to [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3325.88s)]
*  be way better thing, but I think they would have, I think they would have [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3329.72s)]
*  given up the goods for him. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3332.9599999999996s)]
*  I don't know if there's another team though. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3334.72s)]
*  I don't think there's a, you'd have to have a huge salary that goes the other way. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3337.12s)]
*  Um, it would have to be a pretty desperate team and it would honestly be [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3340.56s)]
*  irresponsible to, to trade for him with the contract he has when you don't know [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3345.12s)]
*  if he can play or not. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3349.2s)]
*  I wouldn't do that if I was an owner. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3350.72s)]
*  Would you trade Bill for him? [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3352.6s)]
*  So Bill three years left this year and the next two, but I get out of the [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3353.48s)]
*  Embiid business. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3357.68s)]
*  I mean, would Ishby do that? [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3364.2s)]
*  Of course. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3365.28s)]
*  But that doesn't solve my Philly problem because I'm taking on another bad [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3368.28s)]
*  contract, I'd rather just keep my fingers crossed with Embiid. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3371.96s)]
*  Next group, very valuable assets on very good contracts. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3374.92s)]
*  Number 53, Nas Reed. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3378.4s)]
*  Like he's one of the best contracts of the league. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3379.92s)]
*  Lou Dort, another one who makes nothing. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3381.84s)]
*  Norm Powell, Austin Reeves, who really should have listened to us when we were [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3384.32s)]
*  telling him the son with the Spurs, Derek White, Jared Allen, that's [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3389.28s)]
*  53 through 48. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3392.6400000000003s)]
*  Spurs didn't listen. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3394.0s)]
*  Next group is valuable assets on not as good contracts. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3396.04s)]
*  Move Scotty Barnes here to 47. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3400.32s)]
*  Next group is valuable assets on not as good contracts. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3402.7200000000003s)]
*  Next group is valuable assets on not as good contracts. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3406.7200000000003s)]
*  Thanks to his agent, Ryan Risillo. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3410.4s)]
*  Shangoon at 46, Markanen at 45, OG and Inobia at 44. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3412.76s)]
*  I just don't love the contracts, but love the player. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3420.48s)]
*  Markanen is the one that I think has been the weirdest one this season. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3422.6s)]
*  Cause he's just, his stats aren't the same. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3426.12s)]
*  You're paying him as a franchise guy who can, you know, last year he was winning [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3429.36s)]
*  games and beating teams, having best player in the floor games. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3435.52s)]
*  Hasn't really been the same this year, but I also wonder if he's just on [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3440.08s)]
*  cruise control and cause they're tanking. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3443.08s)]
*  Any thoughts or? [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3445.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I'm a little worried cause it, you know, it kind of gets back to that thing [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3449.12s)]
*  of like, well, if you've shown us some really high level stuff, then I expect [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3452.7599999999998s)]
*  that you're going to get back to it a little bit. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3457.04s)]
*  Um, and he's 28. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3458.7999999999997s)]
*  I would say there's some Chante George possessions where everybody else is [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3460.56s)]
*  watching that I don't love. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3465.2400000000002s)]
*  And then Sexton is talented enough to get his. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3467.48s)]
*  So now do they have like all these other dudes in hell when they bring in [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3469.7200000000003s)]
*  sensible and they bring like, there's just a lot of guys like it's go time. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3473.56s)]
*  And is Lowry collateral because it feels like there's less opportunities for him [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3477.96s)]
*  to initiate, or is that something that people have figured out with him? [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3484.0s)]
*  Um, yeah, I think it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3487.6s)]
*  yeah. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3490.28s)]
*  Who's the point? [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3490.4s)]
*  Who's his buddy? [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3491.0s)]
*  Who's the point guard on this team? [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3491.76s)]
*  Who's looking out for him and getting good shots? [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3493.28s)]
*  I'm gonna say nobody. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3495.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that would be the case. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3499.52s)]
*  I don't like, I still think that there's value for him and, but it did, I [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3501.1200000000003s)]
*  think it's a fair point in that last year, it didn't matter what, whatever is [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3506.2400000000002s)]
*  con whatever to the last dollar we can pay this guy is what he deserves and what [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3510.76s)]
*  he would get paid and everybody else would be happy to give them that in a [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3515.1200000000003s)]
*  free agent world. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3518.1600000000003s)]
*  And this season maybe makes you think of him as more expensive. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3519.8799999999997s)]
*  Well, and also it's two guys Golden state went after last year and didn't [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3524.96s)]
*  get him and Paul George and for what they would have had to give up for [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3528.8799999999997s)]
*  marketing, maybe, maybe you're relieved a little bit of your Golden state. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3532.96s)]
*  We'd been a ton of draft picks, giving up Wiggins, you're putting cominga in [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3537.8799999999997s)]
*  there and for what you've seen from marketing this year, not that he's not a [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3540.72s)]
*  good player, but I just don't know what's your destiny if you're Golden state. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3544.64s)]
*  If you're built around curry and marketing, I don't, I don't know where [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3548.4399999999996s)]
*  that takes you. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3550.8399999999997s)]
*  You're not in any different of a spot than like Phoenix's group H. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3551.3999999999996s)]
*  Oh, he's the toughest guy to figure out. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3556.4399999999996s)]
*  This group's called you realize he has a no trade clause and he's 40, right? [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3558.16s)]
*  It's LeBron James. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3561.9599999999996s)]
*  I don't, they're not trading them. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3563.2s)]
*  I don't think anyone's trading for him and it's a useless exercise. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3564.8799999999997s)]
*  Talk about him. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3568.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3569.48s)]
*  Next group. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3570.64s)]
*  Let me save you some time. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3571.48s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3573.0s)]
*  No. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3573.3199999999997s)]
*  Really fun group here. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3575.7999999999997s)]
*  Number 42. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3576.9199999999996s)]
*  Castle 41, Trey Murphy, 40, Josh Hart, 39 Dyson Daniels, 38 Desmond Bain, [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3579.52s)]
*  37 Darius Garland, 36 Jalen Suggs. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3585.64s)]

*  Uh, I I'm fine to admit that I'm over aiding Castle. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3591.16s)]
*  If you think I am, I just really like them. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3594.56s)]
*  I'm all in. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3596.72s)]
*  I have, I have a house on Castle Island already. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3597.52s)]
*  I'm I'm in, I'm, I'm completely in on that guy. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3600.6s)]
*  And the question would be, should he be that much higher than the [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3604.08s)]
*  other guys in the draft? [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3607.0s)]
*  In my opinion? [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3609.08s)]
*  Yes. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3609.7599999999998s)]
*  I think he's going to be a guy who could be a top three guy on a title team. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3610.32s)]
*  And I think he's a really nice person for the Wembee experience as we travel [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3613.48s)]
*  through it for the next seven, eight years, that's a guy who can win titles with them. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3618.64s)]
*  So I might over. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3622.2s)]
*  No, I, you know, I don't, I don't think it's cause here's, here's an example that [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3624.56s)]
*  I would use, like when we went back and looked at like Kaminga, right? [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3627.7599999999998s)]
*  You had Kaminga 83 and you had toughest omission, Tari Isen. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3630.2s)]
*  I would look at like, okay, I've seen the ups and downs of the Kaminga [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3633.84s)]
*  thing for multiple seasons. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3637.68s)]
*  So the idea that it's just going to turn this corner into something like really [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3639.32s)]
*  steady and that he could be a number two scoring option on an okay team. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3642.64s)]
*  For 30 million a year. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3646.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3648.0s)]
*  That that's now starting to feel like a bit of a reach with Kamingo. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3648.2s)]
*  We're with Tari Isen, even though it's raw or whatever, like he's out there [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3650.84s)]
*  just wreaking havoc on basketball games. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3654.48s)]
*  And because I haven't really gotten to see the full form version of Tari Isen, [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3656.7599999999998s)]
*  like he would still be more valuable to me just based on the unknown. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3661.36s)]
*  And then we know this game enough that like the unknown always trumps the known. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3664.36s)]
*  And that's why Castle is a hangup. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3668.72s)]
*  Even if it's not like the best vert, you know, cause whenever we see somebody [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3671.12s)]
*  young, that's this good, like, what if you can do this? [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3674.96s)]
*  What if you can do this? [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3676.64s)]
*  I don't know if he's ever going to be able to shoot it consistently, but I do [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3677.16s)]
*  know this, the guys, what two years removed from high school and he goes at [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3679.44s)]
*  like 30 year old dudes, like they stole from him. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3682.96s)]
*  He looks to fucking kill guys. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3685.6s)]
*  So that mentality and all of that, like having a dude out there that is [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3688.3999999999996s)]
*  completely unafraid this early, like there's plenty of young guys. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3694.2799999999997s)]
*  You're like, okay, he's just uncomfortable and he needs to kind of get through this. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3698.7999999999997s)]
*  There's none of that with him. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3701.72s)]
*  So even if the full arsenal of like all the offensive polish of even a guy like [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3703.08s)]
*  Vasell, I have no problem with him being this high because teams [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3707.08s)]
*  don't trade guys like that. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3711.16s)]
*  I agree. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3713.8799999999997s)]
*  I'm really interested to see what happens within the next two months. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3715.3599999999997s)]
*  And with San Antonio in general, because I actually think their record's [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3717.64s)]
*  lower than maybe it should be. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3720.8399999999997s)]
*  We all went under on them or I went under on them. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3722.08s)]
*  Maybe you went over on them before the season. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3725.48s)]
*  No, I'm pretty sure I went over because it was such a massive jump. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3727.6s)]
*  I think, did you go over? [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3730.92s)]
*  No, I went under. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3732.56s)]
*  I went under. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3733.96s)]
*  Just cause I thought the West was too good and I didn't see the path for [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3734.4s)]
*  them to be in the high thirties, but they're in a lot of these games and [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3737.56s)]
*  Wemby's terrifying and if Castle gets better down the stretch, who knows? [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3742.16s)]
*  Trey Murphy, I'm putting in 41 because I liked last year for him. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3747.2799999999997s)]
*  I think they fucked him this year with the contract extension. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3751.64s)]
*  Couldn't, couldn't really work out all summer. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3754.7999999999997s)]
*  I didn't know if he was getting it. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3756.56s)]
*  Then he gets it, got hurt. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3757.6s)]
*  Um, but if you've watched him the last couple of weeks, um, that's just the [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3759.7599999999998s)]
*  kind of guy you want on your team. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3762.92s)]
*  You know, he's, he's, I think we would have seen this earlier from him too. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3764.68s)]
*  One with health and just more opportunity. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3767.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3769.88s)]
*  It's starting to feel undeniable with him. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3770.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3772.6s)]
*  Now I, I kind of just don't want some of these guys to get in his way because [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3772.7999999999997s)]
*  I think there's an awesome version of him that's just waiting to happen here. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3776.44s)]
*  And I love them. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3780.48s)]
*  So if we ran a team, we'd be calling Griffin every four to eight hours. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3782.52s)]
*  You're like, ah, I don't know. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3786.84s)]
*  Maybe too many guys. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3787.8s)]
*  What about Murphy? [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3789.92s)]
*  Josh Hart. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3791.64s)]
*  I was shocked that I had him this high, but, um, the guy plays 42 minutes [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3792.6s)]
*  a game has crazy stats and he's indispensable on a top five team. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3797.64s)]
*  And he's on a good contract. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3802.32s)]
*  So I had to put him there. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3804.08s)]
*  Daniel's. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3804.92s)]
*  We both love being Garland sucks. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3805.4s)]
*  No arguments on any of those. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3807.4s)]
*  Um, this next group, it's three people. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3809.2400000000002s)]
*  It's called, if you tell Shams, I'll deny it to the death, but I have absolutely [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3812.56s)]
*  unequivocally, 100% listening number 35 Zion Williamson, number 34, Lamilla ball [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3816.08s)]
*  and number 33 BAM out of bio. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3821.2400000000002s)]
*  And I think BAM would be the surprise in that one, but I'm just [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3823.52s)]
*  prepared for anything with Miami. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3825.84s)]
*  I don't know what they do, whether they blow it up. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3827.12s)]
*  Who knows? [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3829.32s)]
*  Like is Miami hanging up? [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3830.36s)]
*  If you're like, we're here to talk about BAM. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3831.56s)]
*  I just don't think they are. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3833.12s)]
*  I think everyone on their team's available. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3834.24s)]
*  I might hang up on you and end the pod right now for having BAM in a [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3836.44s)]
*  group with Zion and Lamilla. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3839.6s)]
*  Listen, I, I'm sorry. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3841.12s)]
*  I could also put them in the next group. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3843.72s)]
*  Just put them in another group. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3845.6s)]
*  He shouldn't be in that group with those two guys. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3847.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3849.12s)]
*  I'm going to move them down just, just to keep you happy. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3849.64s)]
*  So it's so just the same ranking, same ranking number 33, but he's in the next [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3853.0s)]
*  group, which is called, sorry, we're pot committed here. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3858.88s)]
*  Okay. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3861.3199999999997s)]
*  Zion and Lamilla. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3862.56s)]
*  I would trade for Zion. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3867.2s)]
*  I would totally talk myself into he's in the worst possible franchise with the [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3869.0s)]
*  worst trainers and a weird fan base and a bad city for him. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3874.04s)]
*  We, if we just bring him here, it was the weird fan base. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3877.8399999999997s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3880.8799999999997s)]
*  If you're talking yourself into, Oh, if we could just get him, we can mold him. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3883.52s)]
*  He's the kind of guy that gets GM's fired. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3887.92s)]
*  Where you're like, no, no, we got to do this because once we get them and then [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3890.7200000000003s)]
*  three months later, he pulls a hamstring and he puts on 20 pounds and you're like, [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3894.48s)]
*  Oh my God, I'm going to lose my job. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3898.6400000000003s)]
*  Why did I do this? [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3900.44s)]
*  That's him. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3902.32s)]
*  I agree that I think there's a second team market for him just based on history. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3904.52s)]
*  This is like Darko and Orlando giving up a lottery pick for him. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3910.4s)]
*  Ooh, this guy went really high. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3914.32s)]
*  Oh, I do. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3916.08s)]
*  But wow, I didn't know it was that bad. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3918.24s)]
*  No, it is because I, it's done more than Darko ever. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3920.6s)]
*  I was thinking it was more like the Chris Weber or Mitch Richmond type of trade [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3922.68s)]
*  where you're like, Oh, you're giving us Mitch Richmond, even though it's 33. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3926.3999999999996s)]
*  Fine. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3929.24s)]
*  That's a better one based on production because like the Zion thing was, was [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3931.4799999999996s)]
*  really good last year and it's kind of like a little bit like the Embiid thing [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3935.68s)]
*  in that you go, well, if the market is this bad for this guy that I know I [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3938.24s)]
*  probably shouldn't be in business with, I'm still not going to trade him now. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3941.52s)]
*  And then I think on the other side of it, not that this lasted very long, but [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3944.88s)]
*  the idea that because of the contract, like would they waive him, you go, no, [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3948.52s)]
*  no, no, wait a minute, wait a minute. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3951.2000000000003s)]
*  There's a market. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3952.6400000000003s)]
*  There's still a market based on like the second team going like if it were [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3953.4s)]
*  Pierce and Antoine Walker, you would be calling in the EI being like we should, [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3957.1200000000003s)]
*  we should get Zion. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3963.2400000000002s)]
*  Like that's the kind of structure of a team where you go, they don't really [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3964.52s)]
*  have that much hope and like, I'm going to be excited and it's going to be cool [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3967.28s)]
*  to have Zion in my favorite team's uniform. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3970.1600000000003s)]
*  But that can be golden state right now. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3972.8s)]
*  When we're talking about like hail Mary, we have to do something crazy moves [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3974.32s)]
*  saying, fuck it and going after Zion that that qualifies. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3979.52s)]
*  Cause if you strike oil with it, it's an amazing, it's an amazing trade. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3983.36s)]
*  If all the good things from the trade happen, it's the best trade anyone [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3988.44s)]
*  could make this decade. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3992.36s)]
*  And yet it's probably way more likely all the other stuff would happen. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3994.2000000000003s)]
*  It's one of the toughest trade assets in a long time. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=3998.04s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4001.8s)]
*  But in a vacuum, like if you were running a team and let's [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4002.04s)]
*  I wouldn't trade for him. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4005.52s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4007.52s)]
*  But if somebody said you have to have one, like your owner calls, [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4007.7200000000003s)]
*  Hey, I just bought the team. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4010.7200000000003s)]
*  It's, uh, it's Bezos. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4012.48s)]
*  Bezos is like, we need to make a statement here early bill. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4015.6400000000003s)]
*  Finally going to give you GM job. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4018.6800000000003s)]
*  We're also going to have like behind the scenes. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4020.52s)]
*  You think, you think hard knocks was all access. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4022.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4025.04s)]
*  We're going to be, we're going to be waking up with you. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4025.56s)]
*  Okay. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4027.6000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4027.88s)]
*  And 24 hour running the team. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4028.4s)]
*  24 hour VR. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4029.8s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4031.4s)]
*  So you need to trade for one of the two, Lamelo or Zion. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4031.88s)]
*  I'd trade for Lamelo. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4036.48s)]
*  Lamelo. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4041.88s)]
*  I, that's another one where you can, he's a get coaches and GM's fired guy. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4043.44s)]
*  His destiny. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4049.36s)]
*  I made this joke many times, but his destiny might end up being an [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4051.2000000000003s)]
*  awesome basketball reference page and you know, Twitter, TikTok, Snapchat, [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4054.48s)]
*  one minute clips of this guy was a problem and that might be it, but you [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4060.92s)]
*  watch him on certain nights and he just seems completely unstoppable and like [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4066.12s)]
*  he can make any shot and you could get seduced by it. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4069.48s)]
*  I, if it was him versus Zion, at least I know he's probably a better bet to play. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4072.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4078.52s)]
*  Which isn't even a great bet. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4078.7200000000003s)]
*  I thought the all star voting thing was really interesting. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4080.36s)]
*  And then when I went to look at how it was happening, when you sorted his position [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4082.72s)]
*  for available people to vote on, he's the first option because he was leading [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4087.9599999999996s)]
*  everybody in scoring. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4091.3199999999997s)]
*  So I was like, I wonder if that would happen. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4093.3999999999996s)]
*  I got to give Tim McMahon credit on this one because he was on with [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4095.2s)]
*  wind horse and, and bond temps. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4098.08s)]
*  And he was like, well, his style of play has been in preparation of the all star [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4099.639999999999s)]
*  game, so he's a perfect fit if he's named a starter, he ended up not being a [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4103.28s)]
*  starter. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4109.0s)]
*  He should have been a starter based on what Mitchell Garland Brunson, all [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4109.36s)]
*  these guys have done. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4114.2s)]
*  I think between the two, here's, here's the issue. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4115.0s)]
*  Wasn't just the BAM issue. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4118.8s)]
*  I think that Zion and LaMelo should be behind group G. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4120.08s)]
*  I think they should just be behind it because if somebody offered you, [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4123.76s)]
*  uh, right between LeBron and those other guys. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4128.52s)]
*  All right. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4130.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4131.32s)]
*  Cause I mean, even though you can't trade Trey Murphy for Zion, if Trey [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4131.48s)]
*  Murphy were offered for Zion, the team says, yeah, we'll turn the page on this. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4135.96s)]
*  So the Pelicans call the Spurs and they say, we'll give you Zion for Castle. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4141.88s)]
*  And the Spurs say no way. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4147.6s)]
*  The smart answer is no way. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4151.72s)]
*  Okay. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4153.4s)]
*  I think you're right. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4153.8s)]
*  That's a good seat. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4155.16s)]
*  This is why you're a great trade value conciliatory. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4156.4s)]
*  That's a good note. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4159.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm like mad. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4162.0s)]
*  I, that's a good job by you, Ryan. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4162.52s)]
*  That's just a great job right there. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4163.92s)]
*  Um, okay. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4165.96s)]
*  SCP Rossello, she put me to sleep. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4167.36s)]
*  Let's take one more break. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4171.56s)]
*  And then it was, it was such a sad day in my career. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4172.52s)]
*  I was in the car driving home. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4175.12s)]
*  Listen to Mad Dog. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4177.2s)]
*  Mad Dog said it on the air. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4178.4s)]
*  Mad Dog shit on Van Pelt and I, and I was like, I would leave ESPN right at four. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4179.72s)]
*  I'd be driving the gym. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4184.52s)]
*  I would listen to a little Gottlieb. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4185.92s)]
*  I check out what the dog was doing and dog was like, that's me. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4187.4800000000005s)]
*  Pair of us. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4191.72s)]
*  Oh, put me to sleep. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4192.04s)]
*  Huh? [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4193.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4194.44s)]
*  There's no energy on that show. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4194.72s)]
*  And I was just like, fuck, I was going to do another Eagles rejoin. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4196.2s)]
*  Wow. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4199.4800000000005s)]
*  Scottsdale. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4199.76s)]
*  I was pissed. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4200.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4202.68s)]
*  The good thing is, the good thing is you let slight slight that you just [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4202.8s)]
*  forget about them overnight. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4206.16s)]
*  Don't think about them again. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4207.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4208.92s)]
*  Like it never happened. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4209.12s)]
*  All right. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4210.28s)]
*  33 guys left. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4210.52s)]
*  This is group B. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4211.68s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4212.68s)]
*  We're Pock committed it here. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4213.16s)]
*  Uh, Rossello demanded Bambi put in this group and get away from Zyada the Mello. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4214.68s)]
*  So Bamb thanks you. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4219.4800000000005s)]
*  He's 33. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4220.28s)]
*  Michael bridges, Kyrie Irving, Jalen Brown, who was in the teens, I think [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4221.24s)]
*  three months ago, and I think his dropped and we can talk about that in a second. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4226.76s)]
*  Franz Wagner, Kevin Durant, and then sub bonus. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4229.68s)]
*  And there's a couple of the contracts here. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4234.72s)]
*  Jalen Brown, four years left to 36. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4237.76s)]
*  Kevin Durant two years, 106. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4243.84s)]
*  That's this year. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4246.04s)]
*  Next year. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4246.52s)]
*  So bonus four for one 86. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4247.44s)]
*  Little pricey, but, uh, but that, what do you think of that order at a bio [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4250.16s)]
*  bridges, Irving Brown, Wagner, Durant, and then number 27 sub bonus, is that [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4255.24s)]
*  the right group for Durant? [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4260.92s)]
*  It is nudge them up. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4263.64s)]
*  I think it is the age and team performance. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4264.76s)]
*  But you know, if, if the rant were offered to the Pacers or Halliburton, [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4268.76s)]
*  would they just go, yep, no problem. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4272.6s)]
*  And we'll just have Nimhart initiate everything. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4274.4s)]
*  I don't think the Pacers do it. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4276.88s)]
*  It's too hard to find a guy who's like, I love being Indiana signature guy. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4278.24s)]
*  I think it would take a lot for them to trade them. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4282.16s)]
*  You see Durant may just not be into it later on. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4284.56s)]
*  All right. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4286.96s)]
*  That's fine. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4287.400000000001s)]
*  I love, I love this group because I think this is where it really starts getting hard. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4288.36s)]
*  This is where all the years, all the tape for you, Bill is showing up because [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4291.400000000001s)]
*  Kyrie, this is maybe the highest he's been in a long time. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4295.64s)]
*  Listen, I'm a second chance guy. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4300.56s)]
*  I'm a third chance guy and I'm even better than him. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4303.2s)]
*  I'm a third chance guy and I'm even a fourth chance guy. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4305.44s)]
*  Um, Kyrie, not one of my, not one of my favorites for a long time. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4308.04s)]
*  And, uh, he really won me over the last couple of years. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4312.16s)]
*  Fine. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4316.08s)]
*  He's a late bloomer, but, uh, I don't know. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4316.44s)]
*  I think this is the right area for him because if he's your second best player, [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4319.92s)]
*  you can make the NBA finals. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4323.16s)]
*  We saw that in June. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4324.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4328.4s)]
*  Mic'd up just leadership pouring into your ears. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4329.2s)]
*  Core coherent press conferences. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4334.48s)]
*  Hasn't done really anything goofy in about a year and a half, two years. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4338.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4346.44s)]
*  Well, yeah, I think we're coming up on what two years of him being three. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4346.799999999999s)]
*  Two anniversary. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4349.639999999999s)]
*  That should have been, that would have been a good anniversary for his pen to [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4350.32s)]
*  celebrate. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4352.719999999999s)]
*  It'd be a good 30 for 30. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4353.12s)]
*  Uh, you know, the Jaylen thing for Durant, do you think Boston says no? [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4354.599999999999s)]
*  I think they, I think they'd have to, well, that's why I had Durant 28 and Brown 30. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4364.32s)]
*  Because I think if you're Boston, you have the chance to get out of the last two [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4369.0s)]
*  years of Jaylen's contract and replace them with somebody that would keep you as [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4373.24s)]
*  competitive as you are right now, you'd at least have to have meetings about it. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4376.5599999999995s)]
*  If you're Phoenix, why am I doing that? [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4380.12s)]
*  Like I'm already like all the way in with this KD Booker thing. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4383.0s)]
*  I like, I can't really deviate from that at this point. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4386.28s)]
*  It's just feels low for Jaylen. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4390.24s)]
*  It's just feels low for Jaylen. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4392.28s)]
*  And I think because of this year, he's getting dinged too much. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4394.64s)]
*  Although, [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4398.0s)]
*  so you put him in the 20s? [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4398.6s)]
*  Yeah, but see that, but I like the group that he's in because Sabonis is incredibly [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4400.16s)]
*  like, like the stats with him every single time. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4405.08s)]
*  I don't even know that I blame the guy from Turkey for voting him for MVP. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4407.88s)]
*  Um, I know he wasn't from Greece or something like that. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4413.400000000001s)]
*  Like he might've just pulled up and gone like, look at this plus minus shit. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4416.400000000001s)]
*  Like, are you kidding? [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4419.6s)]
*  Like that has to be the MVP. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4420.32s)]
*  15 rebounds a game. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4421.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4423.48s)]
*  The Jaylen thing is four years for 236 in the last two years in the 60s when [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4423.719999999999s)]
*  we're in a second apron league. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4429.16s)]
*  Now it's just, it's, it's really hard to pay your second best player that contract. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4430.32s)]
*  I think that's why he has to be dinged. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4435.04s)]
*  It's not totally his fault. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4436.599999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4438.759999999999s)]
*  But like we were doing it before. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4439.08s)]
*  And so what was the Jaylen deal? [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4441.92s)]
*  Five years, what? [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4443.12s)]
*  Five years, I mean, it was like 280, 285, something like that. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4446.639999999999s)]
*  Now we're four years left at 236. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4450.36s)]
*  So it's just a crazy number. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4453.719999999999s)]
*  Cause we were talking, um, we were talking OG and an OB. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4456.12s)]
*  We didn't really get into it. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4460.32s)]
*  Like there's part of me that will always think like you had to pay OG and an OB [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4462.32s)]
*  five years to 12 fully guaranteed and give them a player option on the last year. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4466.839999999999s)]
*  And statistically there's some stuff with him. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4472.28s)]
*  You're like, how does, but when you watch him, you appreciate him a little bit more. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4474.36s)]
*  Certainly when he's been more available, which I think has been a fair knock on [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4477.88s)]
*  him in the past there, but you're right. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4480.92s)]
*  Like it's still 75 million light of what you're paying Jaylen. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4483.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4488.320000000001s)]
*  He's 49.2 this year, 53, 57, 61, 64 in the 28, 29 season. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4488.52s)]
*  That's alarming for anybody. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4498.320000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4501.76s)]
*  But the cap's going to go up and it's 65 million is crazy. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4502.04s)]
*  That number is it's 65 million for him at 32. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4505.28s)]
*  He's going to age well. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4508.24s)]
*  And at that point it's only, it's under 32% of the actual cap hit. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4509.76s)]
*  So I hope he ages well. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4513.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't like the fact that he's fucking jacked. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4515.36s)]
*  I think he needs to unjack. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4518.2s)]
*  I think he needs to unjack by about seven pounds of muscle. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4520.719999999999s)]
*  I've just seen him in person for two days. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4523.92s)]
*  I was alarmed by how jacked he was. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4526.44s)]
*  He looked like he should be with Jesse Ventura and Schwarzenegger and [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4529.2s)]
*  Carl Weathers in the predator movie. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4532.84s)]
*  That's like how jacked he was. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4534.599999999999s)]
*  And I just don't like that's. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4536.5599999999995s)]
*  Didn't hurt Kevin Willis. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4538.48s)]
*  We're a small forward. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4539.36s)]
*  Is Kevin Willis first team all time? [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4540.679999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4543.839999999999s)]
*  It looks like he could play right now. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4544.24s)]
*  Like I love, that's always the Fred Lynn thing when he stops by Nesson once a year. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4546.599999999999s)]
*  It's just, it's mandatory. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4550.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4553.08s)]
*  Mandatory that anybody that ages well, he can be 104 and be like, I get, that [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4553.24s)]
*  guy probably get you six innings right now. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4557.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4560.32s)]
*  You just have to be skinny. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4560.5599999999995s)]
*  It's just if you're skinny, they say it. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4562.28s)]
*  And a tan. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4564.28s)]
*  Oh, you're not, you don't have a pop belly and you're tan. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4565.24s)]
*  You can play right now. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4567.4s)]
*  Group D seven guys, budding franchise guys. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4570.12s)]
*  Tyrese Maxey, 26 Halliburton gulp. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4575.68s)]
*  Carl Anthony towns. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4579.88s)]
*  Number 24 job Morant, Brandon Miller, Brandon Miller, Jalen Johnson, and [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4581.04s)]
*  Chet Holmgren, who would have been higher, but he's had two major injuries already. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4587.32s)]
*  It's like 22 and I had to ding them. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4591.4s)]
*  A healthy Chet Holmgren, I think would be higher. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4593.84s)]
*  Uh, anyone on that list jump out to you in the wrong way or the right way. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4597.04s)]
*  Towns has been great for them. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4602.16s)]
*  Completely born to trade. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4603.5599999999995s)]
*  Still going to be a little bit worried about what the defensive alignment stuff [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4605.5199999999995s)]
*  might be, but when they're rolling offensively, it's, I mean, it's just [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4609.2s)]
*  an awesome one through five. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4612.679999999999s)]
*  The contract for towns, 49.2, 53.1, 57, 61. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4614.719999999999s)]
*  I mean, he looks a little hairy, but he's been awesome and there's no way he's not [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4621.44s)]
*  a top 30 trade asset where he is exactly. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4626.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4628.4s)]
*  Nope. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4629.84s)]
*  I don't think when, you know, as we get to the rest of the list that I've seen [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4630.2s)]
*  here, so there was nothing and I always could pick at anything. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4633.36s)]
*  I guess I'm just kind of wondering like, what is jaw right now? [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4636.2s)]
*  Well, that was the one is jaw too high on this list and should he be backwards? [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4638.759999999999s)]
*  Just because. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4645.28s)]
*  John doesn't play a lot. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4646.44s)]
*  And it's like these one off, then he plays two, then he's off one, then he's [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4648.96s)]
*  off three, then he's then he's playing three more. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4653.28s)]
*  It just seems like he's not available a lot. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4656.5199999999995s)]
*  And it makes me nervous if that's my franchise guy. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4658.68s)]
*  He's like, when Tatum doesn't play, I'm like, what happened to Tatum? [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4661.32s)]
*  He's not playing. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4665.36s)]
*  Like, I just assume he's going to play every game with John. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4666.5599999999995s)]
*  It's like, whoa, John played a month in a row. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4669.64s)]
*  Really? [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4672.76s)]
*  He's missed 19 games this year. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4673.08s)]
*  He played three games. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4674.5599999999995s)]
*  He played nine games last year. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4675.56s)]
*  And we know last year was a mess for, but they've been 19 games that he [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4678.0s)]
*  missed that have been spread out. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4681.56s)]
*  They're sprinkled out like two, three, one, he's definitely a, because [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4683.360000000001s)]
*  Memphis is, is on whatever priority. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4688.120000000001s)]
*  Like it's easily a top 10 team for me now. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4690.76s)]
*  Cause I just like falling in love with Jaren Jackson and in a new way. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4692.8s)]
*  Like I always appreciated him, but now like this year I get like excited to [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4696.400000000001s)]
*  kind of see like, I wonder how they're going to use them. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4700.240000000001s)]
*  Um, I love Jaren Jackson. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4702.4400000000005s)]
*  So there you go. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4703.64s)]
*  And you're right. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4704.24s)]
*  Like there's nights where I go, oh, like shit, Jaws and playing again tonight. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4704.84s)]
*  And so when you look at his style of playing, I know he's talked about, like, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4710.24s)]
*  I'm just not going to be doing the same type of stuff that he's in the second [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4713.5199999999995s)]
*  year of a five year deal for 197.2 million, but it, it makes it two major incidents. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4716.84s)]
*  Don't forget to include that part. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4722.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4724.88s)]
*  This, this is a lot like some of these other guys that we talk about, whether [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4725.88s)]
*  it's Tray's value to Atlanta, specifically Lamello's value to Charlotte, [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4728.84s)]
*  New Orleans going, look, if Zion's not worth anything on the trademark, it, we [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4732.56s)]
*  might as well just ride this out again and see that if he's healthy, because [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4736.200000000001s)]
*  the best version of him, like we can be a team that, you know, I don't know [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4739.04s)]
*  if dangerous is the wrong word here, but you understand like at least like a, [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4742.84s)]
*  a path of if we have all of our guys and. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4747.0s)]
*  No, we can get frustrated. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4750.72s)]
*  We can get impatient, but so many of these teams just kind of default [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4751.96s)]
*  to patience that Jaws Jaws, probably a hangup on almost. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4754.96s)]
*  90% of like, there's probably a few guys ahead of him that are hangups, but I [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4760.52s)]
*  also see people making, making an argument that at 23 he's too high because of availability. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4765.84s)]
*  If Memphis called Philly and said, we'll trade your job Moran for Tyrese [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4772.96s)]
*  Maxey straight up right now. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4777.52s)]
*  I don't think Philly does it, which tells me I probably should [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4780.0s)]
*  add job behind Tyrese Maxey. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4783.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4785.48s)]
*  And Maxey, you know, has missed a little time this year, but that was the, those [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4785.919999999999s)]
*  are the two that I put next to each other. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4789.879999999999s)]
*  The contracts, the same Max is only on the first year, but it's five years, 204. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4791.16s)]
*  Like I said, versus five years, 197. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4794.799999999999s)]
*  Maxey played 60 games last year, 70 games a year before that. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4797.759999999999s)]
*  He's played 37 to 44 this year. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4801.719999999999s)]
*  His shooting numbers are down, but really that to me is a product of him going, [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4804.44s)]
*  okay, and beads out and he's going to be a great, great, great player. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4809.08s)]
*  I'm just going to force the issue and he's taken a million shots. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4812.96s)]
*  He's taken more bad shots than they normally would. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4815.32s)]
*  So I don't look at his declining shooting this year as this alarming thing. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4817.6s)]
*  I think it was just, he's been good shot difficulty. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4821.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4823.88s)]
*  So maybe it's Halliburton 26, jaw 25, Maxey 24 towns 23. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4824.2s)]
*  I think, I think that's the order. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4829.96s)]
*  Cause I think Max, I think Maxey is a little more of a hangup than [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4831.64s)]
*  Jives from Memphis just because of the lack of availability and some of the [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4835.64s)]
*  stuff that's happening. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4839.32s)]
*  I mean, I could dingy cause of the hand surgery, but based on everything you've [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4840.2s)]
*  read about it is that it's pretty straightforward and that. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4843.4s)]
*  And Jalen Johnson, 21 you're good with. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4846.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4849.88s)]
*  I love Jalen Johnson. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4850.12s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4851.08s)]
*  Okay. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4851.639999999999s)]
*  Next group, three guys group C only if they made us do it. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4851.8s)]
*  Number 19, De'Aaron Fox, number 18, Steph Curry, number 17, Devin Booker. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4856.92s)]
*  You heard me correctly. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4861.68s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4862.599999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4863.32s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4863.88s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4864.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4865.24s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4866.0s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4866.76s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4867.599999999999s)]
*  Devin Booker, you heard me correctly. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4868.5599999999995s)]
*  Steph Curry, number eight is 18. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4870.24s)]
*  Here's the case. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4873.44s)]
*  I think you and I are probably among the two biggest Steph Curry fans in the media. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4875.799999999999s)]
*  Seth is probably third. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4881.639999999999s)]
*  Three years, 178 million is the number he's 36. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4887.32s)]
*  And if he's the best player in a pretty average team in the old days, that meant [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4892.96s)]
*  the team would have been good to maybe really good. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4897.48s)]
*  Now it means pretty average. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4900.28s)]
*  That's what we've seen. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4902.2s)]
*  I just think he's, I don't think he's at a completely different point in his career, [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4903.08s)]
*  but he's at a slightly different point in his career. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4908.12s)]
*  This, this version of Steph Curry right now would not have won the 2022 finals. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4910.16s)]
*  I think there's been a slight, slight, slight aging with him, but I also don't [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4915.4s)]
*  think they would ever trade him unless he went into the office and said, you [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4923.48s)]
*  guys have to trade me it's time. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4926.56s)]
*  So it's a tough. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4928.72s)]
*  No, when he, when he had the opportunity to talk about the [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4929.8s)]
*  trade market, he did the exact opposite. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4931.88s)]
*  Did the exact opposite. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4933.88s)]
*  Bobby Marks brought it up and we had them on not that long ago. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4934.88s)]
*  And it's like, this is what you want. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4938.0s)]
*  This is what you want in the face of your franchise. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4939.52s)]
*  This is the person that looks at kind of this lifetime professional relationship [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4941.64s)]
*  of like, Hey, what's the best way for me to handle this versus the worst way. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4946.120000000001s)]
*  And the worst way would be like Anthony Davis clearly did it because he [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4949.240000000001s)]
*  learned it from watching LeBron. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4952.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4954.4800000000005s)]
*  Where the passive aggressive trade request, our rosters. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4954.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4959.400000000001s)]
*  Well, you need a big band. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4960.72s)]
*  You have like five big on your roster. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4961.8s)]
*  I just don't think, I just think it's a ridiculous way to like operate as if the [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4963.8s)]
*  front office is sitting around and be like, Hey, do you guys want to be worse or [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4967.400000000001s)]
*  better? [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4970.04s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4971.16s)]
*  What about you? [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4972.24s)]
*  Like, what do you want to do today? [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4973.16s)]
*  Ah, I don't know. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4974.6s)]
*  Let's get lunch and then we'll think about it. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4975.4400000000005s)]
*  And then it's like, Oh no, the player said he wants us to get better. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4977.64s)]
*  All right. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4981.4800000000005s)]
*  Well that, that does it. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4981.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4983.0s)]
*  Let's get fine. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4983.12s)]
*  We weren't, we weren't going to do it. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4984.04s)]
*  We actually wanted to be average, but now, and usually that means you're forcing [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4985.4800000000005s)]
*  the front office. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4989.8s)]
*  If you have leverage, if you have an upcoming contract, you hell is these [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4991.04s)]
*  things, you're probably forcing the front office and ownership into doing [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4993.96s)]
*  something they don't think is the best thing to do longterm. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4996.28s)]
*  And, you know, LeBron's never cared about any of the draft picks anyway. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=4999.16s)]
*  So I think Davis is just basically saying the same stuff as him. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5001.72s)]
*  So Steph, there's, there's, there's no, I don't know, you know, nothing's [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5004.28s)]
*  impossible, but I don't know if that day is ever going to come. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5009.16s)]
*  Um, I only think the only thing that would make sense to me would be Charlotte. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5012.4s)]
*  If he wanted to like finish his career there, but that's just, you're [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5019.04s)]
*  punting on everything. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5022.0s)]
*  And I, I do think some people feel like relationships are really important and [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5023.04s)]
*  that they would rather spend the rest of their career, like understanding the [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5027.4s)]
*  impact of like, I was on the same team that drafted me, we won titles together. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5032.12s)]
*  I ended up retiring without, with some of the people I played with. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5036.32s)]
*  I think he cares about that. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5039.24s)]
*  So it's stupid to even have them on a list like this. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5040.44s)]
*  Booker was an interesting one because I have him 17th. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5043.44s)]
*  I don't have him in either of the top two groups. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5046.96s)]
*  You could make a case that he should be, but I just haven't liked that. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5049.16s)]
*  That team seems super disjointed and unhappy for three straight years. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5052.799999999999s)]
*  And he's the best guy on it. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5056.5199999999995s)]
*  And at some point, it, you know, he's 28. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5057.88s)]
*  Uh, I just couldn't get there, but I'm also willing to be talked into nudging [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5063.28s)]
*  him up if you think we should. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5066.5599999999995s)]
*  I just think he should be up, man. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5068.48s)]
*  Uh, I'm a huge Booker fan and I think it's been a bit like some of [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5070.2s)]
*  the stuff stuff that we've seen. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5074.24s)]
*  I think there's certain guys from an efficient standpoint, we just [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5076.12s)]
*  talked about it with Maxey where I can handle the efficiency being dinged a [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5078.12s)]
*  little when I feel like you are tasked with having to get your team out of so [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5082.4800000000005s)]
*  many bad possessions. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5088.360000000001s)]
*  And when I watch them, I think he's still, he's still the guy I trust the most. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5089.68s)]
*  On that team. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5096.280000000001s)]
*  So if that, I mean, let's run through it. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5097.360000000001s)]
*  Like you think of Jaylen Williams, well, the Jaylen Williams contract [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5099.76s)]
*  thing with OKC, I'm going to lose because of the flexibility. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5103.360000000001s)]
*  Let's go through it. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5106.64s)]
*  Group B, we can go through each guy and you tell me if any of them would [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5107.16s)]
*  trade this guy for Devin Booker. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5110.2s)]
*  So I'll move Booker up to group B. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5112.2s)]
*  So he's 17. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5114.64s)]
*  Number 16, Jaylen Williams. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5116.08s)]
*  I don't think they, I think they would rather have Williams on the [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5118.360000000001s)]
*  contract he's on younger. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5120.4800000000005s)]
*  His age is time to SGA and Chet and some of the draft picks they have. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5123.320000000001s)]
*  I just think they would rather have Jaylen Williams and Booker. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5127.320000000001s)]
*  As weird as that sounds from a basketball standpoint, it's also a team [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5129.36s)]
*  that doesn't really make trades ever. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5133.08s)]
*  So you're good with that? [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5136.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5139.5599999999995s)]
*  The contract, I can't win it. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5139.799999999999s)]
*  Todd's either have Booker just through the basketball player. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5143.0s)]
*  I'd rather have Booker play next to SGA right now than Jaylen Williams. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5145.24s)]
*  I don't even know how anybody would debate that. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5150.839999999999s)]
*  Hurts me on defense a little bit. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5155.839999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5159.759999999999s)]
*  Jaylen Williams doing, you know, between him and Dort, that's part, I think, [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5161.04s)]
*  what makes their defense so special is their, everybody on that team can switch [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5165.5199999999995s)]
*  in all these good ways and there's high end defenders, like SGA is probably the [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5169.599999999999s)]
*  worst defender out of their crunch time guys. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5172.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5175.4s)]
*  I mean, when you look at who they'll either attack, the other team will attack [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5175.679999999999s)]
*  Wallace if it's a size thing, or they'll go at SGA cause it's like the best of [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5179.0s)]
*  the options, you know, so you can avoid Dort or Caruso or even Wiggins, who I [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5183.48s)]
*  think is one of my favorite like underrated players in the entire league. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5188.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5192.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5192.4800000000005s)]
*  That's why it's so unfun to talk about OKC trades. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5193.200000000001s)]
*  Cause it was like, I like all these guys that wouldn't trade like, Oh, we got to [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5196.0s)]
*  improve the Wiggins spot, do you? [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5199.16s)]
*  I'd rather like see what I have with Wiggins and all these guys like playing [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5200.68s)]
*  with each other, which you got to value. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5204.04s)]
*  Like it's really hard to make a trade if you have chemistry like they have. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5205.52s)]
*  I wouldn't touch it. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5208.400000000001s)]
*  You know, Thompson at 15, it's a really fun basketball trade. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5210.6s)]
*  Thompson for Booker. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5217.360000000001s)]
*  I just, I'd be terrified to trade Thompson at this point. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5219.68s)]
*  I just couldn't do it. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5222.4800000000005s)]
*  Um, from what we've seen in the last five weeks to me, it's an automatic [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5224.400000000001s)]
*  hangup. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5228.280000000001s)]
*  I just can't do it. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5228.8s)]
*  I don't know what's there. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5230.6s)]
*  Like there's like the ceiling is opening up and there's like real [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5231.68s)]
*  Kawhi potential now there's Pippen potential now there's potential for [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5236.16s)]
*  all time guys when you watch him. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5240.320000000001s)]
*  This is, this is beyond just, Oh man, that guy's really good. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5242.56s)]
*  Like there's we're at another level of it now. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5245.52s)]
*  And everyone can see it. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5249.200000000001s)]
*  You could see it last time with the Celtics game. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5250.4400000000005s)]
*  He was the best guy in the game. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5252.12s)]
*  He's in a game with Brooks hits 10 threes Tatum's in the game. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5253.8s)]
*  Jalen Brown's in the game and Thompson was the most impactful guy in the game. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5257.64s)]
*  So I wouldn't, I would not trade him. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5262.0s)]
*  Uh, I would trade him for Booker. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5264.68s)]
*  You would. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5266.52s)]
*  I would. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5266.92s)]
*  I think, I think this is where, see, I mean, we, we raved about him at the [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5267.360000000001s)]
*  beginning, so I don't think anybody's in it, but he's 19% from three for his [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5272.0s)]
*  career Kawhi was 38% his rookie year. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5275.6s)]
*  I think he was 38% his second year too. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5278.44s)]
*  But how many years was quiet in college? [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5280.84s)]
*  At least three, right? [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5283.04s)]
*  Uh, yeah. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5285.04s)]
*  It's a Thompson's Thompson's at the stage right now where basically [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5286.92s)]
*  Kawhi was a rookie in the Spurs. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5291.68s)]
*  I look at Booker as a top 10 bucket getter and we've seen it in the [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5294.24s)]
*  playoffs, we've seen it deeper in the playoffs. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5297.76s)]
*  He's 28 years old and he's a motherfucker in the best possible way. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5300.64s)]
*  And not in a way that like distracts him from the task at hand at the game, but [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5307.280000000001s)]
*  I don't think he's afraid of anybody. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5312.280000000001s)]
*  I think when his, his level of like shot creation and scoring in huge moments is [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5314.64s)]
*  there's not 10 players in the league that are better than him at that. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5321.160000000001s)]
*  You know, I'm going to, I'll move him to 16. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5323.4800000000005s)]
*  I'll move Thompson to 17 and I'll move Jayden Williams to 15. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5326.4800000000005s)]
*  My only fear with Thompson is this was, it's like, remember that five weeks when [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5330.68s)]
*  Thompson was like, it looked like the greatest prospect of any swing man in 10 [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5335.04s)]
*  years and then, uh, and then he shot 9% from three in March. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5339.959999999999s)]
*  So I'm just going to be careful. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5344.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't want to put too much pressure on him. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5345.879999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5347.799999999999s)]
*  But it's kind of the weight of like, how often would we have ever said no to [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5348.0s)]
*  Booker for a men Thompson? [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5351.879999999999s)]
*  And it's like, uh, every day except for the last 12. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5353.959999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5358.639999999999s)]
*  It's fair. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5359.48s)]
*  Uh, 14, Kate Cunningham. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5360.28s)]
*  Congrats by the way. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5363.08s)]
*  I know, uh, I know you've been accepting kudos and plaudits for the last couple [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5364.5599999999995s)]
*  of months. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5368.44s)]
*  You never gave up. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5368.719999999999s)]
*  You were, I think, driving the K Bain wagon. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5370.839999999999s)]
*  It's been really special this year and his team's not good. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5373.36s)]
*  You know, they have some fun role players. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5376.639999999999s)]
*  They have some fun veterans, but the amount of responsibility he has game to [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5378.2s)]
*  game, this is the argument with the Mella ball. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5381.639999999999s)]
*  If the Lomel ball defenders would say, well, his team's not good. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5385.48s)]
*  Well, Kate's team's not good either. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5389.0s)]
*  And that team is going toe to toe night after night and has a chance to be a [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5390.6s)]
*  pretty fun playing team. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5395.8s)]
*  I like watching them and he's been really special. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5397.72s)]
*  So he's number 14 for me. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5400.72s)]
*  To carry this offense, um, back to the first part of this, to be able to do this. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5404.0s)]
*  I still would like to know over under, if I said it at five and a half number of [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5408.52s)]
*  games, Monty Williams is watching the post pistons taking the over the under [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5412.64s)]
*  way under. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5419.280000000001s)]
*  I think he's on an island somewhere. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5420.76s)]
*  You don't think he's watched six pistons games. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5422.64s)]
*  You just out of curiosity. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5425.200000000001s)]
*  You don't think he's checked in twice a month. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5426.4800000000005s)]
*  They should be an ABC sitcom where he has to live with Killian Hayes. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5429.0s)]
*  It's just the two of them in some beach house Aruba, just ordering the staff [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5433.200000000001s)]
*  around. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5438.72s)]

*  Uh, Evan Mobley, number 13, big win for me. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5447.04s)]
*  You had your victory lap with Kate Cunningham, huge victory lap for me with [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5450.76s)]

*  I kind of gave up a little bit. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5456.4800000000005s)]
*  Uh, and then Jared Jackson, number 12, would you, you would say no. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5457.88s)]
*  Let's see. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5463.120000000001s)]
*  This becomes a, I can't trade. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5463.400000000001s)]
*  Evan calves thing. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5464.96s)]
*  I'd rather have the size. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5466.4400000000005s)]
*  I'd rather have the size than the guard. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5467.84s)]
*  If I, if I have somebody who can anchor a championship defense and just picking [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5470.240000000001s)]
*  that, if, if all things are equal. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5473.64s)]
*  All right. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5476.76s)]
*  Like we've seen there's games when mobile hasn't played where the calves [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5476.92s)]
*  look just completely different, you know? [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5480.52s)]
*  And I don't know. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5483.2s)]
*  I, I, I'm really impressed, but Jackson, who you mentioned earlier, that's [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5484.88s)]
*  been the stunner for me, you know, this is a big win for Chris Vernon, who was [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5489.88s)]
*  always like, you guys that were always, you know, uh, shooting your wad about [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5493.76s)]
*  mobile, what about Jared Jackson who has better numbers every year and has been [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5498.4400000000005s)]
*  in more playoff games, Jared Jackson's been awesome. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5502.28s)]
*  And there's a, there's a fuck you to him this year that I really like. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5505.4s)]
*  Like I, that he had that Wemby game this year where he's like, fuck this guy. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5509.32s)]
*  I don't like this guy. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5513.44s)]
*  I'm going to go at him. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5514.2s)]
*  Uh, he's had a few of those this year. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5515.5199999999995s)]
*  I know the shooting number wasn't great. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5517.719999999999s)]
*  It's the only dude that I've seen like to your point, fuck them. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5519.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5524.88s)]
*  It's like, I haven't seen that since scoop in that international game. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5525.2s)]
*  All right, we're not dead. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5530.5599999999995s)]
*  Scoot. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5532.0s)]
*  Santa. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5533.2s)]
*  Lay. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5533.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5535.32s)]
*  I come over to my, they come over to my house and be like, is he sleeping? [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5535.92s)]
*  Uh, anyway, Moby Jackson 12. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5540.88s)]
*  I think that's the right order. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5544.36s)]
*  I'm glad I'm glad. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5545.8s)]
*  I was afraid. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5546.76s)]
*  I was afraid you were going to do Jared Jackson in the twenties because you get [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5547.400000000001s)]
*  in this case of the foul trouble and the rebounding. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5549.64s)]
*  Now he's had an awesome year. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5551.92s)]
*  When, when you think about what he can do offensively and the different ways that [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5554.4800000000005s)]
*  you can use him, um, I've never been as big a fan of him as I am right now. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5559.68s)]
*  I voted him as an all star starter and I know that wasn't popular. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5563.96s)]
*  Did you? [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5568.08s)]
*  No way. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5569.200000000001s)]
*  No, I, I ended up voting for Durant, but I stared at it. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5570.0s)]
*  I did Wemby, um, Yoke, Yoke, right. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5574.6s)]
*  And I looked at Durant, Jared Jackson for like a half hour. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5579.160000000001s)]
*  And I really wanted to vote for Jared Jackson. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5583.96s)]
*  And I just was like, ah, it's the all star game. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5586.24s)]
*  It's KD, you know, he's the vet. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5588.4s)]
*  And I just, it's not his fault that his team is run in the worst possible way, [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5590.76s)]
*  but I really wanted to do it. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5595.8s)]
*  I think I actually wish I had done it. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5597.04s)]
*  I think you made the right call. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5599.0s)]
*  Well, very few media members agreed with me, but there was still like when the [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5601.64s)]
*  votes came out, I was like, am I going to be the only one that did this? [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5605.6s)]
*  And I think there were seven of us. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5609.24s)]
*  I wish you had texted me because you could have talked me into it in like 20 seconds. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5610.92s)]
*  I was that on the fence. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5614.28s)]
*  But you know, we're all impressionable to a point too. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5615.12s)]
*  And it just, I caught more and more of him during this. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5617.719999999999s)]
*  And then you back up and you look at the numbers and you think about what he does [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5621.679999999999s)]
*  defensively and all these different things. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5624.84s)]
*  And I was like, I think it's close enough and, um, you know, standings [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5626.24s)]
*  isn't necessarily my tiebreaker. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5629.8s)]
*  And I think that'll not be a tiebreaker when it comes to the MVP vote. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5631.36s)]
*  If we stay on the same path. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5635.36s)]
*  Uh, and I, you know, I think, I think that Durant, like the default in LeBron [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5637.48s)]
*  and all that kind of stuff, like, Hey, it's the all star game. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5641.76s)]
*  It's about the stars and that's who fans want to see. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5643.360000000001s)]
*  Like I didn't, I wouldn't get mad about anybody doing that if it's close, right? [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5645.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5651.08s)]
*  If it's close. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5651.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5652.88s)]
*  The LeBron on off court numbers, when we had to do the vote, it was just, [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5653.16s)]
*  there's no way you could vote for him. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5657.04s)]
*  He was like a minus, minus eight, something like that. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5658.4800000000005s)]
*  Um, I think it's, I think it's a little, well, I did it this morning. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5661.360000000001s)]
*  It's yeah, it's minus 4.6. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5665.4800000000005s)]
*  No, it's, it's gone better. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5666.88s)]
*  Cause they're probably going to vote for him. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5668.52s)]
*  No, it's, it's gone better. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5669.8s)]
*  Cause they're playing better. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5671.400000000001s)]
*  Um, when we, when we had to do the vote though, it wasn't great. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5672.6s)]
*  So Jaren Jackson's played 45 of 47 games for the Grizzlies, which is awesome. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5676.2s)]
*  Um, and he's having his best season all the way. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5682.4800000000005s)]
*  He's 23 and six. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5685.2s)]
*  He's easily their most indispensable player and they're really good. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5687.64s)]
*  So kudos to him. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5690.64s)]
*  I have Davis 11. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5691.96s)]
*  Um, you saw the last couple of games, like he really big boyed Boston. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5693.76s)]
*  The game last night, you know, he's, if he's playing the right shitty team, you [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5698.040000000001s)]
*  really do feel like he could be a 40 20 guy. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5701.4400000000005s)]
*  He's been really good that a week ago. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5703.240000000001s)]
*  I was wondering if they should trade them to Golden state. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5706.0s)]
*  Now Golden state's gone one way and the Lakers feel like they have some momentum. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5707.92s)]
*  The Phinney Smith thing really helped them. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5710.96s)]
*  Like it, it feels like they finally have enough guys to at least guard perimeter [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5713.200000000001s)]
*  guys decently now, um, and they don't have to play connect as much. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5717.64s)]
*  So Reeves can be like the one guy you can kind of hunt, but that's it. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5721.200000000001s)]
*  Vincent's playing better. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5724.76s)]
*  And then LeBron's had a little more energy on defense, just a little tiny bit. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5726.52s)]
*  But, uh, I'm a little more hopeful for them than I was a week ago. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5731.88s)]
*  A week ago, I was like, this team's done. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5735.6s)]
*  They have no chance. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5737.12s)]
*  Super impressed with them in person when they house the Celtics. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5738.52s)]
*  I know people can point to the Celtics was at five and seven, but I just hate [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5741.56s)]
*  like how everybody just throws anytime any team loses, you're just like, Oh, [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5746.64s)]
*  back to back up, you know, look at this stretch and I understand it, but in the [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5750.32s)]
*  Lakers control that game from the jump and it's very clear. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5754.68s)]
*  And bullied them too. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5757.56s)]
*  It was, they knocked them around. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5758.400000000001s)]
*  I thought they were really physical in a way that was, was like inspiring. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5761.04s)]
*  And not that I went outside and started, you know, fighting people, but I. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5766.360000000001s)]
*  That would have been awesome. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5771.240000000001s)]
*  Was I wasn't that upset. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5771.88s)]
*  I wanted to get home and get some to eat because it was late, but I think [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5774.240000000001s)]
*  D'Angelo Russell just being removed from all of the possibilities and all the [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5778.280000000001s)]
*  possessions and all the stuff that he does that may not show up like, Oh, [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5781.88s)]
*  look at the shooting numbers. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5785.68s)]
*  Like, Oh, look at this. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5786.6s)]
*  And he has a better net rating than LeBron, all these different things. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5787.4800000000005s)]
*  It's like, yeah, man. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5789.72s)]
*  But it just, there's just times where, you know, like what the hell is he doing [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5790.400000000001s)]
*  right now? [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5794.84s)]
*  And so their best spacing closing group was the worst defensive perimeter group. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5795.32s)]
*  So they were kind of stuck. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5801.36s)]
*  And I think removing that removes some of the stuff with them being stuck. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5803.68s)]
*  And I, you know, it's weird with them because I kind of like them, but I also [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5808.08s)]
*  think like the standard is that when they're not a true title contender, they [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5812.52s)]
*  get so dismissed and then we're just like, Oh, they stink. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5816.76s)]
*  It's like, they don't, they don't stink. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5818.88s)]
*  Like there's seven guys there that I kind of like, but then I have to think about [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5820.4s)]
*  who am I picking them against in the playoffs in the first round and that [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5824.56s)]
*  becomes more challenging. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5828.04s)]
*  They're at least, they're at least a bitch in the round one. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5829.12s)]
*  You like that from that's where they've at least taken this season, the Celtic [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5832.12s)]
*  game, whatever there were real, the Celtics had weird coaching in that game. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5835.96s)]
*  There was a weird energy. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5840.12s)]
*  They'd played the OT game night before, but the Warriors game was the one that [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5841.04s)]
*  impressed me on that Saturday night because I thought the Warriors needed the [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5844.16s)]
*  game. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5847.4800000000005s)]
*  They wanted the game as national TV. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5847.76s)]
*  Um, I wasn't sold on the Lakers at all, but I did the same thing they did to [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5850.24s)]
*  Boston on the Thursday. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5854.08s)]
*  It was like, Oh shit, this, this team's big. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5855.4800000000005s)]
*  Davis is really engaged. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5858.32s)]
*  LeBron seems like he, um, kind of starting to like the roster a little bit. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5859.84s)]
*  And I really think Reeves who killed the Celtics has turned into a very fun [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5864.759999999999s)]
*  offensive player and that in red X, not afraid to run shit through him and [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5871.28s)]
*  marginalized LeBron for a couple, you know, half a quarter in crunch time. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5874.759999999999s)]
*  Like if, if Reeves has the right matchup, they'll go to him. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5879.5599999999995s)]
*  They'll actually use them, which they weren't doing last year. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5882.16s)]
*  The other hope is that, you know, LeBron defensively is going to be a different [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5886.12s)]
*  version of himself in the playoffs. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5891.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5892.88s)]
*  I mean, it's, it's terrible right now. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5893.08s)]
*  And it has been, I mean, there's just so many moments you can look at and be [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5895.8s)]
*  like, well, if he has to move, like it'll be times where he'll, he'll help to where [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5898.68s)]
*  the help doesn't need to be there, but at least it looks like he's defending [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5902.84s)]
*  somebody and it's like, okay, but now you just, you just messed up the entire [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5905.5199999999995s)]
*  rotation of the stuff and I get it. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5909.6s)]
*  Like he's 40 years old and that's why there was that weird stretch like 10 [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5910.84s)]
*  games in or something where they were winning games and he was playing out of [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5914.72s)]
*  his mind and his intensity. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5917.5599999999995s)]
*  I was like, what, what is this? [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5919.12s)]
*  Like, are you going to try to keep up this kind of pace? [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5921.28s)]
*  Like, this doesn't make any sense. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5923.24s)]
*  So that actually is a positive in that. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5924.28s)]
*  I wonder, you know, you gear it up. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5926.599999999999s)]
*  You have a little bit more of a break during the playoffs. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5929.04s)]
*  If you can see a more engaged version of him where defensively he's just [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5931.28s)]
*  trying to survive the season, play as many games as he can, you know, help [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5934.92s)]
*  them be kind of a mid seed team in the West. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5939.8s)]
*  I still think some of their best offensive possessions is when he's [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5942.44s)]
*  initiating it because it would make sense. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5944.88s)]
*  Cause he's so smart and he's still so good. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5946.84s)]
*  Well, especially transitions. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5949.12s)]
*  The other thing, his transition stuff is still great. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5950.4s)]
*  You know, like his ability to read at half court, Oh, there's only two guys there. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5953.36s)]
*  I'm just going to go through them and I'm bigger than them and I'm going to lay [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5957.08s)]
*  out, um, in the past, he still has all of his stuff. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5959.639999999999s)]
*  Think about it though. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5963.48s)]
*  How much, how much easier is to move when you know where you're moving, as [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5964.24s)]
*  opposed to having to move in relationship to the other person moving where you [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5967.92s)]
*  have no idea where they're going. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5973.08s)]
*  So when, when he knows everything that he's doing, it's still incredibly impressive. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5974.36s)]
*  And so that window of when he played that hard, even though I was like, man, [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5979.599999999999s)]
*  this, this dude is like, it was a bunch of games in a row. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5984.2s)]
*  It's like, he's really going for it. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5986.76s)]
*  I wonder like, if that's actually something to look at, we're like, okay, [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5988.96s)]
*  well at least that had happened at some point this season, even from that time [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5992.24s)]
*  on, um, yeah, I guess it's been a little bit better lately, but there was, there [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5995.2s)]
*  was a stretch with the Lakers have been up and down, but they're in a nice little, [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=5998.96s)]
*  nice little spot right now. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6003.599999999999s)]
*  Davis. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6005.6s)]
*  So this untouchables group, group B, Davis 11, Jalen Brunson, 10, Donovan [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6006.280000000001s)]
*  Mitchell, nine and Mitchell's had, uh, I just loved the year he's had and [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6011.52s)]
*  they're not playing huge minutes. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6017.04s)]
*  Um, they're these really deferred and, um, just seems like he's been an [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6018.6s)]
*  awesome teammate this year and I think he's the biggest reason they're winning. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6023.6s)]
*  Last group. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6026.72s)]
*  So this is a big argument coming out of the gate. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6028.320000000001s)]
*  This last group completely and utterly untouchable. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6030.16s)]
*  And I had Palo number eight and I struggled with that more than I think any [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6033.4400000000005s)]
*  other name in the list, whether he should be in this final group or be in the [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6038.68s)]
*  group that we just went through. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6041.64s)]
*  And I couldn't shake those first couple of games before he got hurt this [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6043.72s)]
*  season and how young he is and how. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6046.92s)]
*  I just wouldn't trade him. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6050.8s)]
*  I just, I just wouldn't be able to do it. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6053.12s)]
*  Like to me, he's a completely, utterly untouchable, but is he too high? [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6056.24s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6059.719999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6061.32s)]
*  And I'm glad you've had stretch. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6061.679999999999s)]
*  It's that stretch last year. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6063.5599999999995s)]
*  I think he's another guy that you have to factor in who was available around him. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6066.28s)]
*  Orlando statistically so bad offensively. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6070.5199999999995s)]
*  And that also speaks to losing fronds for that long on top of losing Palo. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6073.639999999999s)]
*  So I think there's a lot of people that could try to throw it and he's had some [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6077.759999999999s)]
*  dud of games, you know, some of the shooting numbers since he's come back. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6080.08s)]
*  I don't, I wouldn't say he's a hundred percent. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6083.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, I think he's a hundred percent. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6086.16s)]
*  I wouldn't say he's a hundred percent. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6087.44s)]
*  I'm going to worry about that in March. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6089.2s)]
*  What I love about him is that I know he can fill it up, but he also wants [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6091.44s)]
*  everybody to be involved and that's why I loved him at Duke. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6095.24s)]
*  It's why I've always argued for him is that, you know, the difference between [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6098.32s)]
*  a Jalen green can't see the way Palo sees the game. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6104.08s)]
*  And that's why I'm a Palo fan. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6108.28s)]
*  Would you have them above or below Anthony Edwards who have it number seven? [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6112.5199999999995s)]
*  I'd have them behind me. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6117.0s)]
*  Me too. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6118.44s)]
*  Well, Anthony Edwards is our number seven. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6119.04s)]
*  Taking some shit this year. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6121.88s)]
*  Little bit of a backlash season. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6123.16s)]
*  You knew it was coming. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6124.88s)]
*  You knew the backlash season was happening. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6126.24s)]
*  I was going to start with the Olympics. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6128.04s)]
*  Oh yeah, but it was going to have one of the Olympics like leading up to it. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6130.88s)]
*  After his run through the playoffs, he was like, I'm the number one option. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6133.4s)]
*  It's like, or, yeah, or you're going to be watching. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6136.2s)]
*  It's part of the process. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6141.5199999999995s)]
*  How do you handle adversity? [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6142.64s)]
*  How do you handle annoying media questions about adversity? [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6143.88s)]
*  How do you handle tough losses? [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6147.08s)]
*  We're fine. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6149.12s)]
*  Tatum number six. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6150.0s)]
*  Yanis number five. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6153.08s)]
*  Yanis is better. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6156.12s)]
*  Stop. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6157.64s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6158.68s)]
*  You're going to think that you're going to, you're going to be so happy right now. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6159.4400000000005s)]
*  Yanis is better than Tatum. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6162.68s)]
*  Tatum is the better value. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6164.32s)]
*  Okay. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6168.52s)]
*  Make the case. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6168.88s)]
*  Tatum plays all the time. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6170.0s)]
*  They're about the same age, right? [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6174.72s)]
*  No Tatum's, uh, what'd he turn 20? [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6177.12s)]
*  Tatum's 26. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6182.72s)]
*  So Yanis is two years older than him. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6184.68s)]
*  No Yanis turned 30 in December. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6188.04s)]
*  Tatum. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6190.0s)]
*  Oh shit. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6190.400000000001s)]
*  Yanis is 30. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6190.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6192.6s)]
*  Tatum turns 27 in March. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6193.0s)]
*  So when you sent that, I was, I was thinking maybe you were doing that on purpose because [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6195.96s)]
*  people are going to give you shit for the Tatum part of it. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6200.6s)]
*  No, I didn't think that at all. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6202.6s)]
*  I thought Yanis was 28. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6203.92s)]
*  There's not been a day. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6205.72s)]
*  Even the great ones make mistakes. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6206.240000000001s)]
*  There's not been a day where I thought Tatum was better than Yanis. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6208.76s)]
*  Although you're getting four extra years. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6212.76s)]
*  And I'll tell you like Tatum this year, man. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6215.6s)]
*  I think he's incredible. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6220.04s)]
*  Like I know the numbers may not scream it at you if you're not paying attention, but [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6222.4800000000005s)]
*  to see what he is doing to some of these defenses and what they're trying to do to him. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6229.84s)]
*  And like Houston last night, the entire thing was Blitzen double him and he was still [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6234.92s)]
*  turning the corner on some of these traps. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6239.72s)]
*  And it wasn't like he was scoring every single time, but there's, there's, there's not [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6242.6s)]
*  something like that. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6247.88s)]
*  It just goes, Oh wow. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6248.72s)]
*  Look at this jump. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6249.68s)]
*  Look at the shooting number, look at the scoring. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6250.52s)]
*  Cause the shooting for the team is down, which is another part of the Celtics thing. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6252.08s)]
*  This is the best Tatum's ever played. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6255.64s)]
*  I've never, um, you know, much like I was talking about with Jaren Jackson, like this [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6258.24s)]
*  is the best I've ever felt about Tatum. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6262.24s)]
*  And the fact, the age thing here is I think he actually be shooting [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6264.36s)]
*  ranked and heading out. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6267.08s)]
*  Two things responsibility. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6269.719999999999s)]
*  It's among the toughest in the league. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6272.8s)]
*  What he does every night. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6274.5599999999995s)]
*  Durability. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6276.44s)]
*  Um, it's surprising when he doesn't play. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6277.96s)]
*  And when you saw, and I had saw those back to back LA games in person, both teams [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6281.0s)]
*  strategy was just beat the shit out of Tatum, make them work. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6286.08s)]
*  Don't let him get to his, if he's going to get to a spot, make him have to shove [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6289.2s)]
*  his way there. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6292.24s)]
*  Always have a guy behind him. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6293.12s)]
*  Always chip them. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6294.44s)]
*  Like he's almost treated like the Pats treated Marshall Falk and that Superball [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6295.72s)]
*  that everybody's every smart teams game plan is push them, nudge them, shove them. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6299.92s)]
*  Just make it hard for him for four quarters. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6304.64s)]
*  Or like Ben Coats in the end zone. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6306.96s)]
*  Or my guy, Ben Coats getting tackled by four dolphins at the same time. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6309.36s)]
*  Um, but he just keeps coming back. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6313.64s)]
*  And that if there's a one disappointing thing with me, with him, it's just like [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6316.48s)]
*  when you play like the Clippers backups, that's the kind of game this year where [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6320.28s)]
*  SGA is like, ah, I'm going to have 55. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6324.0s)]
*  Don't worry. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6326.5599999999995s)]
*  Everybody can take the night off. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6327.12s)]
*  Tatum's missing that one kind of look out. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6328.64s)]
*  I'm scorched earth tonight. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6333.5199999999995s)]
*  But that's it. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6335.88s)]
*  That if you're going to nitpick, that's really the only nitpick where it's like, [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6336.6s)]
*  ah, tonight's the night where Tatum just scores 47 and we kill whoever we're [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6339.36s)]
*  playing. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6342.68s)]
*  He's just not that kind of player, but I think it's okay. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6343.28s)]
*  He gets everybody involved. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6345.92s)]
*  Um, and this is the best he's ever played. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6347.76s)]
*  We agree. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6350.080000000001s)]
*  I can't put him in a look at Don Chichet for now. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6351.4800000000005s)]
*  That's fine. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6354.52s)]
*  Although there's an availability thing going on there where it's not. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6355.4400000000005s)]
*  That's why he dropped. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6359.360000000001s)]
*  Like Luke has never been number one in the rankings and it probably might not ever [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6360.6s)]
*  happen because of the durability thing with him. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6365.72s)]
*  Whereas like Shay is number three. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6368.8s)]
*  I have Yokeage too. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6372.0s)]
*  And then for the first time, a new number one, we've only had, I think 10, 11, [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6373.64s)]
*  12 number ones ever, uh, Victor. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6377.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6380.8s)]
*  Not pretty sure. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6382.12s)]
*  Uh, Wemby number one, I think he has to be as great as Yokeage is having one of [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6383.68s)]
*  the great offensive seasons in the history of the league and is the best [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6387.36s)]
*  teammate since Bird and Magic and Curry. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6390.6s)]
*  And, uh, if you want to win a title, he'd be the first pick, but I don't know [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6393.5199999999995s)]
*  from a trade asset standpoint, the Spurs aren't even like, they're not, you're, [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6398.64s)]
*  you're saying the word, Hey, would you ever trade Vic and they're hanging up? [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6406.400000000001s)]
*  You're just getting the V in the eye out. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6410.120000000001s)]
*  It's a hangup. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6411.84s)]
*  So he's number one. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6413.0s)]
*  They're like, no, we were calling about a three way with Kretche. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6413.56s)]
*  Oh, they call you back. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6418.04s)]
*  So are you good with that? [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6420.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6422.200000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6423.120000000001s)]
*  I, I don't know where this Yokeage thing is going to end up all time because like [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6423.96s)]
*  this, this stretch is like so ridiculous. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6430.5199999999995s)]
*  And that's why when we were in Denver, I meant this, like, I hope he gets another [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6437.96s)]
*  one so that the simpletons are allowed to accept him into a higher tier. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6441.5199999999995s)]
*  And I know that sounds like shitty for me to say, but I just get so tired of [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6446.92s)]
*  like, when I look at how people rank stuff, like, do you really want to be [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6449.719999999999s)]
*  this simple? [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6452.88s)]
*  You just want to count stuff. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6453.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6455.28s)]
*  Like that's all it ever is to you is that this guy was good because of this and [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6455.56s)]
*  this guy was bad because of that. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6458.84s)]
*  Then what's the point of watching any of this stuff? [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6460.8s)]
*  Having a lot with college football, I thought this year too. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6462.52s)]
*  And I really hope like Yokeage gets the one that allows him to be talked about [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6465.400000000001s)]
*  in the way that he deserves to be talked about because of what this stretch is. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6470.24s)]
*  Would you put the finals MVP above or below resurrecting Westbrook's career as [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6474.2s)]
*  the greatest feat of his career? [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6479.4800000000005s)]
*  If you had to rank them one, two. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6481.52s)]
*  Westbrook, Westbrook, I was thinking about this the other day, and I don't [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6484.360000000001s)]
*  know if this is going to work, but like Westbrook's your buddy from home that [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6486.88s)]
*  just, you know, has it dialed in and everybody knows the routine, you know, [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6490.280000000001s)]
*  the girls probably maybe liked him when he was in high school or whatever. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6493.52s)]
*  But then if you bring him to like LA and you've been living in LA for a few years [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6496.96s)]
*  and you should be like, Hey, look, dude, just so you know, like it's going to be [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6501.4800000000005s)]
*  a little harder out here. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6504.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6505.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6505.88s)]
*  And they're going to be competing with like different dudes and like, it's up to [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6506.24s)]
*  you to accept the fact that like, you're not going to get into some places and [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6509.64s)]
*  people are going to big time you. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6513.200000000001s)]
*  And that if you recognize a guy from a TV show and you tell them that you're a big [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6514.4800000000005s)]
*  fan, he's not going to talk to you and he's going to walk away and like, they're [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6517.52s)]
*  just going to smell the non LA on you. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6520.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6523.4400000000005s)]
*  And you'll have to adjust. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6523.64s)]
*  And some people leave and never come back because they hated their experience. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6524.92s)]
*  And I think Westbrook showed up to Denver being like, I do get it. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6528.6s)]
*  Like I do. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6532.360000000001s)]
*  My hometown stuff might not work. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6532.88s)]
*  I find Westbrook in this run funny because he can be almost too deferential [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6535.400000000001s)]
*  where he'll like, want to get it back to Yoke Hitch in a spot where it's not even [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6540.76s)]
*  like a great catch for Yoke Hitch because Westbrook doesn't want to do all the [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6544.56s)]
*  things that he's been criticized for doing in the past. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6547.400000000001s)]
*  Now I still think there's a version of this with the spacing with Gordon and [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6549.52s)]
*  Westbrook to close like a playoff game. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6553.24s)]
*  Like, yeah, I'm allowing like, is that actually going to happen? [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6555.08s)]
*  But they needed him. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6558.4400000000005s)]
*  They needed him. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6560.04s)]
*  He was cheap. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6560.56s)]
*  He was, and he's giving them like value minutes. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6561.879999999999s)]
*  He gives them durability, minutes and stats. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6565.24s)]
*  They needed all three, but I think Danny Chow wrote a great piece for the [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6567.599999999999s)]
*  ringer about this last week. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6572.879999999999s)]
*  It's the most unlikely connection of any two players we've had in a while. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6574.08s)]
*  And for me, like, you know, as, as an obvious giant Yoke Hitch fan, this is [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6578.44s)]
*  like the stuff that made Bird of Magic so special, they could resuscitate guys. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6584.48s)]
*  Like Magic did this with Bob McAdiv, you know, Bird did this with Walton in 86 [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6588.56s)]
*  and even like bit players like C Cichding and whoever, Jerome Harrison. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6594.240000000001s)]
*  Um, but the fact that Yoke Hitch took Westbrook, who not only was not an asset, [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6599.8s)]
*  but this might've been the only team in the league that would have signed him. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6605.280000000001s)]
*  And somebody were like, Oh my God, how's this going to work? [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6608.160000000001s)]
*  Holy s**t. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6610.76s)]
*  And then turns him and they have this like real ESP thing now and Yoke Hitch loves [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6611.280000000001s)]
*  them. I think that's, I think that's such like a feather in his cap, just [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6616.04s)]
*  historically that he can, he can basically play with any player in the league and [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6620.5199999999995s)]
*  make them better, which is like the highest level of basketball you can reach. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6624.68s)]
*  Westbrook's really appreciated though. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6629.2s)]
*  He's appreciated more by players than he is by those of us that don't play. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6630.5199999999995s)]
*  Because I think they look at what he did at his peak and there is a respect for [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6634.6s)]
*  him that we probably don't understand as much, but you also realize with Westbrook, [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6639.5199999999995s)]
*  like which version are we getting? [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6645.04s)]
*  Because the LA thing with the Lakers was a disaster. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6646.92s)]
*  And I think he resented so much of the dynamic there, which I can even see his, [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6652.56s)]
*  his point of view on that. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6658.12s)]
*  Um, he was disrespected, marginalized and not used correctly and then blamed for [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6660.0s)]
*  everything and thrown into every single trade room or possible. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6664.08s)]
*  So yeah, he wasn't a huge fan. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6666.56s)]
*  True. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6669.16s)]
*  But I mean, it's not like he, like his style of play was going to lead to, Oh, [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6669.56s)]
*  this doesn't work. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6674.28s)]
*  But once again, the players expect to be GMs or sometimes I'm like, do you not [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6675.08s)]
*  watch league pass? [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6678.36s)]
*  Like, how do you not understand like how this is going to clog up some of the [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6679.4s)]
*  things that you'll want to do? [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6681.96s)]
*  Like, but it doesn't explain the Quippers thing last year, how bad he was [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6683.44s)]
*  no, because when it seemed like his career was over, right. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6687.599999999999s)]
*  The Dallas playoff series, when he decided to like prioritize just being like [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6691.08s)]
*  pissed off at everybody and taking himself out and like huge spots for you. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6697.48s)]
*  Like, what are you doing right now? [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6701.5199999999995s)]
*  He's a piss off maniac. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6703.32s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6705.04s)]
*  It's like, you can do like, you're getting us any buckets or anything. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6705.8s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6708.28s)]
*  So now we can't even trust you to be out there. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6708.76s)]
*  So, you know, you would think that it'd be easy for somebody to go, Hey, look, [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6710.4s)]
*  all you have to do with Jokic is just cut, man, be, be ready and cut. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6714.36s)]
*  And when you think he doesn't see you, he actually still sees you. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6719.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6722.679999999999s)]
*  Just cut. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6722.92s)]
*  And then it turned out Westbrook was one of the better cutters in the league. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6724.24s)]
*  Like who knew? [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6728.36s)]
*  We've been watching him since 2008 and all of a sudden he's like this [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6729.96s)]
*  supernatural first step cut, almost like a wide receiver coming off the lattice [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6733.68s)]
*  scrimmage and Jokic finds him every time. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6738.12s)]
*  We'll worry though, because there's times where you can see like in a game or if [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6741.16s)]
*  he has like an open look from three in the corner, and I know the corner numbers [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6745.96s)]
*  are really good, right. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6750.08s)]
*  But if he clanks it in a big spot, like the next time he may get that catch in [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6750.84s)]
*  the same look, you can see him just not want to, I've seen that happen. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6756.6s)]
*  So I don't know if there's numbers that will tell me that it's true, not true, [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6759.92s)]
*  but I've seen him where it's just clear as day. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6762.64s)]
*  Okay. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6765.4800000000005s)]
*  He doesn't want to pull the trigger on this. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6765.8s)]
*  And I don't know if it's like, Hey, I just brick the last one and this is a big [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6768.68s)]
*  spot. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6772.04s)]
*  I don't know if it's him being deferential of like, Hey, let me get it back to [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6772.400000000001s)]
*  Jokic. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6775.0s)]
*  I wonder with the Jokic Murray two man game in a playoff series, when you have [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6775.8s)]
*  Gordon, where you have that spacing decision that Minnesota always messes with, [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6780.04s)]
*  where it's like, Hey, put Rudy on Gordon because that way Rudy can freelance off [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6783.96s)]
*  of him. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6787.72s)]
*  That gives Nas the Jokic matchup that Kat did so well with last year. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6788.04s)]
*  Can you put, can you run the two man game if Gordon and Westbrook are both on the [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6792.52s)]
*  other side? [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6796.6s)]
*  And are you going to start like dealing with some real spacing issues? [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6797.72s)]
*  And will teams get used to it after two weeks of games where they're like, Oh, [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6800.24s)]
*  all right, game four. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6804.32s)]
*  And now I understand what they're doing. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6805.16s)]
*  That's the only thing that when I watch it, I go, you know, I wonder what that'll [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6807.0s)]
*  look like then. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6810.0s)]
*  But up until this point, it's been to your point for a team that we were like, [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6810.68s)]
*  where's the depth, just his energy and even like a diminished version of Westbrook [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6814.72s)]
*  athletically when he starts going and he realizes that kind of get the ball back [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6819.12s)]
*  because Jokic is just that good. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6823.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6825.240000000001s)]
*  It motivates you to be, be like involved in all of this stuff. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6825.72s)]
*  Like, Hey, if I keep cutting, I get just all these easy baskets because I'm still [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6829.72s)]
*  so much quicker, even though it's later in his career. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6833.400000000001s)]
*  I can't believe we just spent three minutes talking about Russell Westbrook, [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6836.88s)]
*  but it was totally worth it because it speaks to Yocage. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6839.599999999999s)]
*  Like the fact that, um, [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6842.4s)]
*  I look at what we did today. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6844.4s)]
*  I said, Trey Young was too low. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6845.88s)]
*  I took hard inside and something. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6849.2s)]
*  I was incredibly, incredibly concerned about that Denver team. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6850.799999999999s)]
*  And now I think they're fine and they're, they'll be there in the end. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6854.839999999999s)]
*  We'll see if they can get a buyout guy or just one other piece. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6857.599999999999s)]
*  Maybe they can dump Zeke Naji and have some trade flexibility. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6860.799999999999s)]
*  Anyway, group A Palo number eight, Anthony Edwards, Janis six, Tatum five, [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6863.88s)]
*  Donchich, SGA, Yocage in our new number one, Victor Wimbenyama, who probably at [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6869.96s)]
*  some point this season is going to have like a 40, 20, 12 block game with like [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6879.2s)]
*  seven assists is going to, he'll have some box score that we've never seen before, [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6883.88s)]
*  but we've seen 30 Yocage box scores. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6888.64s)]
*  I think I've never seen that before. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6890.96s)]
*  All right. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6892.2s)]
*  That was fun. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6892.68s)]
*  This is going to go up on the ringer.com later in the week, the official list. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fQDrBDCmCc&t=6893.2s)]
