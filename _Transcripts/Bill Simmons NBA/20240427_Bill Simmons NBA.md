# Paolo Banchero Vs. Chet Holmgren Discussion | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zU1m8Mc5WEA)
*  A funny thing that we were talking about that Kevin and I were talking about was the Palo
*  versus Chet thing.
*  Like, I know Saruti is going to come strangle me for this, but you hear a lot of people
*  talk about that and I haven't moved at all.
*  Like it's a done deal that Palo is a better pick?
*  I don't know where you are on that, but I haven't moved on that at all.
*  I still have Chet one in that class.
*  Oh wow.
*  It's a great argument.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  Where are you on that?
*  I'm like pushing Palo off a cliff.
*  I just prefer Chet and his two-way offerings and spacing and passing and stuff like that.
*  I still think Chet is ultimately going to be the better player.
*  I mean, I famously, I wanted Chet.
*  I went on the KOC.
*  I went everywhere and I was like, I love Chet.
*  So the fact that both of them are good, I feel like is a W for me.
*  So I'll take that.
*  But I keep coming back to, I think both teams got the exact guy that they needed.
*  I think Orlando, we needed a guy who just was like, screw it, give me the ball.
*  I don't care.
*  And I'm going to be maybe a little inefficient, but I'm not afraid.
*  And I am definitely a one.
*  And OKC didn't need that guy.
*  Like, I don't think if you swap these two guys, I don't think it works actually.
*  Like, I don't know how much SGA works Palo and I don't know that Orlando, I don't know
*  that Chet would be good.
*  He'd be great.
*  But he's not like a number one option on a team that's, you know, that just want to
*  play off game by like 30 something points.
*  So I think everybody's happy.
*  I think that's the right answer.
*  I also don't think we have an answer yet because I want to see how these guys evolve over
*  the next four years.
*  I will say this.
*  I think what Chet does translates more to a team with a higher ceiling than maybe the
*  Palo version of it, because I think Palo is just like, if you have Palo, he's your best
*  player.
*  And if you win the title, he's going to be the number one guy, a little like Tatum.
*  Whereas Chet, I think he could kind of be the second, third or or best player potentially
*  on a team, depending on who's on the team.
*  He's such a unique asset.
*  I just can't believe like that he's able to hold the fort against Valenshunis.
*  Like I even at the trade deadline, I was going nuts that didn't get a center.
*  But as Kyle said earlier, like, yeah, he'll look bad five times in a game where you're
*  like, oh man, that looked awful.
*  But he comes right back.
*  He just puts his head down.
*  He runs back and he'll make a three.
*  I love how competitive he is.
*  And it ties into what people saw when he was in AAU five, six years ago when everybody
*  was coming at him and trying to dunk on him and test him.
*  And he just always came back.
*  So it's a tough one.
*  I guess the question for me is, and maybe Kyle, maybe you can answer this as a neutral
*  party.
*  What is Palo's ceiling?
*  Is his ceiling top three MVP candidate?
*  Is it first team on BA?
*  Is it 30 and 12 a game?
*  Because if it's that high, then he's probably the ultimate answer to the question.
*  I don't know if Chet's ever going to be like a top three player in the league.
*  I would doubt that.
*  But Kyle, do you think he has the chance to be a top four MVP candidate?
*  Because I would say I'd lean toward yes over no on that.
*  Yeah, he kind of feels like high all NBA ish sort of ceiling to me.
*  Like I've said that I thought that his developmental path would kind of be similar to Blake
*  Griffin's because they have the same kind of tilt in their game.
*  Whereas like they played in different eras where if Blake had played now, he probably
*  would have played more facing the basket.
*  He was so post-up dominant early in his career.
*  But they kind of I feel like they're going to end up similar places where they both can
*  kind of pass the ball.
*  The shooting is like every once in a while, it's OK.
*  But to answer your question, I mean, I don't know about top three in the league.
*  I'm not I'm not sure about that.
*  But I do think that like second dish flirt with first team all NBA, which is hardly an
*  insult to me.
*  So like, yeah, basically Tatum range.
*  Yeah, I think that's fair.
*  Yeah, I think that's fair.
*  I mean, I don't know if Tatum gets higher than where he is right now, unless there's
*  one last thing he can add to his game that he doesn't have yet.
*  But to me, he's getting closer to a finished product than maybe I felt before the season.
*  Really quickly, the Apollo thing like he.
*  You saw it today, like his tough shot making ability and like, yeah, the efficiency is
*  always going to be, you know, it's going to improve.
*  I mean, he's in the second year and it's his first playoff series.
*  So I got his 21ers.
*  Yeah.
*  And let his team points, rebounds and assists.
*  I'm the best guy ever do that.
*  So that to me, those things that he does like check, I don't know that Chet ever does
*  Chet's an incredible secondary piece to me.
*  But does that matter?
*  Right.
*  I think it does because, you know, like he's already a really good playmaker.
*  I mean, I know like people are going to throw the turnovers in his face.
*  I don't know.
*  It was two road games.
*  He doesn't have a point guard.
*  Like it's your first playoff.
*  So I got too cool.
*  You have zero turnovers.
*  So like, I don't know the shots he was hitting tonight.
*  You're like, I just got, there's not a lot of guys in the league.
*  Yeah, I guess his destiny Chet's destiny would be like the Anthony Davis piece on a
*  title team.
*  And Palo's destiny could be, can it be the best player on a finals team?
*  Something like that.
*  Could I, could I get to that Durant Tatum territory, which I think at the age he's
*  at with some of the stuff we've seen already, it's a great argument.
*  It's amazing that this isn't even close to being a finished argument yet.
*  Usually after the second year, we kind of know who should win the first pick.
*  But in this case, I I'm not positive.
*  We know yet anyway,
*  so so much bar stock.
*  So like, oh, it's great.
*  The funny thing is Jabari was also a really good pick.
*  And maybe this maybe this actually worked out perfectly.
*  I hope we say the same about the football quarterbacks in the draft today.
*  Seruti where it's like, oh man, looking back.
*  Yeah, Caleb's the best, but man, Drake may really good pick at number three.
*  Maybe Pettis will be awesome.
*  Who knows?
*  You know, it's going to be great.
*  Like plot twist the ball.
*  He actually is a guy.
