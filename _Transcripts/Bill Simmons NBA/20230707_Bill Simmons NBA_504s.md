# Will James Harden Stay in Philadelphia? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [July 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3M90aQyVe0)
*  Now it's out. This is what we said on Sunday.
*  Darrell is not a guy who trades a star for parts.
*  Right.
*  How does this play out?
*  You have James Harden now who's played at what?
*  14, 15 million less than he was worth last year.
*  Apparently had to do that again this year.
*  And Darrell's doing the hardball thing, but he's doing hardball.
*  This time it's not with Ben Simmons, who's 24 years old, coming off in all
*  defense season, all that stuff.
*  This is James Harden, who wasn't awesome in the playoffs, who seems like
*  he's aging, not that great, who makes a fair amount of money.
*  And I don't think other teams and they're like, oh, cool.
*  Here's our top 40 for yours.
*  So what happens?
*  I think he goes back to the Sixers.
*  I really do.
*  I mean, I, and I'll tell you what, it's been such a weird week.
*  I had this epiphany where it's like, we've done all these podcasts about,
*  well, you know, you want Norman Powell and Terrence Mann or you want to do this
*  or you want to do that.
*  And it goes, it starts at Paul George and then you start talking yourself
*  into all these other things.
*  And I saw all these pictures from Michael Rubin's white party.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's just Harden with Joel, Maxie, Tobias and hanging out with Josh Harris,
*  who owns the team and looking like he's having a blast.
*  And I'm like, do I take this stuff too seriously?
*  Yeah.
*  And like, is he just going to be back?
*  And like, or do we all like kind of put all of this psychology onto these trades
*  and onto these trade demands where it's like, like, are they just going to take
*  him back and that's fine?
*  And there's just going to come back on a, what, a two plus one or something like that.
*  They can't extend him now though, is the problem.
*  Right.
*  Well, he'll opt in, but like.
*  He already opted in.
*  Yeah, I know he'll opt in, but is he going to like.
*  They wink, wink it.
*  Yeah.
*  And is it going to be one of those things where he basically like, is he going to show
*  up 30 pounds overweight and pretend like his hamstrings torn like he did with the
*  last two teams he played for, or is this actually going to just be, you know what?
*  We tested the market.
*  Maybe feelings got hurt, but it seems like we've all like water into the bridge and
*  let's try it again.
*  And that seems like what it's going to be.
*  So you're saying his prior history of basically completely tanking torpedoing two
*  different teams has you a little worried.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  Okay.
*  But it also seems like maybe like when we watch these trade demands take place in
*  public, like the Lillard thing or whatever, then it's like behind the scenes, it's
*  much more professional in business than, than we'd like to think it is.
*  I think because the fans have such personal investment in the teams that we think
*  it's all heartbreak, but it's not.
*  I think maybe it's just like Harden's just going to come back and be like,
*  Oh, well I tried, you know, and he'll be like, no big deal.
*  Come on back, James.
*  But that happened last year with Durant.
*  Of course it did.
*  Yeah.
*  Where he kind of came back and it was like.
*  I tried to get the coach fired.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  Sorry, everybody.
*  Let's go.
*  Let's play some ball.
*  I think the difference, and this is why I think with Portland, with the Dames
*  situation, they don't end up trading them this summer.
*  Certain you're, you're leveraging somebody's love for their sport.
*  Kind of against them.
*  Yes.
*  Where KD, he just likes basketball too much.
*  He wasn't going to sit out until they traded him.
*  He, he respects the game too much.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think Dame is, is wired the same way.
*  So Portland knows they have that.
*  I did think there was that, that part in that Woe story today about where
*  Aaron Goodman's like, be careful.
*  Yeah.
*  You're trading for an unhappy player.
*  You're not an unhappy guy.
*  It's like, okay, that's fine.
*  But I, I just think Dame loves basketball.
*  Whereas Harden, I'm not sure sometimes.
*  Right.
*  And that's where it gets dangerous for Philly because you have this Embiid window
*  and Harden could say whatever he wants now, but what happens if he comes back in
*  October, he's 30 pounds overweight.
*  Right.
*  He starts pulling the James Harden stuff and now you've lost another.
*  Or if he just like winds up playing for Nick Nurse and Nick Nurse is like, you
*  have to move without the ball.
*  And he's just like, I don't know if you've seen my tape.
*  I don't do that.
*  You know, like that, like that'll be, that'll be like a real like rubber
*  hits the road moment for the team.
*  Are we sleeping on the Nick Nurse piece of this too?
*  You know, the guy won the title.
*  Yeah.
*  I, he might be-
*  You mean to fix him?
*  No, just in general.
*  Like when was the last time you had like a really good, innovative coach?
*  Yeah.
*  And well, he also, Nick Nurse comes from like the Houston, he was a
*  Houston G League or D League coach back in the day.
*  It comes from the Darrell School of Thought.
*  Like there is presumably an idea there where they're like, we know how to
*  maximize James in a way that Doc maybe didn't.
*  Would you see like he's coaching your G League team?
*  I love Doc.
*  Doc's not coaching the G League team.
*  I know.
*  Doc's like, Hey man, I'm going away.
*  Let me know how it goes.
*  Send me some clips.
*  I know.
*  Uh, Nick Nurse is-
*  James Sprayer, who's like a big like Sixers fan favorite.
*  Like we're like, why didn't Doc ever play this kid?
*  Yeah.
*  He's like, yeah, you know, Nick was out there stopping drills, showing
*  us how to do things differently.
*  I had never had that before.
*  And it's like, oh shit.
*  That's hilarious.
*  We had, we were in that with Doc with the Celtics.
*  There was this Rondo's first year when we were terrible and he just really
*  didn't play Rondo that much and we were like, wait, there's something here
*  with that Rondo guy and didn't really fully understand it and then Rondo,
*  they needed him and he became Rondo.
*  But he's that old generation of like, prove to me, I think Steve Kerr's like this.
*  Roll the ball out.
*  Yeah.
*  Hey rookie, prove to me you can earn minutes on my court and play
*  defense, do all the right things.
*  I think you're right.
*  I think a combination of Darrell's stubbornness and the fact that the
*  media and our whole culture of how we deal with this stuff probably blows
*  this stuff out a little bit.
*  Yeah.
*  Harden opting in, hoping to force Philly's hand, but also knowing he's
*  not getting that money anywhere else.
*  None of the principles in this story have given like an on record interview
*  where they're like, here's what's happened.
*  This is all conjecture.
*  It's all sources say it's all like reporting with it from anonymous sources
*  about Harden's camp, Sixers camp, whatever.
*  Yeah.
*  So I don't really don't know what the truth is in this.
*  You know, it sounds like Harden made a pretty impulsive decision to opt in,
*  you know, without knowing that he didn't have the Houston offer.
*  It sounds like he opted in to just be like, well, fuck you guys, you guys
*  figure it out, you know, like I don't want to be here now trade me to the
*  Clippers, but.
*  It'd be funny if he opted in at like two in the morning.
*  He'd been out all night.
*  He's got some opting in.
*  And then the next day he's like, what did I do?
*  It's like buying something on Instagram.
*  You're just like, I opt in.
*  I have an app.
*  It's like when you buy something on eBay or something, the next day you're
*  like, wait, I just bought the entire Godfather set on Blu-ray.
*  I already have it.
*  I don't have a Blu-ray player anymore.
*  Uh, yeah, I wonder if, uh, it gets a little heated.
*  There's some posturing, but ultimately he stays and if he stays, it's great
*  for Philly, you got him at a good price.
*  Yeah.
*  You don't have to pay them longterm.
*  Um, you, somebody was talking recently about like the, the longer this goes on.
*  The more the, the Clippers come into play, I think where it's like, maybe they
*  start thinking more about, do we really want to run this back?
*  Because I think Zach and Hollander were talking about this where the Clippers
*  haven't done anything and that like, as the Western conference teams get stronger
*  and stronger, especially the Lakers, they might have to look in the mirror and be
*  like, so we're just going to do this again, but without Eric Gordon.
*  Right.
*  And, and basically hope that this is the year those two guys stay healthy.
*  I think I did that in the first segment about Ballmer, um, that there's
*  desperation with them.
*  There's some, there's some on the clock stuff this year, but with them it's.
*  Will the fan base accept, all right, year five, maybe this will be the year
*  everything falls into place.
*  And I think, I think the partner would be a great Clipper.
*  I honestly do.
*  I think he was like, he's like, it's the perfect player for the franchise.
*  Well, if you, if you were able to get Powell and Mann and like two of their
*  firsts for James Harden, like some 130 cents of the dollar trade.
*  Yes.
*  This is what I was like for Simmons too.
*  So I think I'm in the minority of Sixers fans where I would have been fine with
*  like CJ McCollum and some other stuff or, you know, I obviously Halliburton would
*  have been the dream in retrospect, but I'm fine with Harden for Terrence Mann
*  and Norm Powell, you know, like that to me actually works pretty well with
*  in the Sixers like Terrence Mann and Tyrese Maxey as a back court sounds pretty good.
*  Yeah.
*  All the Clipper fans loved him.
