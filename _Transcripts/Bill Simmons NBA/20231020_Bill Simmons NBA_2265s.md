# NBA Southwest Division Has Some Weird Teams | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [October 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8)
*  All right, we're moving to the southwest [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=0.0s)]
*  This pods about to go on tilt. There are some weird teams in this division. We'll start with the Memphis Grizzlies [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=3.08s)]
*  45 and a half is the over-under for them. They went 51 and 31 last year [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=10.28s)]
*  They've been one of the most consistent reliable regular season teams we have [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=14.72s)]
*  Really the only big thing they did was they they brought in Marcus smart [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=19.8s)]
*  There's a Derek Rose thing that people are excited about that [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=24.96s)]
*  I'm not even gonna acknowledge because he hasn't been a [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=28.08s)]
*  Rotation to be a guy in two years their depth is a little weaker and they don't have Ja [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  For 25 games, which seems relevant for the over-under [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=37.4s)]
*  45 and a half seems too high for me because [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=42.76s)]
*  There's a Marcus smart guys. I got this until Ja comes back that I just watched Marcus smart for 10 years [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=46.08s)]
*  Guess what? He doesn't have it [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  I'll hold my thought. What are your what are your quick thoughts on the Grizzlies Marcilla? I [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=55.48s)]
*  Want to like them more but it was weird a couple years ago in that Golden State series word [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=61.72s)]
*  Yeah, Ja like started hinting at like wait a minute. What's up with you? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=66.92s)]
*  Remember he was like that's a code break and it's like nobody touched you [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=71.28s)]
*  Yeah, and then it was like they talked all this shit [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=74.6s)]
*  But then when they would lose they couldn't do anything and then that carried over to the Dylan Brooks thing [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=76.92s)]
*  It can't all be Dylan Brooks fuck no, no, but he's gone so, you know, whatever [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=80.76s)]
*  And they weren't healthy like they were very very unhealthy [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=85.88000000000001s)]
*  Like if that team were healthy and there wasn't all the job bullshit. I don't know if they lose that series of Lakers, you know [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  Last couple years without Ja 21 22 they went 20 and 5 [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  They went 11 and 10 without him last year. I think the defensive numbers. It's been born than a small sample [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=102.64s)]
*  They're kind of better defensively [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=108.08000000000001s)]
*  Without him and I think they're all I'm going over here despite [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=110.76s)]
*  Despite some personality stuff with the team where I'd like it just to mature [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  I also think the 25 game suspension looking is really excessive [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=119.68s)]
*  But that's doesn't seem to be a popular opinion Wow [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=124.36s)]
*  It's a lot. It feels like there was some sort of breach with the league and if there's more to it that I don't know [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=128.44s)]
*  But if it seems like a lot but again in the moment you it's really hard to be the guy be like [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=135.32s)]
*  Hey, this is really stupid. He shouldn't be doing this. I think 25 games is an insane number [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  But they have a good track record without him and I still I still like this team when they're healthy [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=145.48s)]
*  I think they've done a really good job with the depth of talent here. So I'm going over [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=150.88s)]
*  Despite I just want to see I want to see this team post Brooks jaw coming back. I just want to see him be like [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=155.56s)]
*  The young fun team. Okay now now now be the grown-up team that beats other teams [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=163.39999999999998s)]
*  We got house over I like Memphis. Okay, I like the depth [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=169.26s)]
*  This is one of our big disagreements so far the point that [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=173.9s)]
*  Rossello made about their their defensive numbers and their competitiveness defensively [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=177.42000000000002s)]
*  especially at the beginning of the season during the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=182.82s)]
*  Suspension this is when they go out and catch some bodies. We didn't get a real good feel for what the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=185.86s)]
*  He's laughing. No, we're in agreement the Luke canard bit [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=192.82s)]
*  Can't be understated they they haven't had a shooter like that which part which part that he's bounced around the league [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=197.06s)]
*  Well, I mean it's just a situation [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=203.18s)]
*  This could be the the best possible situation and Steven Adams returning to health means that triple J gets to go back to the position [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=205.18s)]
*  That he should play which power forward. He's not comfortable playing center, which is why he only averages five [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=212.14000000000001s)]
*  They were in the third string center last year, you know, I mean I like Memphis. They also kick ass at home [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=217.18s)]
*  You cannot understate how competitive they are in their own building and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=223.02s)]
*  You know, I think they lost five games last year at home [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=229.1s)]
*  Starting lineup is smart and Bain [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=232.94s)]
*  Looks like Zaire Williams [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=235.82s)]
*  Triple J and Steven Adams off the bench [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=238.02s)]
*  Canard unless he starts [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=242.3s)]
*  David Roddy can't say I was impressed by him last year the body [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=244.82s)]
*  Lofton [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=249.06s)]
*  Tillman [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=250.14s)]
*  Santi Aldama [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=251.38s)]
*  Contrar Derek Rose. I don't know complains a lot, but he's a legit rotation guy. I just don't order by the way [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=252.82s)]
*  I don't like the depth [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=259.02s)]
*  Compared to where they had a couple years ago. I don't I don't now [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=261.06s)]
*  This is where verna is gonna come in like now. Jesus Christ Simmons [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=265.02s)]
*  We win 50 games every fucking year [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=269.62s)]
*  What the fuck B minus he doesn't really he doesn't f-bomb that often [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=273.54s)]
*  The only f-bombs when we're on the phone or whatever doesn't offer you voted for Marcus smart two years ago defense player the year [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=278.32s)]
*  Hey, you all say what you want, but John Contrar [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=286.32s)]
*  I [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  Just think the 25 if you told me John was playing the entire season [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=292.2s)]
*  I would go over but if you're telling me they're gonna go 46 and 36 when they're probably around a 50-win team [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=295.28s)]
*  Do I think job being gone for one-third of the season is worth? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=301.4s)]
*  Five less wins I do I think there's somewhere between 43 and 45 and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=305.52s)]
*  That's where I have them. I have a question for you Rosilla about the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=310.92s)]
*  Would you bet if I gave you minus 130 smart revenge comeback year [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=315.6s)]
*  Plus 115 people realizing in December the Celtics probably sold high on them. Where would you put your money? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=321.48s)]
*  We already know the answer to sell high [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=329.72s)]
*  I mean the funniest thing ever of all the stuff that we get blamed for is like oh now you don't like smart because you [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=332.0s)]
*  Get traded. It's like have you not listened to us [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  You just told on yourself. Yeah, like this is not been the Marcus smart fan pod [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=339.64000000000004s)]
*  No, and I love Marcus smart. I did not love him last year [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=345.56s)]
*  I thought he looked like a tight end that was in his last legs of being a starter two years ago is the best basketball [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=348.28000000000003s)]
*  He's ever played but he was not that good three years ago was I thought brutal [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=353.96000000000004s)]
*  And when they talk about the defense with him, he got lit up by I can't even count how many guards lit him up [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=358.72s)]
*  I started everybody get a boner because he would stand up against a powerful right and be like look at me [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=364.44000000000005s)]
*  So wasn't that good defensively last year now? Maybe he was physically beaten up. Maybe he'll be awesome this year [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=369.56s)]
*  Maybe he was climbing the mountain like Rocky Balboa to have a fuck you year. Very possible. I told verno [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=375.24s)]
*  I thought that was possible, but I also think the Celtics I [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=381.04s)]
*  Think feel like they sold high so we'll see I wonder with him [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=385.12s)]
*  You know there was something going on between him and Joe Maas there was all season from game one there was [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=389.16s)]
*  There was a leadership thing with him [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=395.36s)]
*  I think he they felt like he had a little bit of a hold over the team that maybe wasn't great and [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=397.36s)]
*  I think they wanted the young guys to be in Taylor Jenkins, you know out there I [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=403.84000000000003s)]
*  I [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=408.35999999999996s)]
*  Could see him being like it's Marcus time for a little here my ideas [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=409.56s)]
*  Yes, so that's me on the total and no Tyes Jones [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=413.67999999999995s)]
*  She's like, I don't know if I've had a favorite backup love ties. He was really important for them [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=416.84s)]
*  Right. He's I don't know that I've ever liked a guy that comes off the bench as much as him in recent memory [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=422.29999999999995s)]
*  I mean granted I didn't sound like I voted him six man or anything like that [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=426.44s)]
*  I don't think I did can we talk through the first 25 games of crunch time for them? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=429.03999999999996s)]
*  Where it's smart? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=433.79999999999995s)]
*  Steven Adams [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=436.04s)]
*  Who no, it's just what it is. It's a bad free throw she's been Bain after what number game going? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=437.56s)]
*  Hey, it's Desmond Bain just night after night being written and can our spot in the but over and over again [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=443.32s)]
*  It's gonna be like the Celtics where the ball is gonna find smart with a minute left [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=448.72s)]
*  And he's gonna decide whether they win or lose and I think that's 50-50. Maybe a little worse [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=451.96000000000004s)]
*  You might be pulling me back to the underside [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=457.14s)]
*  I just I just I know I'm gonna watch this and go. Oh, I can't believe I or it's gonna go the other way [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=459.44s)]
*  Oh my god, this seems really good [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=465.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm such an idiot because they were unhealthy on top of everything else ever going through that was a really [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=466.96000000000004s)]
*  Healthy all the time. I mean he's he's yeah, but they were down [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=472.6s)]
*  2000 NBA games even Zara who I didn't love yeah, like in the drafts and he only played like 30 games from last year [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=476.92s)]
*  So I think triple J's had some sort of injury. I think at least in three years, right? Yeah [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=482.8s)]
*  USA, huh? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=489.12s)]
*  It's a lot of Desmond Bain. It's a lot of Marcus smart [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=491.2s)]
*  Just quickly [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=494.12s)]
*  Where do you have jaw in the can you please get your shit together rankings? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=495.8s)]
*  Is he one I think he might be one for me, but you can make a strong case for Zion just ahead of Sandoval [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=501.76s)]
*  I put a little reality TV in there for me. Yeah, I think I'm rooting for jaw way more than Sandoval. How about Zion? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=511.8s)]
*  I [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=521.08s)]
*  Think I'm rooting for job more than Zion even though I like Zion more as the player because I think was Zion it's [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=522.52s)]
*  Like we can get a weird self [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=529.8s)]
*  Inflicted debate here or who's done the more egregious thing but like [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=531.92s)]
*  Some of the job stuff feels like a cry for help Zion is just like I don't give a fuck [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=536.72s)]
*  we have when the GM comes out during the summer and basically says [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=541.0799999999999s)]
*  Really proud of Zion. He's he's handing himself like a professional all summer [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=545.56s)]
*  It's like cool the guys this is his fifth gonna be his fifth NBA season. I'm I'm psyched that he's been a professional [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=550.24s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like it's a real problem as we'll get to and wait is like Zion's problems could be fixed with him [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=557.08s)]
*  Just deciding hey, I don't want to I don't want to go down this path [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=562.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? Yeah, I don't want to do the same as true of job [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=565.48s)]
*  Well, it's a it's a different conversation [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=570.6s)]
*  Yeah, where you could you can win the debate against me by saying well jaw clearly is [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=572.88s)]
*  The guy that you'd be less likely to root for because he's doing this other stuff [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=578.6s)]
*  Which again depends on there was I agree. So there's some cry for help stuff with John where it's like he he already knew he was [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=584.12s)]
*  Like Johnny yellow card. Yeah, John at least knew like hey stay in shape and [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=591.04s)]
*  And want to play basketball [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=597.12s)]
*  Okay, where I on you know the stuff I've heard from the three different [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=600.1999999999999s)]
*  You know for like they've tried everything with him they tried Alvin Gentry who was like I'm not gonna hold his hand [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=605.0400000000001s)]
*  He tried Stan who you know has forgotten more about hoops and most people have but that didn't work and then it's like all [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=610.88s)]
*  Right gonna been bringing Willie who I think is a terrific head coach and now you got Borrego's in there, too [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=617.2800000000001s)]
*  It's good babysitter [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=622.2800000000001s)]
*  well, like I [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=623.9200000000001s)]
*  Just don't want the 30 for 30 on Zion when he's 35 [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=626.1600000000001s)]
*  Well, we've certainly filmed the first 45 minutes of it [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=630.2800000000001s)]
*  Right. I'm I like for whatever I could be totally wrong [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=634.72s)]
*  But I've already convinced myself that like this was a lot of weird shit for job very quickly [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=637.96s)]
*  But then again sometimes when I look at the tweet bounce back from that. Yeah, but you know what? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=642.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna actually I'm gonna challenge my there's been a few tweets from job where I'm like, oh wait [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=646.96s)]
*  Maybe you don't get it. Yeah, like the stuff where it's like three times a week for the therapy [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=652.48s)]
*  yeah, the the Zion piece of [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=657.44s)]
*  they were talking I saw on Twitter there was a [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=660.84s)]
*  there was a jumping clip of him like in a layup line where he did a dunk and [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=663.74s)]
*  I saw it on Twitter or tick tock or my son said it somebody said to me [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=668.02s)]
*  It was like, oh Zion's been putting him work and he just did like a dunk and I'm like [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=671.26s)]
*  That's not even close to what he looked like a Duke like athletically. He's not there anymore. I don't think you're right [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=675.46s)]
*  I watched a dude. I am completely it's like a fucking one-of-a-one [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=681.6999999999999s)]
*  It's crazy how that happens. Like I was watching [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=687.34s)]
*  The Steph Harden game where Steph had 33 in the second half [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=690.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Durant had gotten hurt and even watching like those guys move around four years ago [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=694.86s)]
*  Mm-hmm. It can it can almost be alarming and watching the Duke Zion stuff. You're like, oh that guy's gone [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=700.18s)]
*  like he's gone forever happened to Blake Griffin in like [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=706.62s)]
*  2012 Quippers early Lob City Blake Griffin and then by the time we got to 16 after he had a couple surgeries [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=710.62s)]
*  He just wasn't the same explosive jumper anymore [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=716.38s)]
*  No, Rashid Wallace had a quote about this where like I forget somebody came in because Rashid used to just be violent at the rim [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=718.9399999999999s)]
*  but yeah beginning and he was huge, but he had massive pop and [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=726.22s)]
*  He had said something like you got you got those dunks for like four or five years, right? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=730.3s)]
*  And I don't care who you are. Like you're just not going to have that same [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=735.34s)]
*  Exploited I'm thinking like what he can't be saying that at 26 27, but for a lot of guys, he's kind of right and [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=739.5s)]
*  Unfortunately, we've been done. We've been denied the Zion. It's never coming back [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=745.74s)]
*  I don't think dude [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=750.74s)]
*  I he closed out on a guy in the corner and blocked a three-point shot [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=751.54s)]
*  That was like the greatest basketball highlight moment of your life until the 19 things Wembe is gonna do this year [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=754.9s)]
*  Yeah, I don't I don't know like look you just get bigger as you get older and all that kind of stuff [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=761.5799999999999s)]
*  But yeah, he's not in the air anymore. All right, we got to keep going. So we're going to I'm under you guys are both over [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=766.14s)]
*  Memphis surprising, okay Dallas [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=772.18s)]
*  We could spend one minute on this or we can spend 30 the over under is forty three and a half [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=775.7199999999999s)]
*  There plus one eighty five for a division, which is an interesting short of Memphis [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=781.4599999999999s)]
*  If you want to get excited, there's somehow 25 to win the title. I'm happy to book those bets [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=785.6999999999999s)]
*  minus 192 for the playoffs I [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=791.38s)]
*  Don't know where to start where should we start with so look okay. Well, I [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=796.62s)]
*  Mean if you want to trump it all with they have Kyrie is their number two guy. Good luck with the over [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=801.58s)]
*  It's a hard argument to counter but you know forty three and a half [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=806.94s)]
*  I think it's the lowest you're gonna get with Luca at the stage of his career [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=812.0200000000001s)]
*  I think Luca finally is gonna be a little pissed off about everything [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=815.6600000000001s)]
*  You know feeling like he still was doing it the right way even though he needed to kind of step up his game [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=820.1s)]
*  He could make an excuse that his way was always working because they made to the Western Conference [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=824.86s)]
*  Conference finals two years ago, which was still sort of weird with the fact that they beat Phoenix, you know [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=828.9s)]
*  I'm still not quite over that one [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=833.66s)]
*  But at forty three and a half knowing they won 38 games last year still were sort of tanking at the very end to protect [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=835.94s)]
*  The pick and they won 15 two years ago and I think Josh Green is gonna be good [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=841.98s)]
*  I think Grant gives them something stable [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=847.66s)]
*  You know, they also brought it's a table like the sound of conversation [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=850.76s)]
*  Well, he's just not Christian Wood a voice talking they don't have the Christian Wood option anymore [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=855.74s)]
*  Cuz like once you have to get Christian Wood on your team to understand like oh wait [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=860.02s)]
*  Well, we've had five years of Luca [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=863.9s)]
*  How many guys have been like well, we got to get rid of that guy [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=866.46s)]
*  He doesn't fit here. Does anyone fit with Luca? Oh, it's definitely getting to like the dangerous [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=870.1800000000001s)]
*  I just feel we've been so hard on James Harden and it's just like who does fit with Luca [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=877.38s)]
*  No, it's there's said Curry kind of fits with them because we've seen it and they brought Seth Curry back [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=882.06s)]
*  So I was excited for that. I love seeing the hope for Dante Exum that like he's been so nasty [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=886.9s)]
*  Shout out to Danny Chow. He's Danny. He's on XM Island by himself. It's [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=891.98s)]
*  Give me the over which you know, I wouldn't want to do with Kyrie [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=896.9s)]
*  But I just think it's a low number for what a great do Luca year gives you wanna [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=899.86s)]
*  Can you put that in pencil until I'm done with my Dallas part because I might bring you back. Okay [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=903.9599999999999s)]
*  What do you have house I also prefer the over okay because of how I the esteem that I keep on Luca, okay [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=909.54s)]
*  Kyrie has not had a normal NBA season since 2017 [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=920.22s)]
*  What we're doing in 2017 Marcello, what are we doing like around April 2017 we would have been held at that point [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=926.86s)]
*  Have your own show no [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=933.78s)]
*  I think canal just got laid off and I was in Manhattan Beach looking for a house and they were like you're not being laid [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=935.46s)]
*  Off. Can you please come back? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=941.26s)]
*  Okay, it was actually exactly how about you house what was going on in 2017 for you? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=943.66s)]
*  I feel like I was trying to in April [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=948.4200000000001s)]
*  I probably was trying to figure out who could pay for me to go to the Masters that seems like what I would that's every year [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=950.34s)]
*  Yeah [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=956.54s)]
*  All right 2017 for us. I think was like year two of the ringer [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=957.98s)]
*  I just he's played 290 games in the last six years. Is that low? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=963.3000000000001s)]
*  yeah, he's played 22 playoff games since the [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=968.26s)]
*  2017 finals and [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=971.7s)]
*  every year he figures out a reason to be [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=973.54s)]
*  unhappy about something or to go sideways on something and I [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=977.1800000000001s)]
*  Just can't get out of my head that he's gonna try to force himself to the Lakers in January February [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=981.38s)]
*  They they have all these assets that are ready. They're ready to trade [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=986.62s)]
*  They did that Russell contract specifically to trade it and if anything about the situation is unhappy and he thinks he has another place to go [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=990.54s)]
*  We've seen what he does and I just don't trust it [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=998.46s)]
*  And I don't really think even necessarily wanted to resign with Dallas [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1002.3s)]
*  I just think he did now he's probably gonna somebody will cut this clip and put it on his Twitter timeline and then hope [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1006.3s)]
*  Tweet at it with like some weird emoji. That's pretty cool though [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1012.34s)]
*  I'm just saying this is a six-year track record of when was the last time you had a normal NBA season [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1015.48s)]
*  Six years. This is would be your seven [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1021.04s)]
*  So I'm I'm going under I just don't trust them if you're if you're the second best player on the team your name's Kyrie and [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1024.68s)]
*  I don't really love the rest of the team. They're relying on two rookies [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1033.0s)]
*  Like lively is gonna play like the Duke fans weren't even happy about lively. This was a year ago. It was in college [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1038.2s)]
*  Prosper they're gonna need to play Josh Green who had some moments [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1044.36s)]
*  But was buried by the end of last year and then grant was getting DMPs on Boston. So on paper [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1047.6s)]
*  I get it's like oh I got this but I don't really trust any of those guys [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1053.2s)]
*  I don't trust Jaden Hardy Seth is probably the most reliable third guy in the team. I like Grant [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1057.1599999999999s)]
*  I like Josh Green way more than Jaden Hardie [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1062.32s)]
*  But they buried him last remember they Josh Green like fell out of the rotation by the end of the year [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1065.3999999999999s)]
*  I like Josh Green too [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1069.6399999999999s)]
*  Powell how many bat bats can he get I like him as a backup in this pop to lively being the starter. It's crazy [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1071.88s)]
*  God everybody likes lively more after he left Duke [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1080.0400000000002s)]
*  I feel like that's like one of those NFL college football [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1083.4s)]
*  Disconnects where one group can't believe the way the other group is talking about a player and in this case like I didn't love [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1086.0400000000002s)]
*  Lively's draft stuff at all. Like there's times you didn't even know he was right next to the rim, right? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1092.96s)]
*  There's it's one clip. I have a rookie centers. I'm sorry good [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1096.6000000000001s)]
*  No, I don't look I just feel like Luca coming in a little pissed off knowing how disappointing last year was like [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1099.6s)]
*  Luca is good enough to get you to 45 wins [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1106.1799999999998s)]
*  So that's my view as well and and to your point everything that you laid out about Kyrie [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1108.3999999999999s)]
*  Misbehaving this upcoming season could be true and they can still win games. It's better for him to play well and [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1114.52s)]
*  Try and force what he won. I just think that's been I think top three most dysfunctional NBA organization for the last 10 years [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1121.3999999999999s)]
*  like not the last five for the last 10 they've had the most weird shit and just [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1129.6799999999998s)]
*  hard stuff to figure out the most kind of zags and trades and they lucked into the Luca trade, but I [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1134.72s)]
*  Just don't see any cohesiveness with anything about them and I don't trust Kyrie [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1140.72s)]
*  so if I'm wrong on this so be it but um, I'm I just couldn't risk kicking myself and that god damn it I got sucked in [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1145.08s)]
*  It's just a low bar 44 wins, but here's the thing. I'm with you normally on Lucas. So good [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1152.96s)]
*  It's a guaranteed 45 wins, but the league is awesome. There's so many great players now [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1159.16s)]
*  I don't know if you can just write that to me. It's Yoko Janis [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1163.52s)]
*  They're the only two now that you can say that's 50 wins plan. We've seen curry missed the playoffs [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1167.1200000000001s)]
*  So Luca missed the playoffs last year [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1171.8000000000002s)]
*  So I'm out. All right, so [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1174.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm under you guys are both over. We've had some good disagreements this year [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1176.76s)]
*  When are we on the clock with Luca for you Rossello, what if they start out 24 and 26? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1181.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, look I think the hardened thing that you brought up is interesting because it was kind of like in the beginning you're like [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1186.8s)]
*  Oh my god, it's amazing [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1192.1999999999998s)]
*  You know look at the numbers and those two series that he had against the Clippers are like all-time things [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1193.1999999999998s)]
*  You don't have to look at the numbers [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1197.86s)]
*  He's just watching the games be like this guy is like on another level the battle he was having with Kawhi there [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1199.04s)]
*  But when somebody needs the ball this much you do wonder like I always wonder with the high usage rate [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1204.04s)]
*  Guy at the top and it's worked for other teams. Yeah, but a lot of times you're like, okay [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1210.6399999999999s)]
*  The best option is him having the ball making the decision every single possession [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1216.24s)]
*  but is that actually the best option once you get into the playoffs and [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1220.02s)]
*  It really comes down to like what that person wants [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1223.08s)]
*  Where you know, it's just not my favorite despite how impressive he can be and how great the numbers are [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1226.28s)]
*  So I don't see a lot of evidence of those two being able to play together either and not so defensively [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1231.6999999999998s)]
*  There's a lot of questions. You didn't like the five and eleven that didn't grab your attention. I [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1236.32s)]
*  Like when Kyrie tells the other guy how smart he is [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1242.08s)]
*  When he's like, hey, if you were smarter, you would have understood that I was doing this [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1246.08s)]
*  It's time the hardest of the 30 teams the New Orleans Pelicans [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1250.6799999999998s)]
*  There's a giant ceiling for this team there's a massive floor with this team the over under is forty four and a half [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1256.24s)]
*  plus 210 for this division if you think they can [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1263.72s)]
*  Beat Memphis and Dallas forty two to one for the title. They're minus 132 for the playoffs, which to me is [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1266.8799999999999s)]
*  Stunning to me that they have minus odds for the playoffs [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1273.36s)]
*  They've already had some injury stuff Trey Murphy had a meniscus thing [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1277.0s)]
*  He's out for at least the first two months of the season and we've seen with meniscus is there always take a little bit longer [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1280.84s)]
*  Than people say Nance has some stuff going on [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1285.6399999999999s)]
*  Alvarado's had some stuff going on and that was basically [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1289.56s)]
*  You know their depth nausea [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1292.72s)]
*  Ingram's coming off a really really really weird team USA experience where they basically scratched them for the last two games and the deal [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1295.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he's got a virus [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1302.6399999999999s)]
*  We haven't seen Ingram and Zion play enough together to even really know what that is [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1306.12s)]
*  It's a team where I like a lot of the assets [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1312.56s)]
*  But it's like remember that show the offer I [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1316.3999999999999s)]
*  Was like I like a lot of the people on the show and I really like the Godfather [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1319.56s)]
*  But the show is not totally working for me. That's the pelicans to me [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1323.04s)]
*  That guy was so good as Robert Evans he was great Matthew good. Yeah, Matthew good. He's killing it [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1328.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I ended up reading the biography after that show I want to know more about him [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1333.76s)]
*  I was like, how can anybody become that interesting house? Anyway, give me the over fuck it [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1337.6s)]
*  Wow [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1342.48s)]
*  The thing is I knew that was gonna happen. Yeah, it's great. We're due [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1344.52s)]
*  We're due. We're due. We're due for one season of Zion. I believe in it [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1348.76s)]
*  Yeah, he is that this is the broke back the [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1354.1200000000001s)]
*  I [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1357.6599999999999s)]
*  Can't quit you Zion. I can't quit. You just can't quit him when he was point forward for that 25 games [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1358.94s)]
*  It was the most exhilarated I've ever seen [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1364.1399999999999s)]
*  Priscilla by freshman I was losing my mind cuz like he didn't even know what he was doing and I would see him learning [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1366.18s)]
*  Like oh, this is what they're doing to me defensively and then he'd figure this out and he's a good passer on these drives [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1371.18s)]
*  I was like, okay, I'm in because yes at one point last year [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1375.98s)]
*  I thought this was the most talented one through nine one through ten in the entire NBA [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1379.68s)]
*  And if you're giving me just any chance of good luck, right because we haven't had a lot of it down there [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1383.3799999999999s)]
*  Give me the chance of good luck over 44 and a half. I'm gonna lock it in. Oh [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1389.74s)]
*  Okay, I know we're not doing that yet. We're not doing that yet. But okay, what do you have? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1395.94s)]
*  That's the only one um, you know this about me [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1400.18s)]
*  I am nothing if not a petty gambler which is to say if I invest in you [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1402.54s)]
*  Yeah, go super hard and you start to they had the top record in the West [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1407.62s)]
*  this is the Italian in house it really is and [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1413.58s)]
*  The whole thing completely collapses falls apart and I lose all that money. I'm sorry. Fuck those motherfuckers [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1417.2199999999998s)]
*  under [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1425.58s)]
*  Under it's not I'm not you know [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1426.78s)]
*  It's it's there's too much bullshit going on all the time [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1429.54s)]
*  You went through just a small bit of the injury stuff [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1433.54s)]
*  But I'm not gambling on Brandon Ingram and Zion not doing it. So [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1437.3s)]
*  FTM [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1443.54s)]
*  So their last six seasons was 33 wins 30 31 36 42 [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1445.3400000000001s)]
*  last five seasons [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1451.78s)]
*  New Orleans has had two playoff series wins in 20 years [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1454.02s)]
*  They've had one low 150 win season they've won two lotteries [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1457.1799999999998s)]
*  They have more lottery wins than 50 win seasons and then if you tie in the history of the New Orleans Jazz [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1460.98s)]
*  It's just something about [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1467.4199999999998s)]
*  Basketball in this city has not worked and even when it seems like it should be working like last year [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1469.9399999999998s)]
*  It's this 20-game window and we're going holy shit. Are they gonna be the one seed? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1476.1s)]
*  I remember we might have even done a podcast right around then Rossello [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1481.46s)]
*  They were 23 and 12 [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1484.98s)]
*  Yeah, we were like man look at all these teams jug of like that one seed race the first few months of the season [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1486.98s)]
*  The Lakers were dead. And we love them at this time last year. We went through the whole thing [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1492.5800000000002s)]
*  We threw so many flowers at their feet [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1497.14s)]
*  I think I had Zion traded two years ago [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1499.14s)]
*  Well, here's the big question and this determines you over under [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1501.14s)]
*  If it's just an in or out, are you in on Zion or out on Zion at this point? Out [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1504.98s)]
*  I think I'm out too, but you're still in you can't quit him [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1509.94s)]
*  I'm just thinking like one year. He has to be healthy. So that's my play. There's not a lot of science behind it [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1512.5s)]
*  Why yeah, why does that have to be I would I would because I like the rest of the roster that much and I knew [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1518.34s)]
*  I think we did this two years ago because the last year we did the preview we were here two years ago [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1525.5s)]
*  We did it at your house. Yeah, so that was like the very first and I've been wrong with these in the past, but like [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1530.46s)]
*  Bringing up the idea of flirting and bringing the sales people in [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1536.9s)]
*  Bringing up the idea of flirting and bringing the salespeople down and bringing your marketing team in and going [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1539.7s)]
*  Look, let's let's get something for him that salvages because we've tried everything with it and it doesn't work [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1544.78s)]
*  And there's always something weird about like the college football coach who wins at a major program [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1551.74s)]
*  That guarantees you like two more good jobs [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1558.5s)]
*  Yeah [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1561.22s)]
*  or like the guy that dates somebody really hot at a restaurant and [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1561.74s)]
*  Then he gets dumped and then like there's somebody else who sort of attractive is like well, I guess I'll give him a shot [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1565.06s)]
*  Yeah, so like you want to be rewarded on the first transaction here [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1569.94s)]
*  And I still think there's a Zion price that would make it enticing but you'd have to get everybody on board because he's he's still their star [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1573.98s)]
*  They have all their firsts. They have their choice between [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1581.38s)]
*  24 or 25 Lakers first they can do pick swaps with Milwaukee and 24 and 26 and they have the Bucs [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1585.26s)]
*  27 first [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1593.06s)]
*  So if they're in the mix that the thing that scares me about going under with them is if they're in the mix at all [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1594.5s)]
*  And guys start becoming available and teams become disappointed or whatever like they could move fast. I [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1599.38s)]
*  Just don't trust it and I would rather [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1604.86s)]
*  Bet on the past history versus the the hope that Zion can turn it around [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1607.78s)]
*  But I see the thing is I think if everybody else is right they could still win 45 games. Yeah, I [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1612.06s)]
*  I see them right around that 44 point 5 like I get to them winning 45 44 43 [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1617.98s)]
*  It's gonna be somewhere in there ahead or here under everybody's upset about the team [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1623.9s)]
*  You know, but think how good he was towards the end last year [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1628.1000000000001s)]
*  But is he one of those guys that he's good when he has the ball all the time [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1630.7s)]
*  But the moment he's got to fit in with a bigger I was alarmed by how much he didn't fit in with Team USA [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1633.18s)]
*  Like alarm, maybe he thought it was a scrimmage. Yeah [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1639.8600000000001s)]
*  next one Houston [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1642.98s)]
*  So we have Houston in San Antonio left [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1644.8200000000002s)]
*  We can go a little bit fast on this but Houston's tough because they're over under 31 and a half [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1647.22s)]
*  Their plus 980 to make the playoffs. They were 22 and 60 last year. They had Fred van Vliet [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1652.78s)]
*  They had Dylan Brooks [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1658.94s)]
*  They had Thompson who everybody likes they somehow had came went more but it doesn't seem like he's gonna play that much this year [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1661.14s)]
*  they had Rosso's [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1668.58s)]
*  favorite favorite guy Jeff Green and [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1670.5s)]
*  Shangoon is now 6 foot 11, which nobody has investigated. I'm so trying to figure out what happened that a [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1673.6200000000001s)]
*  Lot of assets house are there enough basketballs for this team? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1678.82s)]
*  The only one that matters is in the hands of their head coach and [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1684.4599999999998s)]
*  Your my guy forecast for the season is is a forecast of what kind of impact can he may have [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1689.86s)]
*  He got two of his guys [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1697.08s)]
*  he clearly [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1699.02s)]
*  influenced the acquisition of [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1700.9399999999998s)]
*  VV and [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1703.02s)]
*  Dylan Brooks he had a say in it over he made it have James Harden word squashed that James Harden shit word [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1704.3s)]
*  He sure did nobody believed me on that. I was saying that for months [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1710.1200000000001s)]
*  He squashed that then he tried to kind of bring it take it back a little bit [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1713.14s)]
*  He was like, no, it was just like we love him, but it was an organization [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1716.74s)]
*  Like now you squashed it. So we're talking about a 10 win improvement over last season seems like a lot [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1720.54s)]
*  but [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1725.8600000000001s)]
*  The you know, there's been some [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1726.98s)]
*  It's a it's an entirely different character of team [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1729.14s)]
*  But it might be and it might be a year take a year to [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1733.14s)]
*  Get to the type we watched you may up close for a year there and that dude is like he holds everyone super [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1737.14s)]
*  Accountable doesn't put up with bullshit. He hates bad shots. You have to play defense [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1743.14s)]
*  He doesn't want any whining bitching all that stuff [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1748.02s)]
*  He will yank your ass from the court if you do one thing [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1750.42s)]
*  He doesn't like and there's a bunch of guys on this team that [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1753.9s)]
*  Are gonna get yanked off the court and it didn't work for the first, you know, the Celtics were fine [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1757.06s)]
*  I run after 500. What were they until they went on the run? They were under it was under [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1762.1s)]
*  Yeah, they were like under 25. It's one of my favorite things about emails the guy people come back to the bench [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1765.78s)]
*  He's like, what the fuck are you doing? And I can't wait to see him do it to this team [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1771.06s)]
*  I mean granted last year's team would have had a much harder time with this when you think about Jalen Green and then [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1776.34s)]
*  Kevin Porter, Jr. So [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1782.26s)]
*  I don't think Van Vliet and Dillon Brooks add 10 wins to your team. This is an email bet [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1784.26s)]
*  That that's the argument for me. It's too many wins because I think I think [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1789.86s)]
*  My fear with this team is [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1796.74s)]
*  They'll head to the place that they're gonna get to but I think the first 40 games are gonna be tough [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1799.22s)]
*  And there's also like multiple teams [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1803.54s)]
*  On this team because there's a couple versions of five guys [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1807.22s)]
*  Because there's a couple versions of five guys that I like [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1811.38s)]
*  There's a talent. Yeah, there's level here where you go. Okay, Jaylen. We still have hope for Jabari [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1815.38s)]
*  I like more towards the end of the year when he was initiating more of his own stuff [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1821.7s)]
*  But yeah [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1825.74s)]
*  like you could just tell what Jabari like it kind of sucked for him because he's got this backcourt that thinks they have [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1826.3s)]
*  To have the ball in their hands every single time and look Zach Lowe even did this thing on on Jaylen Green [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1831.02s)]
*  Yeah, but it felt a bit like the message of can you please be this guy? [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1836.5800000000002s)]
*  That Zach Lowe is hitting at in some of these because there's some numbers that are really good that are baked in there [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1842.02s)]
*  And then there's some horrifying ones or it's like after pick and roll [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1846.6200000000001s)]
*  This is the number of times that it led to an assist there because you can just see he [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1849.46s)]
*  It's it was a take turns team [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1853.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and it feels like with Van Vliet because he's so good on and off the ball that they were like [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1856.26s)]
*  Hey, this will sort of force our guys. Yeah, but this isn't about Jaylen Green's can score 30 again [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1861.0800000000002s)]
*  If he wants to I mean they can let but that's not what this is [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1866.38s)]
*  It's about him figuring out a play with some other really talented guys because there's like five or six young dudes on this team [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1869.6200000000001s)]
*  That I actually like but you need this kind of I love their draft. I thought I love Whitmore [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1875.3000000000002s)]
*  I think he could be easy. What's your favorite asset on this team has? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1880.5400000000002s)]
*  It's Jabari for me. It's a bar for me as well because of the growth that he showed us at the end of last season I [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1885.3000000000002s)]
*  Might have shangoon second. Yeah, I would back that he grew was like [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1891.42s)]
*  Astounding to me. He's like probably like a giant guy now the most fun [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1896.7800000000002s)]
*  I mean look Jaylen Green has some possessions where you're like, you know, it's funny cuz I think I'd have him third [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1900.3400000000001s)]
*  I was I think I was back home and they were playing Boston. Yeah, and I was like, yeah [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1904.9s)]
*  I know he puts up some numbers, but he's like a little shit and Jaylen Green looked like [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1910.1200000000001s)]
*  Fucking Jordan in his second year. I mean he was absurd [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1913.94s)]
*  So I hope it works out for him [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1917.3400000000001s)]
*  But I mean that's kind of the thing like if you're a Rockets fan [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1920.44s)]
*  You need to see some kind of it's not just a numbers thing with him because a lot of guys just have bigger numbers [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1923.34s)]
*  Well, don't you feel like it like we kind of have to know after this season in some way. Yeah with him [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1928.52s)]
*  It's your three. Yeah, this is a team that's gonna it's a little more professional [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1934.26s)]
*  Jabari definitely took a step up [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1939.56s)]
*  You could see it in summer Lake because then the team if it doesn't change your genuine green [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1941.62s)]
*  Then you know, the team is like hey [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1945.1s)]
*  I think we're gonna kind of like pivot how we initiate some of our offense stuff and then you're like wait [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1946.26s)]
*  So I'm not the chosen one anymore [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1951.24s)]
*  Is there anything funnier than veteran leader Dylan Brooks? [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1953.84s)]
*  Other than well the China jokes are just you know [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1958.08s)]
*  Apparently like people wanted him [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1961.96s)]
*  Do you go under house? Oh [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1964.04s)]
*  I hate it [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1967.32s)]
*  Because 31 is under so I'm gonna do under okay. I really want to do easy under for me [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1969.52s)]
*  I really wanted to do over [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1975.28s)]
*  It's the West is too good 32 wins is a lot it is too good you you know [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1977.92s)]
*  But we talked about a bunch of teams with good coaches and this team has a really good coach [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1982.74s)]
*  Yeah, and there's some teams we've talked about so far where it's gonna be right [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1986.6s)]
*  I'm telling you it's gonna be rocky for not gonna be psyched about it. Yeah, he is gonna be really hard in the okay [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1989.32s)]
*  Okay, this is gonna be the movie where the substitute superintendent comes in and is just super mean everyone in the school for the first half [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=1994.42s)]
*  of the first practice snowball [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2001.3s)]
*  I [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2003.7s)]
*  Was like [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2006.58s)]
*  The last team San Antonio [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2008.6599999999999s)]
*  This is an aside. I went to one travel team and my dad was like, what did you guys do? [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2010.86s)]
*  He's like, oh, we didn't they didn't let us use a ball [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2015.34s)]
*  He's like you're not on this team anymore right? He yanked you. He always thought that was like, yeah [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2017.86s)]
*  That's the worst thing just cuz first practice just be what scrimmage I want to see how yeah, right [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2022.5s)]
*  That'll be the best way to tell who sucks and who doesn't it's always a good [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2027.04s)]
*  Like in the corner for an hour San Antonio 28 and a half last year 22 and 60 [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2030.26s)]
*  They added a guy by the name of Victor women Yama do it [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2039.94s)]
*  Well, so [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2047.22s)]
*  For them to hit this over isn't you're not gonna are you for them to hit this over? He's got to play 70 games [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2048.58s)]
*  Right [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2057.42s)]
*  The all-time we don't have to do anything team I don't see how I play 70 games [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2058.74s)]
*  That's the problem [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2065.2999999999997s)]
*  if you gave me 70 games of him I [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2066.7s)]
*  Could talk myself into like 29 and 41 in those 70 games because he's so good [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2070.54s)]
*  But I just don't think I don't think they see the season this way. I think that's why they didn't go after Austin Reeves [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2075.3999999999996s)]
*  I think that's why they did some will take your bad contract trades [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2081.14s)]
*  And I think this was a throwaway season for them even though everyone says the drafts not that good this next draft right Rossella [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2085.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, these next two are supposedly I mean, you know, there's there's a couple ignite guys. There's a guy from Perth [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2091.48s)]
*  You know, there's not [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2099.7400000000002s)]
*  But you know this shit changes really quick [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2101.46s)]
*  Like I always think it's funny when front offices are like, oh the draft in 19 months sucks [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2103.6600000000003s)]
*  It's like we're all gonna be in Chicago and you're gonna be telling me how great it is one through six [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2107.98s)]
*  There's always somebody that pops up [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2112.42s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's 18 year olds to like hey, guess what some get better one of the things I don't like about this over under [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2114.54s)]
*  is you have to hit 29 I [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2120.58s)]
*  Can't see any scenario where they win like 35. So now you're giving me this like five win windowhouse [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2124.38s)]
*  But then you give me all the upside of under the 28 and a half where if they you know [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2130.46s)]
*  Wimby gets hurt for two weeks and they all of a sudden they go on a losing streak or they just yank them or they [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2135.84s)]
*  Rest them whatever they have to do [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2140.62s)]
*  It's a regretful under to me, but I did stare at it for a while especially because Vasell didn't really play last year [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2143.2599999999998s)]
*  I think he played 30 35 games. So getting him for a full year with Wimby. I [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2148.5s)]
*  Don't know. It seems like you you're not I it's an easy under for me. This is I think they're gonna makes you sad though [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2153.94s)]
*  I feel sadness. No, no, they're building not there [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2160.22s)]
*  Like if you look at the talent of San Antonio and put it side by side to Houston Houston was a much bigger challenge for me [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2162.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think that Houston situation. I hate going under on Houston [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2168.5s)]
*  San Antonio's building and it doesn't make sense for them to rush this kid and they're not gonna they're smart [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2173.2999999999997s)]
*  They'll take their time. They'll get the right players. They'll learn about you know [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2178.3399999999997s)]
*  What kind of NBA player he's going to be and how to use is around that? Yeah. Yeah, so they're they're not in a hurry [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2183.02s)]
*  He's gonna be the most viral NBA player. We've had since we've had this whole infrastructure [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2189.14s)]
*  I think that's the only thing that's guaranteed [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2193.3399999999997s)]
*  We thought it might happen with Zion and Zion had some injuries and some stuff and it didn't happen with him [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2194.8599999999997s)]
*  But just from the little stuff we've seen in the preseason there's never been anything like this [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2199.08s)]
*  He's my son is the most excited about him as he's been about any basketball player [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2203.92s)]
*  Since he got on social media and I just think he's gonna be a thing over and over again a really fun wrinkle [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2210.32s)]
*  It's one of those if he's on TV, I'm probably gonna watch I'm psyched off fourth quarter and it's kind of close [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2217.68s)]
*  I want to see what happens here [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2221.8s)]
*  So you're under Rossello. I am they're just not very deep either [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2223.64s)]
*  Like this isn't despite some of the picks some of the later picks I haven't loved and I just don't see why they'd be playing [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2227.4s)]
*  Him, you know, I just am always gonna be scared of the big guys that don't move like big guys [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2235.1200000000003s)]
*  And that's the beauty of him as a player [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2239.84s)]
*  But I mean, I think it'd be weirder if he didn't get hurt one of his first three or four years [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2242.52s)]
*  Yeah, there's danger potential with him [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2248.28s)]
*  Knock on wood, but it is under [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2251.48s)]
*  You [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5BQ6ysI8&t=2256.8s)]
