# Is Paul Pierce Underrated by the Younger Generation? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [September 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI)
*  What surprised me about Jimmy, the reason I was so surprised by it is because as [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=0.0s)]
*  great as a player, Jimmy is he like, you don't think of him as like a great [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  score, I know he's Jimmy buckets and all these things, but like you compare him [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=6.26s)]
*  to like a Paul George, a polished, a very, very polished score, but Jimmy was [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=10.46s)]
*  just getting it done. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=14.98s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=16.56s)]
*  I don't even know how to explain it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=16.84s)]
*  It's sometimes wasn't the prettiest 30 or 40, but like he just bullies guys. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=17.92s)]
*  He just does. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=21.76s)]
*  I, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=22.48s)]
*  and he was like that who I didn't think gets enough credit for it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=23.64s)]
*  Pierce was like that for a long time where he could, he could not have a great [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=26.68s)]
*  game, but he could catch fire for a quarter or he could catch fire for eight [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  minutes and he would just get shots. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=35.56s)]
*  He would hit all of a sudden the threes that weren't going in. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=37.68s)]
*  They started going in. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=39.8s)]
*  He could bully people like around 12, 10 feet away. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=40.72s)]
*  And he was always, I always thought like with the Wade Pierce debate, when [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=43.92s)]
*  people are like Paul Pierce is crazy. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=47.56s)]
*  He's not anywhere near Dwayne. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=49.16s)]
*  When it's like, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=50.64s)]
*  that's awesome. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=52.04s)]
*  I say this all the time because that thing has like become like an actual [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=54.08s)]
*  like meme now where like people like, like disrespecting Paul, just cause like [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=57.84s)]
*  he thinks of himself at Dwayne's class. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=61.0s)]
*  When people don't realize he was like right below that, like Paul Pierce was a [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=62.56s)]
*  stud and people forget how good and good to discuss footwork was and they don't [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=65.68s)]
*  have players like Paul no more, man. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=70.92s)]
*  There's the age of like six, nine big, heavy, small forwards who had their back [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=72.8s)]
*  to the basket shooting fadeaway twos, you know, stared out, played multiple [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=78.36s)]
*  positions, guard bigger guys, smaller guys. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=82.48s)]
*  They don't have that bro. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  Like now we're all tiny, skinny, lanky, athletic. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=86.4s)]
*  Like that's kind of more of the speed that we're going. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=89.44s)]
*  Like Paul would cut up in today's NBA, bro. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=91.72s)]
*  You don't like prime Paul Pearson in today's league. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=94.16s)]
*  My God, bro. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  Well, he would have shot way more threes too. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=97.84s)]
*  Cause I think like his third season. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=99.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=102.12s)]
*  We were shooting a lot of threes on the Celts, like almost like eight, nine a game. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=102.36s)]
*  And it was that early. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=106.64s)]
*  That Antoine. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=108.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=108.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=108.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=109.08000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=109.4s)]
*  They try to gain the system because they didn't have a ton of talents. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=109.84s)]
*  So like we're going to shoot a lot of threes. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=112.52s)]
*  People are like, Whoa, this is crazy. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=113.8s)]
*  And now that's kind of what the league's become, but I think he would have fit in. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=115.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=118.48s)]
*  He would have been fine. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=118.68s)]
*  He could shoot and Paul, they have this thing. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=119.48s)]
*  It's more like younger generation, which dominates social media a lot. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=121.4s)]
*  They like don't, they didn't see Paul and Paul's game also wasn't [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=124.36s)]
*  flashy and wasn't loud. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=127.76s)]
*  So like kids don't grow up. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=129.12s)]
*  You tubing Paul Pierce people YouTube D way people know about D way. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=130.76s)]
*  And he's so like still on social media and involved and we're like Paul [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=134.8s)]
*  Pierce is having drinks on like live streams and I was like two different, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  you know, two different things. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=142.16s)]
*  Like people don't really understand how good Paul is. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=143.64s)]
*  Like Paul, Paul was so nasty. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=148.2s)]
*  He was, he was really good, man. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  There's two issues. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=149.88s)]
*  One is that this internet NBA culture we have now has, has problems celebrating [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=150.72s)]
*  guys like him or like Ben Wallace, people like that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=155.6s)]
*  The other side, which I've always joked about is the internet because you can [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=158.72s)]
*  cut anyone into like a two minute clip. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=165.68s)]
*  All of a sudden it can be like Eddie Curry was a problem. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=165.84s)]
*  And you just show two minutes, Eddie Curry highlights, and then that's on [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=169.56s)]
*  Tik TOK and it goes, you can basically do that with any NBA player, but there's [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=172.56s)]
*  certain guards that seem like they were more like Steve Francis, Stefan Marbury, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=176.04000000000002s)]
*  those types of players that weren't necessarily winning players, but you could [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=180.76000000000002s)]
*  cut together awesome highlight packages of them. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  And I just, I really worry about this whole generation of people that basically [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=187.36s)]
*  think the league started when Kobe won his first two titles without Shaq or [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=192.51999999999998s)]
*  when LeBron went to the heat, you know, it's like, this is a long league that [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=197.11999999999998s)]
*  had a lot of great players and a lot of history to it, you know, I mean, your [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=201.67999999999998s)]
*  dad was in a million, a million awesome games and, and like people don't even [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=205.48s)]
*  remember Dominique at this point. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=210.64s)]
*  So I dunno, sometimes I feel like the old guy trying to protect the flame. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=212.2s)]
*  No, that's what, that's the problem is we start talking like this and people [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=215.92s)]
*  like, man, look at these dated motherfuckers just talking about, talking [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  like 31. Yeah. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=222.4s)]
*  And that's how I feel, but I go to the locker room and I talk to like these young [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=223.44s)]
*  players about like players that they should know. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=226.6s)]
*  Like we were talking last year in the locker room in Minnesota and we were [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=229.28s)]
*  talking about like best scores from Minnesota Tim Wolves, you know, I was like, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=232.51999999999998s)]
*  yo, Kevin Martin, y'all sleep on Kevin Martin could really score. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=237.32s)]
*  And guys, a lot of guys in the locker room were like, Kevin Martin, who's [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=240.32s)]
*  Kevin Martin? I was like, you don't know who fucking Kevin Martin is. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=242.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=245.12s)]
*  I was like, you know, you play for the Tim Wolves, you don't know who Kevin [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  Martin is. And I'm like Tom Gugliotta, like all these guys who feel like [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=247.64s)]
*  Torello Brandon, like I'm thinking of all these good like, and that, that era of [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=250.4s)]
*  the NBA is like a lot of that's lost with like this new generation. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=254.92000000000002s)]
*  They just like don't tap into it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=258.6s)]
*  And I guess I did because of my dad. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=260.8s)]
*  I, I, maybe, I don't know. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=262.92s)]
*  I just that yeah, it's gone. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=264.56s)]
*  Well, what you're laying out is the NBA's biggest fear, because it's not just [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=267.16s)]
*  people you're playing with. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=271.04s)]
*  It's the under 25 generation in general, whether they're actually watching games [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=272.04s)]
*  or whether they're just like my son who loves sports and plays sports, but doesn't [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  watch games and gets all this NBA knowledge through like TikTok and YouTube [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=281.12s)]
*  videos and slices of things and highlights and 2K and 2K ratings. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=285.8s)]
*  2K ratings are like incredibly important for my son. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  It's the worst thing ever, man, because they're made by a bunch of guys who were [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=293.72s)]
*  picked last in gym class and they're, they're, they're out here making ratings [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=296.8s)]
*  based off of stats when stats only dictate someone's situation. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=300.84000000000003s)]
*  So like you giving someone a 69 rating when he's in a terrible situation, it [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=305.2s)]
*  doesn't play, it's just the dumbest thing ever. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=308.56s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=310.2s)]
*  So it's like, that's why it's stupid to do that. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=310.6s)]
*  But kids, yeah, they like look at 2K. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=313.44s)]
*  Like I get this all the time. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=315.32s)]
*  I'll go to Chipotle and someone be like, yo man, they got to fix your rating. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=316.2s)]
*  I'm like, brother, I don't give a fuck what Ronnie 2K has me rated. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=319.76s)]
*  And shout out to Ronnie. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=323.56s)]
*  I love Ronnie, but no man, like that stuff's ridiculous. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=324.36s)]
*  I just, they don't. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=327.32s)]
*  Well, this speaks to the Duncan, the Duncan problem that we are now in where [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=330.15999999999997s)]
*  people are like, eh, Tim Duncan, he's fine. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=335.24s)]
*  But that seems to be a thing. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=338.03999999999996s)]
*  Like Duncan, I had Duncan over Kobe in my book. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=340.12s)]
*  I still have Duncan over Kobe now. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=344.4s)]
*  I think both of them are in the top 10 and two of the greatest [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=345.88s)]
*  persons I've ever had, but Duncan was a guaranteed 50 wins the entire time [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbkWa5YgIhI&t=348.56s)]
