# A Jokic Appreciation, The Worry Scale + More from DENVER w Ryen Russillo  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [December 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3mSojn0wJM)
*  W na geldi.
*  Red is so pretty,
*  not like the others.
*  Ho.
*  I should have worked out today.
*  I feel, I feel scrawny.
*  Thanks for coming out.
*  Thank you to State Farm because I always forget to thank them before we start this stuff.
*  But oh, and story.
*  Thank you to story.
*  Here's how this show happened.
*  I texted Brasillo and I said, Jokic is in playing Golden State in the NBA Cup game on
*  a Tuesday.
*  Live show?
*  And he was like, fuck yeah.
*  Why do you love Denver so much?
*  You know, I think it was, I had a bunch of friends, like there's a big Vermont, Colorado
*  thing.
*  There you go.
*  And I think once they were like, all right, I've kind of done the JV version of things
*  in Vermont.
*  I'm gonna head out to Colorado.
*  And when I left ESPN and I was kind of going like, all right, Manhattan Beach or Denver,
*  it was like really close.
*  Was it a toss up?
*  It was, it was ocean or friendship.
*  And then friendship lost out to the ocean.
*  I think that people in Denver, every time I'm here, they're disarmingly nice.
*  That's what I, that's what I notice over and over again.
*  I'm like, oh man, people are just nice here.
*  But then I wonder.
*  I think those are my friends by the way.
*  Then I wonder if it was just their stone.
*  Friendship, friendship.
*  So we're going to try to do a version of the pod that we would do on Sunday nights because
*  we haven't done Sunday nights this year because we should wait till when the NFL is over.
*  We have a lot of basketball stuff to talk about, but the real reason we're here, let's
*  be honest, Rossella and I both love Nicole Okich.
*  We're not going to hide it.
*  We love how the guy plays.
*  He's about as reliable as it gets from an entertainment standpoint, not just sports,
*  music, movies, TV.
*  I feel like succession got to this point for me, succession episodes.
*  I was like, I just know this is going to be a good episode.
*  We just love Yoakich and we wanted to surround ourselves with 1100 people who also loved
*  Yoakich.
*  Which is why this first segment is going to be called Yoakich porn.
*  We're just going to porn it up.
*  We don't have a slideshow for this.
*  Oh my God.
*  We were sitting behind the scores table yesterday and he came up and we were just kind of marveling
*  at him.
*  We're like, look at that guy.
*  Oh man.
*  Just amazing.
*  Where do you want to start?
*  Do you want to start with notes from last night?
*  Do you want to go big picture?
*  Where do you want to go?
*  The only thing I would say is that Bill and I have been doing this, whether it's together
*  or separately for a really long time, that I know personally, players that I start to
*  like or start to hate have a lot to do with how the fans talk to us.
*  So there's just players I know nothing about and I despise them just because of what their
*  fan base has said the entire time.
*  And Denver and Nuggets fans are seriously maybe the only modern history intensely annoying
*  fan base about one guy and you were totally right about it.
*  I think that needs to be said because more often than not, I'm like, nah, you were wrong.
*  You guys are just annoying about the whole thing.
*  And I don't think it was ever that we didn't, they just got to appreciate him, I think,
*  quicker than we did because you were watching it happen and whether it was the draft and
*  you're like, hey, that fat guy is kind of like fun to watch.
*  But what's he really going to be?
*  And then you're like, oh, he's going to be like without question.
*  The list starts at one and I don't even, like I love Giannis, we all love Luca and everything,
*  but the gap between him and the next guy right now, I think is significant.
*  This is great.
*  I'm already having a great time.
*  I think what's crazy about this year is he somehow got better.
*  I mean, he already won three MVP's in a title.
*  See, I told you we're going to porn it up with Jokic.
*  And I think the best friend of mine described it and I'm going to steal it from him where
*  Jokic was always playing chess when he was out there.
*  He was always like two, three moves ahead.
*  He was just so smart.
*  It was always so admirable to watch how he just processed the game.
*  But then Minnesota, Minnesota threw some stuff at him, right?
*  They were like, yeah, we're actually fine with you taking those threes.
*  We're going to beat you up.
*  We're just going to throw big guys at you.
*  We're going to try to wear you down.
*  And now this season, it feels like he's, he's moved into this speed chess mode where it's
*  not just chess.
*  He's now solving stuff instantaneously and watching him in person last night.
*  I mean, Golden State was like, you're not doing the thing you always do.
*  We're not giving you 14 assists tonight.
*  Right.
*  You're going to, we're going to take away everybody else and you're going to have to do the thing
*  you hate to do, which is score a lot.
*  And he's like, all right, fine.
*  Fuck.
*  And ends up with 38.
*  He's six for seven in the fourth quarter, makes all the big shots.
*  But I just feel like he's solving stuff faster.
*  Does that make sense?
*  Yeah.
*  Because I think he knows he needs to.
*  And I think that first week, like I both hated and loved it.
*  We all get geared up for the start of the season.
*  We all know we were worried about the bench.
*  Look at me.
*  I'm saying we, like I actually moved here.
*  But when you knew there were going to be some serious problems with the depth and letting
*  KCP go and the draft picks, you know, still kind of like a massive question mark about
*  whether or not they're viable rotation pieces.
*  And he took, I think 13 shots in that opener against OKC and it gets smoked.
*  The next two games, he takes 27 and 26 shots.
*  And I was so happy about it because it was like this immediate thing within 48 hours
*  where we went, I guess this is what I'm going to have to do.
*  I mean, he's not shooting it that much, but he's shooting it more now the season than
*  any other point in his career.
*  And yet his efficiency is in line with the best season he's ever had, which is probably
*  the one he had two years ago.
*  So he can unlock anything in every single game at that size in a way that I don't know
*  that we've ever seen before.
*  I hadn't seen him in Denver.
*  I've seen him obviously all over the place, but not here.
*  He did two things last night.
*  You know, you could pick up most of it on TV.
*  One of the things was he was just trying to read what Golden State was going to do from
*  what Kerr was telling his players.
*  So he would like run down and he'd be in the paint on the Golden State side, just watching
*  Kerr, what he was saying and what he was flashing.
*  And then he was yelling to his teammates, they're running five, three and Kerr would
*  be like, what the fuck?
*  You're cheating.
*  He was getting bad, but he was calling out all their plays, everything they're doing
*  with Curry, which is been a recurring theme.
*  So that was one.
*  The other one they're up to, there's like what 16 seconds left.
*  They're playing keep away and he gets the ball at the top of the key.
*  Normally when a guy gets it, they either throw it back out or they dribble out.
*  They're just trying to, they know they're going to get fouled.
*  And he was like, Oh, they're going to found me.
*  I'm actually going to lurch forward, drive into this guy and see if I can get a three
*  point play, which I don't think I'd ever seen anyone process it that fast.
*  So two little things, but we left.
*  We were just like beaming.
*  We didn't even know what to do.
*  We were like, that was amazing.
*  It was like the Chris Farley show with Paul Bacardi.
*  Remember when we saw Jokic?
*  That was awesome.
*  Yeah.
*  We, if he had been in town and would have declined the request because he would have,
*  um, if we would ever get the chance, like, I think I would be such a loser in that interview.
*  It could be like, remember when you did that thing, like what, what, what were you thinking
*  about when you did it?
*  And I think, honestly, I think like the hard part with it too.
*  And it's the same back to his drafting.
*  Like when the draft comes around, I'm an athlete snob and you go, I don't know.
*  Is this, is this going to work?
*  And then it starts working and then you start comparing them.
*  And we had all those nasty MVP conversations, which I just made me root for him.
*  I think even more because it just, well, it just was ridiculous.
*  Like some of the stuff, and I know it turns into propaganda and it becomes really political.
*  And it's like, okay, but if you're any of your points are tearing this guy down, like
*  you just, you're not, you're either not watching or you're not being fair or you're not being
*  honest or you can't see the things.
*  And I think it's such a visual thing with him that we've talked about in the past is
*  other basketball players have done things that are just aesthetically more pleasing.
*  I've seen him get back in transition where I thought he was going to have a heart attack.
*  I was like, does he have, does he have like polio?
*  Like what the fuck is wrong with him right now?
*  And, and yet he's always in position.
*  He knows everybody, everybody, what they're going to be doing ahead of time.
*  And you know, when I say no, when he's unlocked the game at his size, I mean, certainly
*  LeBron and I'm just giving his Yoko just got an inch on him or two and then magic the
*  same thing, but like to be straight up a center and then know, okay, well, if they're
*  doubling me, then it's all of these things.
*  If they're not doubling me, he's just sitting there in the triple thread at the free throw
*  line going up against TJD and he's just, he's just being like, all right, if you're
*  going to give me one on one and I'm just going to just jab step you and hit this free
*  throw.
*  Like I would like a night where he just did it 35 times, like score 60.
*  Right.
*  They won by four last night.
*  He played 40 minutes and was plus 23.
*  So try to figure that out.
*  That would have been a Stanton when he didn't play.
*  Well, those first three minutes of the fourth quarter, as you know, are the most
*  horrifying.
*  I just panicked.
*  Like there are horror movies that are more fun than those three minutes of every fourth
*  quarter where you're like, they, they were minus eight in those three minutes.
*  I'm like, gold state has to win this and they want it.
*  And then they still lose the game because he comes back.
*  One thing, sorry to get big picture on this, but one thing I was thinking with him,
*  there's still like mystery with him.
*  I don't know a lot about him and people are trying to figure out like NBA ratings are
*  going down a little bit.
*  What does this mean to people like the product as much?
*  Is it too easy to follow the sport without actually watching the games, game in and
*  game out.
*  But I do think a piece of it is there's no mystery with any of these guys.
*  They are, they're all on social media.
*  You know, they're, they're doing like the infomercial documentaries about themselves.
*  They're all over the place.
*  They're super available.
*  And I feel like I know all of them.
*  And when you think like, when we were growing up, we didn't know anything about
*  anybody we watched and Yoko is just like one of the last, I know he's got two
*  brothers.
*  I know, I know he likes horses.
*  I, I know he goes to Serbia as soon as the season ends and that's it.
*  Like, I don't even know, like what kind of car does he drive?
*  Nothing.
*  Right.
*  What do you know?
*  Do you know anything other than that?
*  Um, I know, I think it pisses everybody else off that this guy is this dominant
*  and there's not going to be a workout program that he's going to share with
*  right.
*  Like there's not going to be a mama mentality rip off of Yoko that it's like,
*  you know, I remember, I know Mike Singer wrote the book about him and I was
*  listening to an interview that he did.
*  So there were some excerpts and it was, he hated practice.
*  He didn't want to do any of these things.
*  So it's, it's like the opposite of everything that you would tell your kid.
*  Like this guy hated all of the extra stuff and yet he's this dominant, but it's,
*  it's about his instincts and his vision and just simple things like watching
*  people play basketball, like I have now for, for like 40 years.
*  And you watch the ball come out of his hands and like, even when it's off, it's
*  like, no, it's just soft.
*  It's perfectly soft and it like cuddles with the rim a little bit.
*  And then it falls back in.
*  It's his hands.
*  Like, I know that it was the water polo thing, but like, however he was taught to
*  look at the game, it's really special stuff because he just, he just sees it in a
*  way that you have to kind of be born with that.
*  I just don't, I don't even know if that can be taught.
*  See, I told you it was going to be Yokoch porn.
*  You guys didn't believe me.
*  You guys were like, ah, let's do five minutes.
*  Yeah.
*  It would be interesting.
*  Like if Yokoch started doing stuff that the other players do, how startling would
*  be where it's like, Yokoch just formed a production company.
*  Like what?
*  He wants to make independent movies.
*  He does?
*  Tell stories about underserved stories.
*  Or he just, he has an IT band thing on Instagram.
*  All of a sudden he's running the no days off.
*  And you're like, what?
*  Yokoch just bought a woman's soccer team.
*  He did big picture.
*  Well, it's 20 games.
*  We're not going to do the, he's going to win the MVP.
*  He's certainly on pace.
*  He's averaging 30 and 13 and 10.
*  He's shooting 56%.
*  He's shooting 52% from three, which is more than half in case you can't do math.
*  Um, and if he gets a fourth MVP here, now we're in the club with Jordan, LeBron,
*  Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Will Chamberlain.
*  And that's it.
*  Um, what's interesting, two things are in play now.
*  Well, one, he's kind of clinched the best guy of the 2020s.
*  Cause now we have some time still.
*  Well, we got, so we're halfway through the decade.
*  We're heading toward the second half.
*  I don't know who could make a run at him in the second half.
*  If you just look at the candidates, like the resume he already has, if he
*  won four MVPs, like who would be able to match that in the second half of the
*  decade, we're talking, this is a lot to ask for the Mellow Balls, my point.
*  Yeah.
*  He has some work to do, um, scoring a lot.
*  I think we'll get to him maybe later in the show, but yeah, you're
*  right.
*  I mean, that's kind of why it gets back to even, I've never rooted for the
*  nuggets necessarily.
*  Like I'm never, I don't have some thing that back in the day, I would've
*  probably started two years ago and tapped out after this off season, but, um,
*  that's coming up later too.
*  Uh, there could be somebody that gets, well, you're right.
*  We're halfway through it.
*  So who gets a second ring?
*  That would be the dumb ring count thing that gets in the way.
*  I think of just being honest about who players are sometimes.
*  So you're right.
*  You might have to be a guy that has to admit that is in their twenties.
*  That makes a huge leap over the next three years.
*  So like, I'm the, well, when B would he have enough time?
*  So you guys are going to laugh, but the only guy I think could, could be in the
*  running is my guy, Jason Tatum.
*  Yeah.
*  I said it.
*  Just, just hit the Celtics, won a bunch of titles.
*  That's it.
*  But I don't think that's going to happen.
*  All right.
*  Is Tatum a more athletic Yolkich?
*  There's no bad ideas in a brainstorm.
*  Come on.
*  Uh, yeah, but no, no one has ever looked Tatum.
*  I think is actually underrated at this point, but don't worry, don't worry,
*  don't worry.
*  Uh, he's never once and never will be considered the best player in the world.
*  Right.
*  That's why it's not going to happen.
*  It's not going to happen.
*  It's not going to happen.
*  Um, best center since Kareem is in play for him too.
*  But yeah, I was looking back at what else is in play.
*  You're good at.
*  Well, I think you update this stuff a lot.
*  I do.
*  But I like it.
*  You're keeping track.
*  It's one of my things when I'm bored on an airplane, when we haven't taken
*  off and I'm like, I think I'll work on the Pantheon.
*  How many times have you ranked the top 20 players of all time in your life?
*  Uh, I just did it four hours ago.
*  I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm
*  He sent me the text.
*  It's interesting.
*  I mean, doing best player by decade isn't totally fair because sometimes people
*  can peak starting in the middle of decade, whatever, but if you go back.
*  Like 2010s is LeBron and Curry and probably in that order, right?
*  It's LeBron.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I'm going to bring the ring count thing, but you know, even if
*  Curry was winning MVPs and I thought somebody, somebody at a sports bar
*  could make a Curry case, he wouldn't be right.
*  In 2000s, it's Duncan and Kobe.
*  And that's a bloodbath argument that we're not going to have right now.
*  Shouldn't be.
*  Yeah, I have Duncan, but other people would say Kobe.
*  Um, 1990s is MJ alone.
*  There's no other person in the combo.
*  Eighties is magic and bird.
*  Seventies is Kareem.
*  Is it magic?
*  And sixties is Russell.
*  Will
*  longer run those pistons finals.
*  Um, Kareem in the seventies, Russell and the sixties.
*  The point is Yoke edge doesn't even really have a rival for the 2020s yet,
*  which I think is interesting.
*  I guess it would be Janice if he could, I think Janice is the second best player.
*  You know, as much as I'm like in love with the Yoke edge part of it, there's
*  a health element to the honest discussion.
*  I think it's a good thing.
*  The Yoke edge part of it.
*  There's a health element to the Janice discussion.
*  How he'll age.
*  Um, the playoff's last couple of years were tough.
*  Yeah.
*  But, um, well, here's the problem.
*  Dramatic pause.
*  I think he's had the worst luck with teammates of any great player.
*  If you're talking about the top 15, never played with an RLNBA guy.
*  Murray gets hurt when he got hurt, cost two playoffs.
*  Now he's got Murray and Porter taking up 40% of the cap.
*  And I hate to say it.
*  I hope he's not here.
*  I doubt he is, but the owner was fucking cheapskate.
*  Like spend some money.
*  You have Nicole Yoke edge on your team.
*  You have one of the best 15 players of all time in his prime.
*  Go into the second apron, motherfucker.
*  So you have four, you have him 14th as of today for all time.
*  Yeah.
*  I need to see how this plays out, but he is in the nine to 13 range for me.
*  Now you could argue, you could make an argument for him as the ninth best
*  player of all time today, depending if he wins a fourth MVP, I think it's in play.
*  Here's where I lean to eight and see who he's hypothetically in range.
*  I'll give you the list just cause you guys all Jordan first.
*  Cause he's the goat until I die.
*  LeBron Russell Kareem.
*  That would be the Mount Rush.
*  Magic bird, Duncan will.
*  And then it's like, I originally had Ko, Curry, Kobe West, and then Hakeem
*  Shaq Moses and Yoke is just somewhere in that last six, but if he wins a fourth
*  MVP and he carries this Denver team to like the Western finals are better with
*  what we watched last night where he can't even come out of the game for two and
*  a half minutes, like he literally couldn't come out of the gate, the Mike
*  balloon and a call timeout because the team was cratered.
*  So I think he's somewhere in that range, but I think for me, just as somebody
*  who's watched basketball my whole life, I like he's, he does the same stuff bird
*  of magic did and he's been doing it now for six, seven years.
*  Do you think he, see, this is the ring counting thing.
*  Cause this is it, but this matters.
*  The ring part matters though.
*  All those guys won rings, especially when you put together that list.
*  I mean, Moses just has the one right.
*  Hakeem's got the two.
*  So then it should be a, it should be a, it should be a, it should be a
*  So then Shax got three or four.
*  Right.
*  He has the fourth.
*  Um, West only had one though.
*  Yeah.
*  But the West one, when you're losing to the Celtics every single year in the
*  finals, like I almost think we should just round it up to three for him.
*  Uh, when you'll get you, when it's all said and done, if he stays on this pace,
*  like say another four years, you know, as the MVP, I think the simple
*  tens will just count the rings and be like, you can't put them ahead of those
*  guys, but from just an impacting a game at that level and again, you know, we're,
*  we're assuming a lot in the next few years, but the guy stays healthy.
*  It's not like he's this wiry dude who has all these muscle pulls all the time.
*  Right.
*  Like, well, what happens if he does remember Larry Bird that one year when he
*  came, I think it was the 87, 88, not as well as you do.
*  All of a sudden there with the big off season storyline was Larry Bird has
*  quit drinking beer and he's in phenomenal shape and he showed up for the season.
*  And he had this follow up to hand dunk at a preseason game.
*  We're like, Oh my God, the legend he's in shape.
*  And then he got hurt with it.
*  I don't know if I believe the quit drinking beer part.
*  Well, probably not.
*  But I didn't think to me, Yocage like apparently has never really lifted.
*  I don't even know what his off season change program would be.
*  Whatever he's doing.
*  It's fine.
*  It doesn't.
*  Sometimes I think the guys, it's like the old quarterback thing where
*  Dilfer used to tell me, like, I wanted to come in like 20 pounds overweight.
*  He's like, I want a little sweater down there so that I could, as I tapered off,
*  I at least had something to take the damage.
*  I'm not necessarily saying like that's what does that too.
*  I think that's been trying.
*  He's like, this is ridiculous.
*  Um, you know, there was those next five guys that when you get to eight or
*  whatever, like it's just a player.
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, it's tough for me to put anybody above Duncan just because of how perfect
*  he was and how sustained it was and how long it went, but the fact I'm even
*  suggesting it's possible is, is the win is of today.
*  So you loved, you love Moses and you love to came.
*  I love Moses and Shaq, but he could just at least swimming in that.
*  I don't think I appreciated Shaq enough, but I was also like a shit head kid
*  and he was on the Lakers.
*  Yeah.
*  We had some weird things against Shaq where he was like, he made a rap album.
*  We're like, what's he doing?
*  Foosh.
*  Nickens.
*  He made Shazam or Kazam, whatever that movie was.
*  They're like, what a dick.
*  And then Dwight tried to do all of it.
*  We're like, all right, you're definitely.
*  Yeah, you, you were the dick.
*  Uh, I actually appreciate Shaq like way more now than I think I did.
*  And that might've been just a Boston weirdo thing that some of us grow out of.
*  All right.
*  Last section of yogurt porn.
*  We were, we were saying like, we try not to have biases, especially because we
*  have votes for OMBA and, and I like to think I'm level headed even like with
*  the Celtics, like I know in the Celtics.
*  No, listen, let me, let me talk this out right down the middle.
*  There's been seasons where I'm like, they don't have it this year.
*  Something's wrong.
*  I don't like this.
*  Like I tried to be objective.
*  Um, it's really hard for me to be objective with, with Yoke-age and I think it is you too.
*  So what are your other actual basketball biases that you can admit?
*  Do you want to go back and forth?
*  Yeah.
*  So we're admitting that we both want Yoke-age to get that second ring.
*  So the commoners, as long as it's not at the expense of the Celtics.
*  Yeah.
*  Like if the Celtics can't win, I would hope that he would be the one that
*  one would be my bias.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause like the Curry fourth ring for me was such a big deal and him too.
*  But, um, I felt that order.
*  I felt like it, it just changed.
*  It gave, I don't even know that that many people hate her.
*  I mean, if you want to find, Hey, it's pretty easy to find right now, but with
*  Curry, it just kind of changed.
*  I think it changed a lot of the way he was.
*  Yeah.
*  It was very similar to like the John Elway super bowl.
*  And, Oh, I forgot we're in Denver, the John Elway super bowl, but John Elway
*  was like this stats, couldn't get it done.
*  And they could drag a team to the precipice, but not, and then all of a
*  sudden he won and we never talked about it again.
*  And Curry was the same thing.
*  It's like, Oh, well he had to ran and that one year in 2015, all the
*  calves got hurt and there was always an excuse.
*  Now there's no excuses.
*  Um, all right, so bias, I'll give you a small one.
*  I'm rooting for the Pistons.
*  I have a lot invested in my K to Cunningham position.
*  I think that that's come around after some scary, like early developments.
*  Jade and Ivy being allowed to play in front of Killian Hayes seems
*  to be the right decision.
*  I wonder if Monty Williams has watched one Pistons game on league pass, because
*  I know he didn't watch one before he got the head coaching job.
*  If I own the Pistons, I might've been like, we're going to fire.
*  You're going to keep the 75 million, but you're going to be an
*  analyst for 45 games this year.
*  So his is down in the league.
*  No, and they had the same records, the wizards last year.
*  Think about that.
*  The same record and like, nobody wants to hear your Pistons are sneaky, kind of
*  good, you know, we never did that monologue luckily, but I would go, how,
*  there's no way, like just even if all these guys are morons, they're way more
*  talented. There's no way they're the wizards.
*  And we've seen with a little shooting balance, a little spacing that if you
*  don't lay some up for the Pistons on the wrong night.
*  Yeah.
*  So I just like that this year, I like seeing a team that is the more like I
*  just, I just like them being somewhat more entertaining because I probably
*  watch too many Pistons game because it's always the first game on in the West
*  coast, like a four o'clock when I don't want to be inside.
*  My first bias that I'll admit won't be a surprise to any of you.
*  Uh, hate's a strong word with sports.
*  I was like the word sports hate.
*  I don't actually hate anything.
*  So it's in the context of sports hate.
*  I, I hate the Lakers.
*  I just, I just do play and I think it's healthy.
*  I think it's a good thing.
*  I think there should be teams that you just don't like.
*  And, uh, part of it's their fans.
*  Like they started out well, right.
*  First couple of weeks and their fans got super chirpy about how we took the under.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, they lost by 40 tonight, maybe like 41.
*  Um, but it's just more, it's more fun for me personally when they're not doing
*  well and I might be a bad person.
*  Not going to apologize.
*  It is weird.
*  You know, when you're from the Northeast, you don't think anybody cares about
*  sports as much as you do, and there's some elements of that, but then when you
*  go out to LA and you're like, oh, these guys are all soft or whatever, the Lakers
*  thing is very real.
*  Yeah.
*  They have, they have good passionate fans.
*  I gotta hand it to them.
*  The other thing I've never understood is that there's just Kobe fans that aren't
*  Lakers fans.
*  Yeah.
*  They just hang out, you know?
*  And I remember there was like a Lakers, like it was a big Lakers game and I
*  think I was recording it.
*  So I was like, I'm going to go out, get outside.
*  I'm going to go to the beach.
*  And then I just see all these guys in Kobe jerseys at the beach.
*  And I'm thinking like, this is a huge game.
*  Yeah.
*  What are you guys doing?
*  And it's like, well, you know, talking Kobe.
*  Yeah.
*  One bias we have together.
*  Is there was nothing else that Lakers thing?
*  There's no, like, is there a version of that that you want?
*  Like, do you have kind of a thing you don't want to share?
*  What you hope happens this season?
*  Um, the Lakers panic trade would be really fun.
*  Like if they talked themselves into, you know, Zach Levine's contract, something
*  like that, just like taking more money on to try to save.
*  But I think they know, I think they're so bad on defense.
*  They're one of the top four worst defenses in the league.
*  That'll be a weird time though, before the deadline, because when you're
*  30 and you're LeBron or hell, even when you're 35 and LeBron, you can kind of
*  get away with putting the pressure on them.
*  But so far the Lakers have kind of shown like, yeah, we're not like the
*  picks became eligible.
*  They didn't do anything.
*  I actually think they did a great job in the draft.
*  There's, yeah, me too.
*  There's a version of a rotation here that should work where they're in the
*  playoffs, but if they go through a weird stretch and they don't, they're not
*  active or anything, the subliminal messages and that kind of stuff, like
*  you're going to have a good couple of weeks.
*  If you're a scoring point guard or a scoring wing and the Lakers are on your
*  schedule, you're fucking pumped.
*  You're like calling family members like, Hey, make sure you watch tonight.
*  I'm going to have 48.
*  Uh, one of our biases we share.
*  Okay.
*  We both, uh, are rationally in route for scoot Anderson.
*  We're still, and I have a pretty big scoop position and unfortunately we live in the
*  era of people could just cut out clips from your video podcast and then torment
*  you with them over the next two to 20 years.
*  And, uh, we had some, some pretty passionate pro scoot takes during the
*  draft and they're not aging well.
*  You got off to a good start.
*  I thought he looked bigger.
*  I'm like, this is great.
*  They're bringing off the bench, sort of like a mental reset.
*  The numbers are just as bad as they were last year.
*  Yeah.
*  I even got so desperate.
*  I called like one GM that I'm, I'm pretty close with what I don't think lies.
*  And I was like, you like scoot too though, right?
*  He's like, is this off the record?
*  Yeah.
*  I'm like, no, I just, just tell me that you liked him too.
*  Right.
*  It's like, well, a team took them third.
*  So I think a lot of people liked him.
*  I'm not giving up, but I, I'm not giving up on it.
*  Preparing myself for the day.
*  I have to, like when I had Jaylen Suggs on last year, cause Jaylen Suggs was
*  whatever it was, it was like the worst offensive rating of any single player.
*  His rookie year, like anybody that actually played.
*  And then I was looking up historically, like who else had done it scoot did.
*  And then I was like, Oh, well, Jaylen Suggs did, you know, and then we had
*  Jaylen Suggs on after that and he's turned it around and I brought up that
*  entire like stat profile to him.
*  And then I was like, what do you think about scoot?
*  And he was like raving about scoot.
*  He's going to be so good.
*  I was like, all these guys, what's he going to say?
*  Like, no, he actually sucks dude.
*  He's like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like,
*  no, he actually sucks, dude.
*  So you don't think like eight years from now we'll be in Portland doing a scoot
*  porn intro to our live podcast?
*  Probably not ruling that out.
*  Um, we probably get the venue now.
*  Tickets are available.
*  What else?
*  Give me another bias.
*  Um, I'm not sad about the Sixers.
*  And it actually circles back to the MB Yokech propaganda year where I don't, I
*  don't even know who I'm really mad at.
*  You know, I think Darrell's a great GM.
*  He and I don't exactly, I don't think we like each other that much anymore, but
*  it's okay.
*  We'll get through it.
*  But he, they did such a good job.
*  And yet all of us that have been around it long enough, we've been around it
*  long enough, you're like, all right, like I can see the good version of this, but
*  are you investing in the right people?
*  But you also do have a choice to invest in other people and you don't.
*  And then when MB took the extension like that, and it was kind of lost in all the
*  mayhem, I think it may have been lost in the woge wake of him being, you know, and
*  then the MB extension happens and it's almost one of those extensions where when
*  it's done, you wonder if you're the team, you're like, he took it.
*  Like he was like, yeah, sure.
*  With Tacon three more years.
*  Yeah.
*  Keep adding them.
*  Um, I, we were texting a lot during that time and the Sixers were checking a lot of
*  boxes that I would say would, would, I would call Rosilla trigger boxes.
*  Um, the guy saying just openly that it's all about April now and not playing back
*  to backs anymore, the off season workout stuff, the victory lapping before we've
*  seen the team yet is one that will trigger you from time to time.
*  What else did they do?
*  Well, then they also had, um, and bead, everybody kind of knew that he wasn't
*  really the locked in guy that you need to be like, if you look, it's a very
*  simple timeline in the NBA top draft pick score a bunch of points, you're
*  going to get your max extension.
*  And then it's like year seven or eight.
*  I think something kicks in for a lot of the special players.
*  We're like, okay, maybe it's not about all the points and I'm going to get the
*  accolades and I'm going to make all star and all this stuff, but like, I almost
*  have to figure out a way to be a more productive basketball player.
*  That's not just about the stat line.
*  And I think there's a lot of stat line players out there that people talk about
*  being really special that I'm like, I don't know, I know they're good at
*  scoring, but I don't know that they're great at like all the things that you
*  need to do.
*  They affect winning.
*  Right.
*  And it's as talented as MB is.
*  And I've always really liked his game.
*  I loved him before the draft, but we knew there was the weird injury stuff with him.
*  I actually always loved his personality.
*  I liked that he cried after the Kawhi shot losing to Toronto.
*  When he got shit for that, I was like, that's ridiculous.
*  Like this, this matters to him.
*  Yeah, that's a great sign.
*  So there was all these things for him that I was kind of rooting for.
*  And then you started hearing more and more of like, he's actually not taking
*  this stuff serious enough and you were wondering if that story was going to get
*  out and then it gets out within the own team meeting leaking.
*  Yeah.
*  And then he's like, I don't know who said this is like, you know, what
*  mad about the leak.
*  Yeah.
*  You can be mad about the leak, but be met like you at some point, you have to
*  get more mad at yourself.
*  And I know he's had all these different injuries and all these things, but
*  I've just, there was like a tipping point for me and you, when I did the
*  preview show with you, where I went, I cleared the floor for you because I
*  remember Zach Lowe, like, yeah, I just was waving everybody to the side.
*  Yeah.
*  He was like, I saw what just like LaMelo, but I, I, I remember Zach Lowe, who we
*  love, like did his top five players.
*  And it was this like.
*  Unarguable list of, of the five guys of Yoke, it's Janice, Luca, SGA, and
*  and I went, I think we need to stop just penciling him in despite that we know
*  what he was statistically to start that year.
*  And I think people were starting to, like, it's not like, Hey, finally, we're
*  all on the same page or realizing, but you know, get out of the second round.
*  That's it.
*  We don't, we don't value durability enough.
*  When we talk about players is one of my big lessons of the 2020s.
*  That's why Boston's all hypothetical and that, yeah, those two guys for
*  Boston play seriously.
*  Yeah.
*  They want to show up.
*  They play back to backs.
*  Uh, quick biases for me.
*  I want Seattle to have an NBA team again and I'll root for that team.
*  Um, and along what you just said, if you're not in shape, it's really hard
*  for me to like you that much.
*  And I feel that way about Luca.
*  Thanks, man.
*  No, not you, but I just feel like when these guys are making the money they're
*  making, it'd be nice if, if, if you worked out in the off season, doesn't seem
*  crazy to me, right?
*  It's your job.
*  Which is weird because Ben Simmons works out more than anybody.
*  My other bias is quickly.
*  I still defend Kevin Durant.
*  I don't know why it's like being in a bad marriage.
*  Like he, you know, it's funny to like social and I'm like, you don't understand.
*  He was upset.
*  They lost last night.
*  Cause if you wanted to just like, if you were forced in like debate class, like
*  you have to be the anti Durant guy.
*  This is going to be easy actually.
*  And I don't want to be that guy.
*  So I understand that bias.
*  I have two more biases.
*  What do you have before?
*  Go ahead.
*  Go ahead.
*  Go ahead.
*  Well, one of them is yours too.
*  I hate heliocentric basketball.
*  I'm just never going to like it.
*  I'm just not, and I really respect what Harden the Quippers are doing this year.
*  It's, it's way better than I thought.
*  The rubber under was 37 and a half.
*  They, I, it was almost a lock for me.
*  Um, and he's playing great.
*  I just don't personally like watching it that much.
*  And that's not going to change.
*  And then my last one is I want Jordan to stay the goat.
*  And I just, I just feel like he's the best and the years pass and people forget.
*  And, um, I just think he's still.
*  Levitates above anyone I've seen in person, even Yoke Hitch.
*  I have one last one little off the menu.
*  I was so happy that you were able to witness, not just the greatness of
*  Yoke Hitch, it wasn't the best Curry game, but it's all right.
*  We'll get through it to see Tyler Ford handle a review.
*  He's, he's my favorite official in the NBA and we had a front row seat to it.
*  And I kept nudging the group.
*  I'm like, watch this.
*  He doesn't fuck around.
*  Yeah.
*  I didn't realize you had a referee bias.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I mean, he knows how much I love him.
*  Like he gave me the shout out before the game starts.
*  And my friends are like, the official say hi to you.
*  And, uh, yeah, he asked us when the Sunday pod was coming back.
*  I was fired up.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think the other guy I tweeted a picture of being like, I like French
*  fried potatoes or whatever.
*  And then I was like, and so then he was kind of like, fuck him or Sillo,
*  but Tyler, you know, Bill Kennedy, I think has a sag card.
*  Oh, he's doing the reviews.
*  And so one man show.
*  Right.
*  And then Tyler Ford is like efficiency, efficiency, efficiency.
*  If you don't know Tyler Ford is he looks a lot like Jim from the town,
*  which is one of the reasons we're still, I love it.
*  It's also a plus because he looks like he's going to, uh, at any time say
*  who's cow we taken, um, all right.
*  New gimmick here.
*  We're moving out of yogurt.
*  Sporn.
*  We are moving to what we're calling the worry scale where I'm going to list
*  some topics.
*  You're having fun.
*  The first 30 minutes.
*  I didn't want to lose the crowd, but he might be coming up at some point.
*  Um, the worry scale one to 10.
*  Curry ever getting a fifth title one to 10.
*  How worried are you?
*  Well, worried because it's probably not going to happen, but I, the fourth one,
*  like I don't worry about his next ring the way I would about somebody who I
*  think deserves a recognition ties.
*  Kobe though.
*  Yeah, but well, I guess the number one option thing, Kobe was the number one
*  option for what?
*  Two of them.
*  Two of them.
*  Yeah.
*  Two for Steph.
*  Yeah.
*  I I'm a nine out of 10.
*  I don't know how they do it with this.
*  Where's I don't know how they do it either.
*  Um, do you think he'll ever be on another team?
*  I don't think like, I gotta say, I think not to suck up to the crowd, but I don't
*  think Yoko is ever not going to be on Denver.
*  I don't think, I don't think Curry will ever not be on golden state.
*  And I honestly don't think Tatum will ever not be on Boston.
*  I think, I think those are the three that I see stay in whole career.
*  Luca, Luca is an interesting one.
*  I don't, I don't know if I would bet on Luca staying in Dallas.
*  I keep waiting for the first mad international guy because it doesn't,
*  it hasn't really happened yet.
*  Yeah.
*  Who's a bad, I mean, Nurkic seems to get upset, but he's not really on the
*  level of what we're talking about here.
*  But when you look at the next pissed off NBA star that forces his way out of
*  something, I don't say this because I think it'll never happen, but it's just
*  something that you notice that it hasn't happened yet.
*  I think you're nuts to put Tatum in that group with the other two guys, by the
*  way.
*  You think he would leave?
*  I just think it's, he's still so young, never on another team.
*  I just think those would be my three.
*  If I had to pick three.
*  Try young Hawks, because if they haven't traded them yet,
*  LaMelo Charlotte.
*  Uh, next worry scale, Houston fucking up this cool rockets roster that we love.
*  How worried are you?
*  On a scale of one to 10, it's a three because it's an awesome problem to have,
*  but I like you.
*  They're one of my favorite league past.
*  They might be my go-to.
*  They're the MVP.
*  Right.
*  Cause I'm not only entertained, I'm trying to figure out how they're going to figure
*  it out.
*  And EMA is the best coach for this.
*  Cause it's just like, Hey, guess what?
*  You're benched for the fourth quarter.
*  Yeah.
*  And he'll bench Jaylen green.
*  He'll bench Jabari.
*  They have to play Van Vliet.
*  They kind of make this defensive decision where they'll go with Thompson over
*  Jaylen in some of these spots.
*  And then Tara Easton comes into rec shop and they're like, all right, we don't
*  need your bar.
*  He's spacing.
*  So there's lineup stuff that they're matching there long-term.
*  I don't know how, like they're probably better off getting out of the depth for
*  the next guy.
*  I don't know who the next guy is.
*  Cause what'll happen is you're going to end up ruining the value of your own guys.
*  Cause there's just not going to be enough minutes for dudes.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's a concern, but not concerning enough that they look, they're winning
*  games too.
*  So with like a three.
*  So the Rockets, they're in the, uh, they're in the NBA cup.
*  They play Golden state and there, I think there's seven to one on Fandl to win it.
*  I think they're a pretty live bet.
*  I was, I watched their okay.
*  See game on Sunday, the next day, cause it was against football and, uh, they
*  reminded me a lot of Minnesota last year where we, nobody wanted to say that
*  Minnesota was ready in like December, January, but they kind of were.
*  And it was like, wow, this would be soon.
*  And then it just kept going.
*  And I think Houston, that's how I feel when I watched them.
*  They're so good defensively and they're so athletic and they have so many
*  different lineups that there's just a bitch to play.
*  I love that game because it was one of those, you know, we've had some really
*  cool regular season games and I feel like Houston's in a lot of them just
*  because of the effort alone, but with no chat, like I didn't, that game will be
*  so different with the chat decision and how they want to pull Chengun away or
*  maybe they close with Jabari.
*  Like that's what I love is that email is like, I know where you were drafted.
*  I know you get paid this, you don't get paid.
*  Right.
*  He did.
*  He did care less.
*  This is what I'm going to do tonight.
*  And it's he's actually the tough love.
*  No bullshit thing is the best version when normally it's like the hand
*  holder for all the young guys.
*  That game, if you guys didn't see it, you ever see those Instagram videos when
*  the two cats are fighting and it's just like amazing to watch the athletic, the
*  cats are like, Oh my God, wow.
*  They just jumped off a table.
*  You watching a lot of cat videos.
*  I, I think the algorithm knows that I liked them.
*  Um, but they,
*  Hey, white picks up your phone.
*  Like I'm no longer worried.
*  Uh, but they were just so young and athletic.
*  It was, uh, it was a treat to watch next warrior scale towns in New York.
*  I was probably an eight before the season.
*  I think I'm like a two now.
*  It seems like they like them and he's playing really well.
*  I think the defensive part of it though, like their identity, their
*  identity is entirely changed.
*  So maybe that's what happens when you trade for Carl Anthony towns.
*  True.
*  Which is funny.
*  Which is funny that he's not on Minnesota and now their defense isn't
*  what it's supposed to be, which doesn't really make a ton of sense.
*  Even though I think like, look, nobody stops Jokic, but in that series, like he
*  bodied them up and the fact that it stayed in front of him is better for towns
*  than having to move around.
*  The Mitchell thing is another one of those things I can't wait to see.
*  Cause Tibbs won't care.
*  The cat's already paid.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, he needs, he makes, he might have closing lineups where he's like,
*  I don't want spacing.
*  I don't want five out.
*  I want some resistance at the rim or maybe the next year, like as long as we're
*  top five in offense and 15th on defense, we have a chance.
*  But yeah.
*  And he hasn't look if they lose, then they're going to get on his case.
*  They'd be like, what's up with these interviews?
*  But right now everybody likes it.
*  He's kind of thrown a no hitter right now.
*  I don't think he's had one weird interview yet.
*  I keep waiting for it.
*  Maybe the PR just keeps turning down all of these invites and not even telling them.
*  Smart.
*  Well, conversely, you mentioned Minnesota, Minnesota warrior scale.
*  I'm like an eight and a half.
*  Yeah.
*  So that team, the body language doctor does not like what he's saying with Minnesota.
*  Um, and then aunt called it out and to had that press conference after he was
*  like, we were all, we were too negative.
*  Every way we're all doing our own thing.
*  It was really kind of crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Look, they started 16 and four last year and they were the best defensive team in
*  the NBA.
*  So, I mean, this is like Nick's like to another level of disappointment to who
*  they are defensively, but they moved out cat.
*  They didn't bring them in.
*  So that part of it's really weird, but look, there's nights where aunt doesn't
*  look like he loves playing defense.
*  And even though he's making a ton of threes, I'd rather him not take 11 a game.
*  Deep in Genzo hasn't been good and Randall puts up numbers, but it's, it's all
*  kind of on his terms a little bit.
*  So they look very disconnected and it's a team offensively that I thought may get
*  their way of preventing them even making it to the Western conference finals.
*  As much as I like some of the guys on the team last year, it really felt like
*  they had an identity.
*  I knew what it was.
*  I didn't know if it was going to translate to winning four playoff rounds, but
*  there was something unique about them.
*  They show, I don't know when I watched them, I don't know.
*  They just seem like another team.
*  Well, at least they had the defense.
*  They knew they could rely like that.
*  They could take, they could take out Yoke edge as well as anyone.
*  Nobody takes them out, but they were at least, you know, big guys.
*  They had a real effect on and they could guard Jalen and Jason as well as anybody.
*  Now it's, I don't know.
*  I don't see it.
*  I don't think it gets better either.
*  Where does Randall rank for you on guys?
*  You wouldn't want to play pickup basketball with four hours a week.
*  It's like, Oh man, I'm on Julius's team.
*  Fuck.
*  Oh, he saw me.
*  You know, he's waving me over.
*  I always think it's funny is when like people just knock the NBA product and you
*  know, there's always like this weird push.
*  There was even an NFL push this year, even though there's a few Sundays where I was
*  like, this wasn't that much fun, but it's like, Hey, the NFL product.
*  It's always somebody with some kind of agenda, but there's a lot of the, the
*  NBA part of it and I'll have nights too, where I'll watch a game and like, there's
*  way too much to be point shooting tonight or why is that guy taking that shot?
*  And then I go, do you miss post-ups?
*  Do you miss them?
*  Do you watch these games?
*  You'd be like, I miss an Al Jefferson, like entry pass so bad.
*  And Randall backs guys down.
*  It's like, Hey, it's right there for you.
*  Right.
*  Like, there you go.
*  If you miss it.
*  I had this coming up later, but I'm glad you're bringing up now.
*  They, this became that, that, that one clip went around.
*  That was like two minutes.
*  It was terrible.
*  Lakers, suns, threes.
*  It was bad.
*  You guys must've seen that.
*  Right.
*  And it was just terrible three, terrible three.
*  And people were like, this is basketball now.
*  And I'm watching it because I'm old and I'm like, you guys don't understand how bad
*  the nineties were like watching Bobby Phil's trying to post up whoever watching
*  Anthony Mason, trying to split a double team.
*  Like they had a Mark Jackson rule because your post-ups took too long and how slow
*  it was like that.
*  Remember that Cleveland team with Brevin Knight where they, for Tello, like no
*  goal.
*  No, remember he slowed it down, slowed it down and tried to have like 65 field
*  goals a game.
*  Like there's 90.
*  I hope there's one person in this audience is YouTube, Brevin Knight possessions.
*  No, someone in the back is like, finally Brevin Knight has been, but I was
*  thinking like that clip sucked.
*  All right.
*  And if you show that and there's plenty of games, there's some D'Angelo Russell
*  warriors games where I go, I might have to take a year off from this team before
*  they get rid of them.
*  But then I think like, okay, what are you talking about that you miss?
*  And it, there was no movement so much slower.
*  Like even last night's a nice reminder.
*  I, and I hate this.
*  This is my thing, but somebody posts one clip of a piston's hard foul and they
*  act like that was every fucking possession of every game from like 1978 to 1996.
*  And you're like, actually that's just a really hard foul.
*  And we thought that was hard when it happened at the time.
*  And then you're watching guys cut and how physical even last night's game is
*  with two teams that wouldn't even be suggested as like, Oh, those are the two
*  most physical basketball teams.
*  The guys are so much bigger.
*  There's so much fat, like they're hitting each other off the ball.
*  The game is so physical.
*  And yet these dudes on TV just never want to admit that it might, it might be as
*  tough, even if there's more space.
*  Somebody did a study about how much more running there is now.
*  And it's, I just think basketball, it's way harder to play basketball now.
*  As great as that stuff and how much we can get nostalgic over it.
*  Like I'll watch a Celtics playoff game from the eighties.
*  Once the ball is crossed half court, everybody stops.
*  There's times I'm talking about like big playoff moments where they're not
*  picking somebody up who has the ball in transition, letting them because there
*  wasn't, you know, the, the, the, I would say the lengthening of the quarter, the
*  threat of deeper shots, because people just didn't take shots back then the way
*  they do now, but they would just almost let people get in to setting up what they
*  wanted to do.
*  And I would challenge anybody like go watch some of that stuff for 30 minutes.
*  And it's hysterical how different it actually is in the way people talk about
*  today.
*  Yeah.
*  We have a league where somebody's trying to win the fourth MVP and he's shooting
*  52% on threes and his tennis is, and he's the center.
*  People are like, this sucks.
*  And everyone forgets that the mid two thousands when we, we actually was like a
*  crisis with the pace of the game and just how much it sucked to watch that they
*  had to change his rules.
*  Anyway, uh, next one for the, uh, the warrior scale, we just got to get it over
*  with Jamal Murray.
*  Listen, we're all friends here.
*  Let's talk it out.
*  I don't want this to be like the sopranos intervention where somebody charges me.
*  Let's just, let's talk it out.
*  Jamal Murray.
*  How worried are you?
*  Not as worried as you are.
*  You, I don't know if I'm bad at it or you're dangerous, but you went in and you
*  were like, I don't think he's moving well.
*  And I went, I he's not peak Westbrook.
*  So it's, it's always a bit shifty into his.
*  I studied a lot.
*  I studied how he was walking.
*  Couldn't stop talking about him.
*  He actually, I think the quote was he's not the same anymore.
*  And I went forever.
*  And then he goes now.
*  So we decided, no, that was a game.
*  Doesn't have it right now or doesn't have it anymore.
*  Right.
*  Are two separate things right.
*  But you said right now, because he looks slow.
*  It doesn't look like he's in the same shape.
*  He was bad last night.
*  It was bad to see live.
*  He walks.
*  I'm going to do some walking for the, he does.
*  He just looks, looks creaky.
*  Like I, you know, I want my guys to walk around the court, like guys making 40
*  million a year with their chests out.
*  I just was, I just was worried.
*  I left the game thinking that guy doesn't seem a hundred percent healthy to me.
*  That was that.
*  I don't know if I'm right or wrong, but that was what I saw.
*  Beginning of last year when he came back, it looked different because he was coming
*  off the injury, right?
*  Yeah.
*  And then I think you could tell when it, when you, you know, you try not to just go
*  by like, oh, he's scoring more.
*  Everything is fine now, but he's a tougher one.
*  I'm not as good at this as you are.
*  I'm admitting I, I can't cause he is not somebody.
*  It's not like I have my own CBS show where I'm like the mentalist.
*  Would you turn it down?
*  Mentalist.
*  That sounds great.
*  The two, here are the two things I noticed that he used to have elevator pitch.
*  Doesn't seem to have the same way when he's going coast to coast and he's going
*  fast and he's got the defender on his hip.
*  He always had like a little super blast where he could get ahead of that guy and
*  get his shot and he doesn't seem like he totally has that yet.
*  And then he has that little, where he goes to his right, that little 12 footer,
*  the Chris Paul shot, which always used to go in and was like his kind of like,
*  that was his shot and it's not going in anymore.
*  And it doesn't seem like he has the same lift on it.
*  So that's just what I saw in person.
*  We'll see if it's fixed, but it's fear of the nuggets.
*  Like your ceiling depends on what happens with him over the next four months.
*  Cause you know, we have with the other guys.
*  Yeah. And he's been so great and huge playoff spots.
*  Everybody knows that.
*  And like when you can do that, that tells me everything about you that even if
*  you don't have the accolades of the other guys, I think the no all star team
*  thing is completely overblown.
*  Cause if you go through it, like every single year, it was, and when he was
*  healthy and when he wasn't the other guards that made the team, it's, it's not
*  as egregious as it's always pitched every time it's a national broadcast, which
*  seems to be some rule like Jaylen hurts squatting.
*  You have to bring up that Jamal Murray hasn't made an all star game, but
*  what are the other words like that?
*  Well, the all timer was Kershaw and Stafford went to high school together.
*  Oh, that's a good one.
*  Jim Harbaugh and John Harbaugh.
*  What Russell Wilson won.
*  Did you just yell Russell Wilson?
*  Trying to throw us off.
*  I have a, I'm an eight and a half for Jamal Murray for word.
*  Put me down as a 6.5.
*  He's too young.
*  He's too young.
*  He's conservative with this.
*  So I'm always like more panicky and you're more conservative.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, and be George Philly just as a group, removing all your, whatever.
*  I'm like an eight and a half.
*  See, I think you're right.
*  This is why it's an eight.
*  It's not a 10.
*  Okay.
*  The Pelicans are an 11.
*  Yeah.
*  Philly there is, despite the time we just spent talking to them, there's a
*  version of it coming together.
*  Well, the thing is they only have to be like the 10 seed that could be 34 wins
*  with Maxie George and bead.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm Sally and McCain.
*  Yeah.
*  They have talent.
*  I mean, Uberay who I can't stand is been pretty good for them for a couple of years.
*  I'm not crossing them off.
*  And he's, but it's not great.
*  Like when Uberay has to play somebody tough defensively with all that length,
*  like he's, he's into it.
*  He's kind of a different cat now.
*  So I got to give it to him.
*  So at least with Philadelphia, as bad as it is, it's kind of like the Clippers
*  thing, yes, it's a huge worry, but dot, dot, dot.
*  Now it never worked out for them.
*  And maybe it doesn't really odds are against Philadelphia, but there's something
*  there's in place where I don't see why they couldn't put together a couple of
*  months and we start talking about them being like, Hey, that's going to be a
*  weird, that could be a weird one.
*  Eight.
*  Here's why eight and a half might be low because Embiid was in the Olympics.
*  Look slow.
*  Look creaky.
*  Um, do his walk.
*  That, that wouldn't be tough.
*  I don't know if I could do that one.
*  Um, then before the season, it's like, we're taking it easy with him, but he's
*  doing great, his knees good, sign the extension.
*  That was a red flag.
*  It was like, why did he grab that extension so fast?
*  That was weird.
*  Um, then it was the ESPN sent who was a bond temps to read the big feature about
*  their whole master plan for it's all about April, May, and June.
*  Now it's like, that's weird.
*  Why are they telling us that?
*  Um, and then all of a sudden Embiid not playing tonight.
*  It's like, ah, the season started.
*  That seems like a problem.
*  Um, and then he played, he looked terrible.
*  Then he got hurt.
*  Then he was mad at his team.
*  The team meeting happened and then we haven't seen him since suspended for
*  Oh, yeah.
*  The only guy in the fight with the reporter or not the fight, but the, the
*  shoving thing.
*  And then I saw today another red flag and beat is ramping up.
*  What does that mean?
*  It generally means you've been disappointing.
*  What other parents just start using it?
*  How's Doug ramping up this summer?
*  Like if my son's grades, if I'm like, Hey Ben, how are your grades?
*  And he's like, yes, I'm ramping up, but how are your grades?
*  As long as you're ramping up.
*  Like, how's it going with the ladies?
*  I'm ramping up.
*  So you're single.
*  Um, Lamelo ball, worry scale.
*  Where are you really high?
*  Well, you're high.
*  He's averaging 30 a game.
*  He's second in the league in scoring and I'm worried now.
*  I know there's a large segment, not the great city of Denver.
*  Never want to hear Bill and I talk about Lamelo speaking of scoot takes.
*  And that's totally fair.
*  I didn't like the Australia footage.
*  Don't know how many times I can say it.
*  Having said that he's a incredibly talented guy at that size, the passing,
*  the, I talk about time, like his size, the start, stop, start again thing is,
*  is just stupid.
*  But when I watched the games and I see like, he took 35 the other night and
*  I'm like, you know, it's not a good shot is a one foot three from 30 feet out
*  with 16 seconds left in the shot clock.
*  And I think when you're allowed to just do that forever, cause he is their
*  attraction, he is the kind of the Trey young thing in Atlanta where this may
*  not be great, but the kids love them.
*  I wonder now on another coach who was supposed to be the guy.
*  And by the way, when he benched him in that nets game, I don't think it was
*  about the fourth quarter.
*  Cause I went back, I was like, where is the moment where Charles Lee's like,
*  I'm benching you in a tight game.
*  He made nine more substitutions and under four minutes, he was subbing in for
*  offense, he was subbing in for defense and he never put Lamello back in the game.
*  And I thought it was about the overall approach that he has to have.
*  He's obviously more talented and a more productive player than I thought he
*  would be before the draft.
*  But I think there's a tendency of like, he just kind of gets out there and does
*  his own thing.
*  I think it sucks to play with.
*  And I think it's losing basketball.
*  And this is a habit that he has to break to be something in this league other
*  than just a box score guy.
*  Year five, good stats, bad team guy.
*  He's probably the captain and his stats are awesome.
*  Stats are great.
*  Like even, even with the bad threes, like look at the three point, like the
*  numbers, he's a better shooter in the NBA now than he was at any other level.
*  Like, and it was immediate.
*  I've made this joke before and I'm going to make it again.
*  His destiny might be social media 15 years from now with clips of people saying
*  the mellow ball was a problem.
*  And just like a one minute highlight tape of crazy shots he made.
*  And that's where we land.
*  We'll see.
*  Next one.
*  Worriscale a stringer Avon situation with Franz and Palo and Palo comes back.
*  Are they going to be on the balcony together?
*  Franz is like, this is kind of my team now.
*  Here's why I'm not worried about it at all.
*  Because when you watch Palo at Duke, he actually wanted to get other guys
*  involved, even though he was clearly the best player, it was going to be the
*  number one pick.
*  Yeah.
*  So he likes this.
*  Palo is totally fine.
*  Getting other people involved, which is why I like him probably.
*  I mean, when Benyama is in his own planet, right?
*  But how low to be that good, that young and not have to have the seven year
*  run of, I guess I have to kind of find a way to play with other people.
*  Like that's in him already.
*  So with this front, I think this is just a nice Franz reminder tour of what he is
*  and how people got him the calves series.
*  So I, I'm not worried.
*  I think this is actually one of those weird injuries where it may be better
*  for the rest of the magic.
*  It certainly helped Franz.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause he Olympics wasn't great for started the season wasn't great.
*  The calves series, people were acting like he sucked.
*  I was one of them.
*  No, it's good.
*  Orlando's on my radar.
*  I'm the most worried about the calves in the East, obviously, cause I think
*  they're really good.
*  But I think I would put Orlando next for teams I'm worried about because if
*  Franz keeps up Boston or in general Boston, so you would run keeps this up.
*  The Boston threats are Cleveland, Orlando to you.
*  I think Orlando, cause of the defense and because if Franz can be the second
*  guy that you never know who's going to have the 35 point game, I'm not as, I
*  just can't be as scared of Milwaukee with the, with not knowing what I'm getting
*  from Middleton, I just don't know if we're ever seeing, but it's good to see
*  that they turn it around.
*  Cause Yannis has been insane.
*  And the Knicks are honestly just not good enough defensively.
*  It's never worked.
*  When, once you get to round three, round four, you have to be able to get stops.
*  And I don't know if they can.
*  Next one, worry scale.
*  LeBron going 89 Kareem on us as this year goes along.
*  Revisit 89 Kareem for those that don't remember.
*  So it was 30 six years ago.
*  It was the farewell tour season.
*  Um, Kareem was amazing.
*  I mean, he was, he had one of the most amazing careers in any sport.
*  He was the finals MVP, I think in 71 and 85 in 87, they ran the biggest play of
*  the game for him in game four.
*  He made it, got fouled 88.
*  Pisted series, biggest play of the entire series.
*  They ran for him.
*  He was like 42.
*  So he was an amazing aging player, but he was obviously old.
*  And then all of a sudden the 89, it was grim.
*  It was, it was bad.
*  And LeBron, like he put up 29 to that offensively, he can still do it.
*  The defense is, uh, you can't even call it defense because he's not playing it.
*  So he's basically, he's become a DH in basketball.
*  Um, and you still play pickup and I think you have a lot of pride in your pickup.
*  I, you're trying to figure out how to be insulted by that.
*  Um, I had a run in pickup when I was in my early forties, where I really
*  tried to keep it going and then eventually you start learning all these
*  tricks to survive in a pickup game when you're old.
*  And LeBron's doing a lot of those tricks now where I'm like, I used to do that.
*  Where he'd be like on defense under the basket, where he's just kind of doing
*  this and then, no, get that, get that guy.
*  And, and he's just not covering ground.
*  This is the worst comparison you've ever made.
*  Thank you.
*  Look, I can tell when somebody's trying to conserve their energy at a
*  basketball court comparing it to your pickup game in the forties.
*  I'm an only child.
*  What do you want?
*  I hope someone that despises you tweets that you said this at this show
*  tonight with no context whatsoever.
*  I might even retweet it.
*  I know exactly what you mean.
*  You're supposed to be my friend on stage.
*  I know.
*  Well, I think it's always good to be, you know, every now and then I got to,
*  I got to disagree.
*  No, but you know what I mean though.
*  And I do know what you mean.
*  I know what you mean.
*  But I mean, if I said like, Hey man, I always hit the cutoff guy in softball.
*  Nobody, trust me as somebody that tried to do that a few times, like I was
*  trying to explain why my defense and pickup.
*  What's that?
*  Do you still move on defense and pickup?
*  Um, I mean, it depends on, I usually will like, if you make three, I'm like, shit.
*  Like Matt liners kid just destroyed me a couple of weeks ago.
*  So how many years left for LeBron in your opinion?
*  Well, everything you said is right, but don't you feel guilty holding them to a
*  standard that we shouldn't hold them to?
*  Well, it's year 22.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what I mean.
*  So, I mean, some of this defensive stuff he's been, he's been doing for a while.
*  I mean, he's had the worst defensive assignment for years, which I think is
*  smart to try to pace him.
*  I mean, but now they have Austin Reeves and connect out there too.
*  And it's like, ah, I'm not going to be able to get that.
*  And it's like, ah, and Angela Russell, Russell now lock it down.
*  Now, it's got jammer in anybody.
*  I, uh, I think I'm at a stage and I've talked about this before, but I'm, I'm
*  with you, everything you said is right.
*  And when Denver played them, they had LeBron's guy stay baseline.
*  So LeBron was the baseline help kind of in the dunker spot.
*  And they were running these cuts.
*  Like it was a handoff at the high post and then somebody would cut down off of it.
*  LeBron just never ever rotated over.
*  And they're like, we're just going to keep doing this over and over and over again.
*  Um, he's had some tough fast break defense plays.
*  I mean, I thought he'd be, I thought he'd be on TV three years ago, you know, go
*  back to 2010 and we're talking about him and holding him to the standard defensively.
*  So this part I actually feel guilty about, even though you're right.
*  I guess my reaction is based on the, the dialogue about him heading into the
*  season and all the people in the media were like, he's still a top five guy.
*  The answer is no.
*  Um, next, where do you have them in your top 100?
*  He was not in the top 20.
*  Um, Whoa, that seems low.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I like defense.
*  Um, if Rudy three nest, what next?
*  Where is scale?
*  You still have worries.
*  I have one more.
*  All right.
*  The Celtics ending up with a crappy owner.
*  Oh, all right.
*  I'm, I'm laying out.
*  Let's talk this out.
*  Well, no, go.
*  Cause this is your world.
*  This is, you know, like an owner's insider.
*  I'm always nervous when I have a good owner and now I don't know what I'm
*  getting with the next owner.
*  I'm just going to naturally be nervous about that.
*  So I'm like a seven.
*  What if the next guy comes in and it's like a a rod Mark Loria
*  situation, like, Hey, we got to trade towns.
*  We got to trade towns.
*  He's too expensive.
*  Like that.
*  That's the shit that's happening.
*  We have the wrong owners.
*  What if it's John Henry?
*  Those guys have won.
*  We're moving on.
*  I'm going to save rather have right now because I want to get to your top five
*  movie TV girlfriends.
*  I asked for a cello.
*  We're going to break up the hoop of the little pop culture.
*  Five movie TV girlfriends that when you watch the show or the movie, you were
*  like, I'm in,
*  well, Megan Mark is available again, right?
*  Is she available?
*  Can you believe the word in the street after I think that podcast thing didn't
*  work out.
*  I think she's still married though.
*  No, but it was, it was a, we played in a,
*  celebrity flag football game together and it was all of the swimsuit models.
*  So nobody was really paying any attention to Markle.
*  So I was like, that's my lane.
*  Like she's probably, she's probably down herself a little bit right now and she's
*  never been more obtainable.
*  And then I mean, I got the game winning touch in over Deion Sanders.
*  No big deal.
*  And I was like, yeah, you know, I shot her a DM.
*  She shot her a DM.
*  Yeah.
*  And then somebody was like, do you know who she's dating?
*  I was like, I don't know.
*  I don't pay attention to any stuff.
*  And it didn't work out.
*  And no, it's the funniest thing.
*  And so then the joke kept going.
*  Cause when Pierce Morgan would lose his shit about it, I would always quote tweet
*  above and be like, it gets better, man.
*  It gets better.
*  It gets better.
*  It gets better.
*  It gets better.
*  It gets better.
*  It gets better.
*  It gets better.
*  It gets better.
*  It gets better.
*  It gets better, man.
*  Like, don't worry.
*  And I was basically only doing it for like Sarah Walsh and Carissa Thompson
*  because they knew the story.
*  They thought it was so funny.
*  So like nobody really knew what the joke was.
*  And I kept doing it over.
*  Like again, I don't do it that often, but maybe once a year Pierce Morgan would
*  have some other Meghan Markle thing come up.
*  And then I would just be like, don't worry, dude, I'm here.
*  If you need to talk ever.
*  And he never responded.
*  And the funniest person, the, you would never guess this.
*  The funniest person ever to reach out to me after one of those Pierce
*  Morgan tweets was like, dude, what is wrong with you?
*  She's not that great.
*  Like, have you paid attention to this hairy thing?
*  Like you're way better.
*  And if, first of all, you realize she wasn't going to go out with me.
*  All right.
*  So there's that part.
*  Jeff Van Gundy.
*  Come on.
*  Jeff Van Gundy texted me to tell me that I was better off without Meghan Markle.
*  That's a thing that actually happened.
*  And I was so like, I was at home solo and I'm, I'm on, you know, I'm like, what's
*  Van Gundy want?
*  Cause I don't, we don't text a lot.
*  And I was like, oh no, he thinks that Pierce Morgan tweet is real.
*  So then I had to explain the whole thing to him and he was like, I've lost
*  interest now and Mark Jackson texted hand down, man down.
*  I don't think Mark Jackson, I don't think he was ever going to text me after that.
*  That one monologue that I did where I was like, why does everyone keep asking why
*  he's not getting a head coaching job?
*  And I just went through like a 10 year timeline.
*  So not, not on your speed dial thing is too, is I love to me.
*  So Johnny, wait, one more question.
*  Yes.
*  What was the DM to Meghan Margo?
*  Is it like, was it like what shaken?
*  It was not what you are.
*  Yeah.
*  No, it was really, it was this Ryan.
*  No, it was a soft, very soft sell.
*  It was.
*  Hey, I know the new season of suits is coming out.
*  If you ever want to come on the show, come on the show.
*  Yeah, it was really professional and it was like a gauging of interest.
*  Like if I got an emoji back, who knows?
*  And I didn't, it was ice cold.
*  It was, oh, I don't know anything about sports, but thanks for the offer.
*  Next one.
*  So Meghan Markle, who else?
*  Well, is it weird to go all the way back to the Goonies?
*  No.
*  I left the movie theater in love with that girl.
*  Does anyone know what I'm talking about?
*  No, not, not the one with the glasses, but the other one.
*  Like, yeah, I don't, I don't know what the deal was, but it's never happened.
*  Yeah.
*  And who was that?
*  Brolin was rolling the bad guy.
*  Brolin might've stepped in.
*  Yeah.
*  I was like, what's she seeing him?
*  He had a car though.
*  And I think I was like 10.
*  So I think that was the first one where like I went to a movie and felt a little
*  different after I left.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  You don't know what the hell's going on, but you're like, why do I, why am I
*  looking at Bob magazine at the CVS the next week with her on the cover of that?
*  So that's one.
*  Did you have ones that we don't have a slideshow for this, right?
*  Cause this now feels incredibly awkward.
*  After I told them, our goal thing.
*  Slideshow would have been good.
*  My moment for that was the Charlie's angel.
*  I was like, I'm just a different person though.
*  What about the town?
*  All right.
*  Let's just get to it and said, cause I don't, I don't.
*  So Blake Lively in that movie, like I had a stretch where I was in Boston, where I
*  would see the Blake Lively's and it's one of the most accurate characters in the
*  movie.
*  And it's one of the most accurate characters in the history of movies.
*  When you guys do the Oscar revisit thing, have you ever nominated her for like
*  supporting actress?
*  I mean, you don't even need to.
*  It's just a given.
*  She nails it because she's so dangerous.
*  She's the worst idea ever.
*  And you know that you're in and I thought, and has a kid.
*  So one of the most dangerous gang members in town.
*  I love kids.
*  So somebody's smoking.
*  We're in Denver.
*  Everything's possible.
*  I think she might be back there smoking.
*  She would smoke in the car when she met your parents the first time.
*  The reason why she was modeled, she was modeled after these girls that like none
*  of us really knew how to talk to.
*  But at the same time, like you never, I wanted to date one and have every one of
*  my friends tell me how terrible it was.
*  I wanted to lie to my parents that I wasn't seeing anybody and I wanted to date
*  her all the time.
*  And I wanted to go up to like Medford.
*  I wanted to go to these danger.
*  Like I went to revere one night when I was in my twenties to scope this out.
*  Like I was like, I'm going to revere.
*  I just want to see it for real.
*  And I was like, I think I'm going to get my ass kicked here tonight.
*  So I'm going to have to leave.
*  So it never really quite worked out for me.
*  I knew what kind of hair was going to be like a bad dye job, like sort of a
*  Jennifer Aniston thing that was way out of style.
*  And then the streaks that weren't blended properly because she went to some cheap
*  place in a strip mall.
*  Like I had it.
*  I was like, look, I'm on TV for the Celtics.
*  There has to be something like, oh, he gets, he gets fucking great seats.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, but I was losing my hair and I was losing my confidence a little bit.
*  So.
*  Never happened.
*  She's still the ideal though, right?
*  I think I have a little different standards now.
*  Should we tell the story about when we met?
*  Yeah, because that guy.
*  That guy would have loved the Blake Lively character.
*  That guy.
*  I actually was to be totally honest.
*  There was one deal that was sort of close and I got dumped because she got on a
*  reality show.
*  I wasn't bummed out.
*  That was the best thing is that, you know, it's bad for you.
*  And when you get dumped, you don't even care.
*  Like a cable show or a network show.
*  No, it was like fairly, fairly popular.
*  Prominent show.
*  Yeah.
*  And then when she was, I was like, you didn't even win.
*  Now you want me back.
*  So we met.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  You can tell that story.
*  Well, it was, it was the first great Celtics moment in nine years.
*  It was the game when the playoff game against the Nets game three, where they
*  were down like 25 came back really ugly game, but really fun.
*  And it was, everyone was just so happy.
*  The Celtics had a nice, happy playoff moment.
*  It was like, it just literally nine years is really, really fun.
*  And it was, it was a really fun, really fun experience.
*  Playoff moment.
*  It was like, it just literally nine years is forever.
*  And it was a day game and everyone went out and it was one of those just
*  drunk, drunk, drunk Boston days.
*  And that's where I met Rossello and he was not sober.
*  It wasn't that game.
*  I thought it was.
*  No, was it a different game?
*  It was a Pacers playoff game.
*  That you're right.
*  Week.
*  It was also a great game.
*  That was the Paul Pierce over.
*  Yeah.
*  I knew it was a playoff game from back then.
*  So are you sure it wasn't that night?
*  I think I might be right.
*  No, cause you were getting married that week.
*  You're right.
*  And I would just started at that station, the zone in Boston.
*  Yeah.
*  And you had just left and gone on to other things.
*  And so we had just kind of missed each other, like just missed each other.
*  He came on, like did a phone or he was, he was nice enough to.
*  To find some time for us.
*  And then I hadn't actually met him and a bunch of my guys from Vermont came down
*  because it was like the first time I'd ever been able to like do my friends
*  a favor with a hookup.
*  So I got us like four seats in the suite.
*  And like, you know, that age, you're just going to get after it
*  cause your friends are in town.
*  And then I was like tight white t-shirt.
*  I mean, I looked like an extra and that I remember the outsiders and.
*  Bill's there with like his soon to be wife, I think her parents, your parents,
*  but it was at the fours, I think.
*  Is that the fours?
*  I have a completely different memory.
*  And so he was down.
*  This is great.
*  It's like one of those movies where it's two different stories.
*  Well, we're colleagues, so I'll go say something.
*  And I was, was like, Hey, the.
*  Heathcliff, slow come trade for Veritek and low was the best since Andy
*  Dufresne bought that rock hammer from red line, man.
*  I'm like, that was, that was something else, you know?
*  And I've got like a core's light and I'm like, you know, like, yeah, well,
*  we're getting married tomorrow.
*  So you were nice, but it was, it was over.
*  And I, I didn't, I realized 30 seconds later after it was over, I was like,
*  Oh, I guess this is over now.
*  And that was the beginning of this.
*  That's not what I remembered.
*  This is what happens when you get old.
*  You have these memories and then they morph into a different memory.
*  It'd be really weird if we had met after that nets game and then the, but I
*  know where I was after the nets game.
*  Can we play some rather have right now?
*  Yeah.
*  I get a list.
*  I'm excited.
*  And beater Kawhi, who would you rather have?
*  I have the same one down for you.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Uh,
*  okay.
*  Embiid cause he doesn't have a ring.
*  I think I would rather have them be too.
*  What's the quiet argument?
*  My Clippers guy was telling me Kawhi's coming back.
*  Is he ramping up?
*  Christmas and he's, I think he's ramped up.
*  He's ramped up, ready to go.
*  But, uh, I don't think the thing just doesn't feel like it's headed toward a
*  good place, right?
*  Like what?
*  Wait, give me the best case scenario for the Embiid situation.
*  Like comes back.
*  He's like, you know, the team meeting, I really, I did some soul searching.
*  He needs to follow the Duncan model.
*  He has to get lighter.
*  All right.
*  Well, that's not going to be this season.
*  Uh, Zion or Trey.
*  Yeah, it's actually Trey.
*  I mean, it's Zion.
*  Can you believe that you were like Zion's number one guy?
*  I'm no longer his number one guy.
*  What about Zion or Ja?
*  Ja.
*  August, would you said Ja?
*  See, to me, the willies.
*  Yeah.
*  Should we have done the live show at shotgun willies?
*  Oh, I know a guy.
*  Apparently.
*  Yes.
*  Jesus.
*  See, I had John John or Halliburton.
*  Ja or Halliburton.
*  I think this room's a little high on Ja.
*  I'm still in on Ja.
*  He's, he's awesome.
*  But I mean, he basically said the other day he's going to stop dunking.
*  That seems alarming.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause I do.
*  I would like every time I'd watch him, I go, I love this.
*  And like those grizzlies, like spikes that didn't really amount to anything.
*  Cause they were always hurt.
*  Like they put together some really nice stretches.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe this five and I think the front office does a really good job with everybody,
*  but I thought there was like a Ja Zion off the court thing.
*  Did you see Zion hit up that ring girl from Alabama?
*  I did.
*  Well, I guess the question for me is, who knows?
*  Maybe I could take a couple of lessons.
*  If they could get out of the Zion contract after this year, do you do it?
*  Is a question I can't believe we're even asking, but I think it's a serious
*  question is we reevaluated in two weeks.
*  So I'm excited for that.
*  But that story today that the Pelicans aren't going to wave them.
*  Like there's sometimes you're like, maybe this isn't really updated information.
*  Like no shit.
*  You're not going to wave.
*  Right.
*  Next, rather have bone X or Jaden Daniels.
*  Jaden.
*  I agree.
*  But can you believe this is an argument?
*  No, it looks like Drew Brees.
*  Like it's like Peyton is just sprinkled Drew Brees Kool-Aid all over him for eight
*  weeks.
*  Well, think about this.
*  Like McShane, I did this two weeks ago of the.
*  All right.
*  So it's six quarterbacks in the top 12 panics hasn't played.
*  JJ was hurt.
*  So we've got Caleb, we've got Jaden, we've got Drake, we've got Bo.
*  And if I asked you right now, hey, if in five years, any one of them were the
*  best of this group, it's all still on the table.
*  Right.
*  Except it's not because it's going to be Drake May.
*  Hey, I'll fucking leave.
*  Drake May is amazing.
*  I'll say this with next.
*  I watched that Jets game.
*  Would he have 60 yards in the bad weather and the Jets kicker missed the field
*  goal and the Broncos somehow won this before the Broncos turned the season
*  around.
*  And it looked like he was going to be like out of the league in three weeks.
*  And you watched the guy the last couple of weeks and he just looks completely
*  legitimate.
*  Like he can make every throw he runs around.
*  He'll make like two mistakes, but I like his leadership.
*  I like that he gets in fights with the other team, starts barking at defensive
*  linemen.
*  That Max Crosby highlight got you.
*  He just has it.
*  I think he's got it.
*  I think he's got charisma.
*  I like them.
*  I don't know what the ceiling is and I know he's like 25 and maybe this is the
*  ceiling already, but he's, he's, he's an average to above average start in
*  quarterback.
*  I'm serious.
*  So like if he ends up being like a real guy, you know what I mean?
*  You know, we're talking about here signing up for 10 years.
*  I, you know, I don't know if we'd start counting Superbowl rings here, but he
*  answers your quarterback question for a decade, which is what you're hoping for
*  with, with any of these guys.
*  You may have to just start drafting guys, but like how many games have you played?
*  You haven't played 50 in college.
*  We don't want anything to do with you because they keep getting it wrong.
*  And when you look at how many games he's played, how many games Jayden's played,
*  like maybe it's just trends and it all kind of changes year to year, but it seems
*  like there's real value in avoiding, at least avoiding the guys that have like
*  25 starts to their, their career in college.
*  The situation piece, which everyone talks about, I mean, he came into an incredible
*  spot too, which can't be understated, right?
*  Like Sean Payton is like, I'm taking this guy 12th.
*  I'm making this work.
*  I'm going to turn him into a QB.
*  This is, this is all I care about.
*  And it actually happened.
*  I also thought it was going to be, he's going to be in the playoffs.
*  Yeah.
*  Like when he got to knew it was Sean Payton, then it kind of turned into a thing where
*  it was like, Oh, so Bo Nix can do this, but Russell Wilson can't.
*  And I just want to be like, maybe Bo Nix isn't the most annoying human being in the NFL.
*  What did you have?
*  All right.
*  Matherin or Peyton Pritchard.
*  Let's just say I handed in a ringer 100 top players list.
*  No, you didn't.
*  Oh, not only did I, I put him in the eighties.
*  He's been incredible.
*  He's the best.
*  He's the best bench guy in the league.
*  He's been awesome.
*  I mean, there's metric when I was going through my top 100 and doing it, and I was
*  looking at like, you know, just all the different things that you want to prioritize
*  or are there any secrets in here?
*  Some of the metric stuff for Pritchard.
*  I'm like, how is he?
*  He's up here with these guys.
*  And by the way, white got scratched the other day and I was like, Pritchard's going off,
*  man. Watch that.
*  And he had like 29.
*  I can't believe you're not in on this.
*  He's been he's been the best bench guy in the league.
*  It's 20 games, 80th best player in the NBA.
*  It's a 350 player league.
*  It's in the top quarter or 450.
*  McCain or scoot.
*  Pass.
*  OK, we don't pass, Tina.
*  How about Tatum or SGA?
*  That's a.
*  The advanced stuff is like.
*  You used to be on the Tatum side of that.
*  Hmm.
*  No, I love Tatum.
*  I think Tatum doesn't get enough credit for sorry to steal your routine here, but.
*  Is his setting the table like even some of the bad shooting nights through the
*  playoffs last year, like watching those, you know, the Curry MVP thing in 15 to
*  this day is going to bother me the rest of my life when I die.
*  I hope the first thing someone says will be he was still really mad about
*  Igor Dalla getting the 2015 MVP because everything that happened was dictated off
*  of what they were doing to Curry.
*  Like, you know, and he would all I got it because LeBron was held the 40.
*  And so when I think about Tatum's impact versus all the other people that benefit
*  from it, I think that part of Tatum's game isn't discussed enough because he
*  also can be a bucket whenever he wants.
*  But the SGA thing is it's kind of hard to deny some of the advanced stuff there
*  that he's just at a double the level than Tatum.
*  I have Tatum slight edge.
*  I shocked.
*  I listen, I had SGA over him.
*  I thought the last month Tatum played was the best I've seen him play on both
*  ends, everything he's doing.
*  I just feel like he's gotten to another level.
*  His shot, he fixed it.
*  Rebounds, he plays hard every night.
*  I just think it's harder to find six nine guys than guards.
*  Is he East Coast Yolkich?
*  No, I would never say that.
*  Played center on defense in the NBA finals, played point guard on offense.
*  Yeah, does he love horses?
*  I got one for you, Jordan Poole or Draymond Green?
*  As a roommate.
*  I think that would be a fun one for road trip.
*  Jordan Poole.
*  I'm on my basketball team, probably Draymond Green.
*  Dinner.
*  Interesting.
*  Maybe Draymond.
*  Draymond.
*  I'd have a couple of good stories.
*  Yeah.
*  How about Otani or Connor McDavid?
*  Give me McJesus.
*  I think I agree.
*  I started like putting Oilers games up on the field.
*  I started like putting Oilers games up on Wather NBA playoffs games.
*  And I had this I had to turn off
*  McJesus because I would turn back to the NBA games.
*  You have like missing.
*  I was like, I haven't watched 20 minutes.
*  I have no idea what happened.
*  Anthony Edwards or Drake May?
*  I don't care about the Patriots anymore.
*  So post Brady don't care.
*  And 100 times out of Drake May has it.
*  You've heard me.
*  Did you say any of these things about Mac Jones?
*  He's comparing him to rookie Mac Jones is insane.
*  He's so much better than Mac Jones.
*  Mac Jones had a good first three months.
*  He was good.
*  I remember like a little Mac is giving off early Brady vibes.
*  It was 2001 Brady vibes.
*  That's why I said early.
*  I always love that.
*  It's amazing.
*  It's a great Peyton Manning rule.
*  And I need to do these.
*  I'm going to track these, maybe write a small book on it.
*  But whenever a rookie QB has a million interceptions, they're like, well, Peyton had 30.
*  I'm like, OK, I guess he's going to be Peyton Manning.
*  And any time a quarterback didn't do a ton, but they just won games.
*  Tom Brady did that.
*  Like, great. I guess it'll be Tom Brady.
*  You or me here?
*  I got a couple left. I got like two left.
*  God.
*  Mobly or lively.
*  Mobly. You like laughing that much.
*  I just wanted to see where you were at with it.
*  I'm still I kept my mobility position.
*  You're aware he's not going to be like.
*  That right.
*  I'm not giving up.
*  I'm an optimistic guy.
*  We'll see.
*  OK, teams playing well.
*  How about this one?
*  Sean Peyton or Jim Harbaugh?
*  Wow, a lot of Harbaugh's.
*  Harbaugh's my new neighbor.
*  Give me Harbaugh.
*  I think I would take Harbaugh, too.
*  But I think Peyton's done a really good job at the Broncos.
*  Jamal Murray or Dame Lillard?
*  I thought Malone's comments last night were pretty interesting.
*  It's like Jamal was getting hunted like a dog.
*  It's like Jamal was getting hunted late in the game.
*  Like that was the primary thing that Golden Say wanted to get into.
*  And then Malone was like, I hope he knows.
*  And he takes pride in the fact and like, make sure that doesn't keep happening.
*  Having said that, Dame will be hunted defensively.
*  He's hunted on the way to the game.
*  So he's he's probably a better like peak.
*  Holy shit score. But see, as I say that, like,
*  Dame's had more of that in his career, but those Jamal playoff games
*  are a huge deal for me.
*  So Jamal and the age thing.
*  I would take Jamal because I feel like there's another level to where he can get
*  to where Dame is, where he is now at the age he's at and who he is.
*  Dame's a much worse foul baiter, too.
*  It drives me crazy.
*  Roger Goodell or Adam Silver?
*  Well, if we both pick silver, people are going to think we're doing, although if
*  you pick silver, I think people would understand why.
*  I'm going to go with silver just because I felt like the NFL had a stretch there.
*  And again, the commissioner is the mouthpiece of ownership.
*  So you always have to remember that.
*  But the NFL ownership run there was just so gross, so arrogant and so dismissive
*  of people like the NBA has never had a run like that.
*  That's well put.
*  I think if I was an owner, I would rather have good though.
*  Is that because as a human being, I would rather have Adam Silver.
*  But if it's somebody to run my business like right now, like because Paramount got
*  bought, the NFL has it out in their deal.
*  You just know Goodell is going to be like fucking Tony Soprano with it.
*  Like he's like, you're going to pay us more and that's how it's going to play out.
*  And he's just so he is.
*  Yeah.
*  The TV thing is a lot like college football to me because anybody that's heard this
*  rant, I'm not, I promise I'm not going to do it again right now.
*  But like there has to be a point of diminishing returns of having, I don't know,
*  Cal play SMU in an ACC fucking game.
*  All right.
*  So when I look at people losing track of who's where and how dumb and imbalanced the
*  schedules are and leading to all sorts of nonsensical results from the season, it's
*  like, okay, how much further can college football push the money grab to where maybe
*  start turning people off and clearly the NFL is there.
*  Well, no, because I think the live rights thing, as we both know, you know, whether
*  it's our time at ESPN and understanding of being the priority, which it should have been,
*  but they are treating it like cocaine and they are cutting it up as much as they
*  possibly can.
*  And they're putting it on every single corner.
*  And you're like, I still have an NBC streaming subscription.
*  I'm like, how the, how did that happen?
*  And when they did that last round of packages, it's like, they don't even care.
*  And it's actually kind of smart.
*  It's like, why are we doing deals with two or three networks?
*  Put it on eight and everybody will get their little piece and that'll drive up the price.
*  And I always wonder if there's a moment in time where it's like, we did too much of it
*  and it actually kind of hurt it.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I wondered that as well.
*  And then I was so excited.
*  There was a black Friday game.
*  I was like, Hey, I apparently they could have the NFL every day of the week.
*  Three Thanksgiving games.
*  There's like, wait, the Raiders are playing.
*  I get to watch, uh, eight and O'Connell.
*  I'll never say chiefs team.
*  That doesn't care.
*  I'm in.
*  Do you guys remember that Denver Thursday night or two years ago?
*  Colts, right?
*  Denver Colts.
*  I was in Vermont.
*  I was in a hotel room.
*  I'm watching it on my laptop because I couldn't get prime on the TV.
*  And it was one of the worst things I've ever watched.
*  And I remember this amazing, like empowering moment.
*  Or I went, I'm going to turn this off.
*  Yeah.
*  Like I don't have to watch.
*  I think they've done a better job with the Thursday schedule this year.
*  Thursday schedule is way better.
*  It's Packers lions on Thursday.
*  That's the other thing.
*  And it's all guys.
*  The NFL is like, as soon as you get a couple of games, you're like,
*  we're going to give you some really weak product.
*  Yeah.
*  But first we even like the Christmas games.
*  The games are pretty good.
*  Well, like Casey Pittsburgh might actually matter.
*  The nice thing about the NFL doing the Christmas thing is that
*  Goodell told us that that was because football is family.
*  I'll say this.
*  It really bothered me that the NBA got rid of Thanksgiving games and that
*  they're so scared of the NFL now.
*  Well, what about the Thursday TNT thing?
*  Like we have to wait basically now.
*  And look, I used to love betting on Aaron Brooks at UVA and in college
*  when it was the Virginia Thursday night ACC thing.
*  Like that was my shit.
*  And that was one of the great college games.
*  It was so awesome to have that on a Thursday.
*  And now again, everyone's just so terrified of them.
*  But I thought the NBA, I thought it was nice to have those two.
*  And instead they have 15 games on a Wednesday.
*  You can't watch, you know, as you can't watch all of them at the same time.
*  And I just, I don't know, like, I feel like they've moved too far away.
*  They already got the TV deal.
*  It's not like, oh, ratings are down.
*  People always love to do this with the email.
*  The ratings are down.
*  Who cares?
*  They just signed an 11 year deal.
*  You think they give a shit?
*  Like they got the money already.
*  So put more games on times when I want to watch.
*  I don't even know what ratings being down means because every time it
*  happens, then the TV deal triples the previous one.
*  I don't know either.
*  I don't know.
*  I've never been a ratings guy.
*  When you have them.
*  No, I'm just like when it became like a thing about, oh, ratings are down 12%.
*  I was like, all right.
*  I like fastest growing show in America.
*  Oh, that's a good one.
*  There was a couple of shows at ESPN that just were at a zero and they were ramping up.
*  Or they replaced the worst show possible.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  And then I'd be like, who keeps track of fasting show in America?
*  That would seem like a huge deal.
*  It's like, well, if you start at zero, who can really say that?
*  I have one more for you.
*  Yeah.
*  Would you rather watch 90s NBA players at the TNT desk after a wizard's hornets game
*  or an MSNBC panel after the election?
*  Can I pass up both?
*  I got one more for you.
*  Yellowstone or land man?
*  Early Yellowstone.
*  There's a version of events where if I had moved out here, I would have modeled
*  my entire thing after rip.
*  Duly super inefficient gasoline.
*  The wind visor hat probably would definitely get my ass kicked more than Rip did.
*  But, you know, there's sort of like, you know, I'll get you.
*  You know, there's sort of like, you know, we can be a certain age, but this is all a
*  little make believe.
*  I would hope some of us.
*  So yeah, early Yellowstone rip is really high up there for me.
*  Although I think the show, it's tentacles went into a bunch of different directions there.
*  I love land man.
*  Have you watched?
*  I've seen the clips.
*  I've not I've not dug in yet.
*  Land man is unbelievable.
*  It's Billy Bob Thornton clearing out the mellow on the Charlotte Hornet style.
*  He's just like, can I shoot 35 times today?
*  And Taylor Sheridan's like, you can.
*  And Ali Larder comes in and she's like, can I just be like a way crazier,
*  varsity blues, older person version of that?
*  He's like, absolutely.
*  And then like, should we do stuff with the daughter that's kind of inappropriate
*  with older characters on the show?
*  And Taylor Sheridan's like, done.
*  It and then things blow up every once in a while.
*  It's great.
*  Where are you with John Ham texting?
*  Can you text him after an episode?
*  I would not.
*  I would not.
*  Yeah, but I think that's like a real you and him.
*  I would like to if I liked it, but I wouldn't be like,
*  I don't know about episode four.
*  Well, I didn't expect you to do that.
*  That would be actually be an amazing friendship.
*  The funniest thing is, did you realize you peaked?
*  The funniest thing is Demi Moore's in this show.
*  Good for her.
*  I actually like what Sheridan's casting is.
*  Awesome.
*  Let me finish.
*  She doesn't have any lines.
*  Oh, I haven't watched it.
*  I think she's had like five lines and four episodes,
*  but they make it seem like she's in it.
*  But she's kind of like Joel Embita on the Sixers where it's like,
*  is that he's not playing again?
*  So I don't know whether they were doing her a favor or she couldn't
*  be for the first five episodes or what's going on.
*  Maybe we want your comeback story to be this, but you don't have to do anything.
*  I haven't watched it.
*  I'm in a deficit here.
*  I really liked it.
*  But you do watch old succession episodes.
*  Yeah, I love it.
*  I think I had an epiphany recently where it has surpassed everything else
*  as my favorite show.
*  And like we could all go with The Wire and Sopranos and I love Mad Men.
*  I loved it.
*  But there's something about succession where the show found a way to put stuff in it that
*  it didn't need.
*  I'll use a small example here.
*  I promise not to go too long on it.
*  But the election night episode where they already have everything they need.
*  It's going to be this close election.
*  The Roys are going to have to be put in a situation where they're going to have to
*  make this decision and call the election for Menken and Shiva is going to fight against
*  them.
*  So they get the back and forth and Tom is just lost in all of it.
*  But the fact that in that dramatic, I don't know, hour long show, but in that moment,
*  it's a few minutes that Greg gets Wasabi on something so that their data guy,
*  their Nate Silver gets Wasabi in his eyes and Greg is dumping lemon flavored La Croix
*  into his eyes.
*  And in the script, Greg is yelling, it's not that lemony.
*  It's just a hint of lemon.
*  The brilliance to be able to write all the stuff that matters.
*  And that episode could have not had that.
*  And it still would have been a great episode and the tension of the election night.
*  And now what's at stake and how wrong they could have got it and everything that develops
*  off of that, that they were like, let's just have a moment where Greg gets Wasabi in the
*  data guy's eyes.
*  It's just not a lot of shows.
*  It's great.
*  So you've been binging succession.
*  I've been binging Sopranos and I might have to, I did the full circle.
*  I started on like right at the end of season four, went all the way through to finish
*  because there was a marathon.
*  I'm like, all right, I want to keep watching.
*  And I got to the end and I was like, season one.
*  And then now my, and my wife is just furious now.
*  She's like, what the really again, you just did this two years ago.
*  So maybe I need to shift the succession.
*  Cause I feel the same way about the Sopranos that you do about succession where I can just
*  watch the same episode over and over again and just learn, find new things.
*  You know what I love on a rewatch and I think AJ was awesome.
*  Yeah, he really was.
*  He was so good.
*  That doesn't seem very nice.
*  He didn't know.
*  Well, let's, let's end with this.
*  How many cities could you have actually lived in?
*  And I mean, actual cities, they can't be like, you can't say off the beaten path.
*  Like cities that have to have at least one sports team.
*  How many could you have a sports team?
*  You have to have at least one.
*  So Hartford's out.
*  Yeah. Hartford's out.
*  That's right.
*  Hartford was going to be one of my go-tos.
*  Well, I always want to move to Hanby's accomplished.
*  I did want to live here.
*  It was close, but I could live here.
*  I love it here.
*  Great group of friends.
*  I've just never had a bad time coming to Colorado.
*  So Wyoming, we're all for one.
*  I just got that.
*  For me, Boston and LA, which I've already done.
*  I absolutely could live here.
*  I really like it here.
*  What about San Antonio?
*  Texas, I'm out.
*  Chicago.
*  The extreme weather, I'm out.
*  That's why I love Boston.
*  Seattle, if they had an NBA team, I'd really consider it.
*  And that's about it.
*  It would take a lot to get me to leave LA.
*  On Thanksgiving, it was 70 degrees.
*  What about where the Panthers play?
*  Where's that?
*  I don't know.
*  So that's it.
*  So you could move here, but you would...
*  Well, once you said NBA town, it screwed up my whole St.
*  Bart's thing.
*  Since NBA, you could have any team.
*  No, because I think...
*  Because some people are like Nashville's getting momentum now.
*  No, because you guys think I bought this boat for luxury purposes.
*  And it's actually my exit strategy.
*  St. Bart's Rye, boat captain, NBA pod once a week to cover the boat excise tax.
*  From the boat?
*  No, it just needs something to cover the taxes,
*  which I know I'm not supposed to bring up anymore.
*  So you'd have the boat in St.
*  Bart's.
*  I know.
*  I lived there.
*  But you'd have YouTube TV?
*  Yeah.
*  Unless they do some weird thing of like, are you here permanently?
*  Because you just keep clicking.
*  I'm visiting.
*  This would all lead to you disappear.
*  And we do like an eight episode ringer podcast thing about what happened to you.
*  There was a South of France thing where I was looking at something on Zillow,
*  where I was like, I could just have the worst schedule ever
*  and do NBA pods from here.
*  Like at five in the morning?
*  I don't have anything telling me I can't do it.
*  And then I think something came up and I was like, I can't.
*  What was the shortest amount of time where you decided that you were flying somewhere
*  that wasn't in this country and then you were actually going on the plane?
*  All right.
*  This is actually kind of funny because when I flew to Reykjavik in Iceland,
*  the flight from Minneapolis to Reykjavik is like five hours, 445.
*  And I was like, dude, if I meet just some smoke show from Reykjavik, like I could just,
*  it's not that bad a flight.
*  It's two and a half to Minneapolis from LA and then
*  So you could live in Minnesota.
*  You get the timber wars.
*  No, I could live in LA and I could commute through and then I could be a Reykjavik.
*  We split time.
*  You went through this thought process.
*  I just couldn't.
*  It was like you sit in the...
*  I remember when I flew to Greece once, I was like all pumped up and I like turned to the guy next
*  to me. I was like, what do we got like six, seven hours here?
*  Because I was so used to the East Coast Europe thing.
*  The guy's like 11.
*  I went, fuck, like I have not mentally prepared myself for 11.
*  So what was the fastest you've gone on a trip though?
*  Right. So that was the Iceland one.
*  Once I sat down and I saw the thing on the graphic, I'm like 445.
*  Could I, should I look at property?
*  Yeah. And it was all because it wasn't seven hours.
*  It was under five.
*  It was really stupid.
*  I mean, all these things are stupid that I do.
*  San Sebastian applying for a job.
*  Do you tell people when you're like all of a sudden on your way to some country?
*  Are there five people you're like, hey, just FYI, I'm going to be in Spain for a while.
*  No, I actually was in New Zealand hopping on like this prop plane over Milford sound
*  and you had to sign all these waivers.
*  And I was like, I probably should tell somebody.
*  So I remember I forwarded my trust and will to my brother and I was like,
*  Hey, I'm in New Zealand.
*  I was like, did you get that email?
*  And he's like, what the fuck are you doing right now?
*  He's like, are you all right?
*  I was like, no, I'm fine.
*  I'm going to where they fill more of the rings.
*  You were like, so scoot Henderson gets 10%.
*  You get 40%.
*  Five percent to Yoko just so you could buy another horse.
*  I just hope scoot gets a second contract and you won't need any of my money.
*  Last thing.
*  What's your prediction for the Denver nuggets?
*  The season?
*  How many rounds?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know what you're trading unless you just pulled a
*  part of Michael Porter Jr.
*  And you think it's an upgrade.
*  You look at the contracts.
*  It's, it's, it's gotta be Porter.
*  Who's, who's the impactful person that then makes you better?
*  Because Gordon, like I love Gordon on this team so much.
*  I don't know that I would.
*  Actually, there's no version of him I would like as much as this one because of
*  Yoko and the baseline stuff and all that stuff.
*  The other thing is it's harder to make trades now, which I didn't.
*  I'm still kind of figuring out the machinations because we got to get ready for
*  when we start doing fake trades.
*  And about, but it's not even what the penalties are in place.
*  It's the fear of what the next one will do to you.
*  Yeah.
*  But even also just matching the contracts and be like, no, no, you actually can't do that
*  because you're over this apron.
*  So you can only, it's, I didn't get into sports to actually have to figure out
*  fucking math.
*  I got to tell you that much.
*  And it's the most confusing it's ever been.
*  But like, even you look at it and go, well, why wouldn't they trade Michael Porter
*  for Zach Levine?
*  That would be an interesting trade.
*  Right.
*  And it's like, no, you can't cause then you got to give him Zeke Naji.
*  I'm just, it's a hypothetical.
*  Some Porter fans, huh?
*  Jimmy Baller is another one.
*  I think it's a matchup thing.
*  I think some teams still have real like question marks.
*  There's some teams that want to close small all the time.
*  Like I'm noticing more and more where teams will just like match each other with small
*  lineups and like, here we go again.
*  So it depends on the draw, but they're certainly not the favorites, but here's Phoenix who's
*  falling apart again.
*  Well, how many West teams do you really like?
*  Cause for me, it's like assuming check comes back, which we have no idea.
*  Okay.
*  C is the only one I feel great about.
*  Yeah.
*  Dallas is turning it around.
*  They're going to be good, but I don't know if they're
*  locked into as a two seed, but if it were Dallas, Denver,
*  I mean, it also has to see how it looks in March and April, but.
*  I'm trying to think of a single team in the West that would be psyched to see Yokelach.
*  I'm going to say the answer is zero, but okay.
*  C would be, you know, they're just like, take your 40.
*  We'll take out everybody else.
*  We have a way better team than you.
*  And I, I, that'd be a really tough one.
*  So I would have okay.
*  And then I just think it's TBD.
*  I liked Phoenix and we went big on them in the over unders and, you know,
*  Durant's been hurt twice now already.
*  We're not even in December.
*  Yeah.
*  But it might be one of those.
*  One of the things I'm thinking about with this season is just,
*  do we count on these mid thirties guys too much?
*  You know, forget about LeBron the age she's at, but do we even curry 36, Durant
*  and the 2007 draft on and on.
*  And we see like the best case version of them when they're actually playing,
*  but the season's like too fucking hard.
*  Now all these teams are good.
*  The style of play is really hard to play and flying up and down.
*  Then you got four playoff rounds.
*  It's like maybe, you know, somebody like Curry, how realistic is it that he could
*  get through a season like this where he's carrying the burden is carrying.
*  And then when four straight playoff rounds, no way.
*  Look, I want to defend Curry all the time.
*  The second player isn't good enough.
*  I don't even know who it is for a playoff team to get through multiple
*  rounds in this West two years ago or two and a half years ago.
*  They barely got there and they got a lot of luck, but you know, I just wonder if this is
*  the year where it's like Boston, Cleveland, okay.
*  See these young, talented, hungry teams.
*  And it's just, those are going to be the three.
*  I think Cleveland's in the conversation though.
*  I believe in them.
*  I do, but I do think it's going to be tough to close those two bigs.
*  And that's why they're benching Jared Allen down those stretches.
*  And I think that's what it'll look like.
*  And that's probably the best chance to not.
*  I just don't know how you can play three out with two non-shooters in a game in the
*  playoffs in today's league, but I'm not done with Minnesota.
*  Phoenix is a tough gamble.
*  Denver, Denver's in that mix with those.
*  You're not done with Minnesota.
*  No, it's December 4th.
*  I'm done.
*  If this is the roster.
*  I'm not.
*  Who booed?
*  I thought you guys all hated Minnesota.
*  It knocked out last year.
*  A lot of, there's a lot of transplants in Denver bill.
*  I do not like the body language or the ball movement on the Minnesota timber wolves.
*  You know what I want from you?
*  I don't like the dueling banjo is your turn.
*  My turn.
*  I'm out.
*  When we get ready, when we do our first NBA Sunday pod, I want your five favorite
*  body language teams, five favorite bad body language, five favorite body language.
*  Oh, like raving about high fives.
*  Oh my God.
*  I thought Golden State was great last night.
*  Everybody was standing body language.
*  Doctor noticed that.
*  Okay.
*  See, I like when they all do the postgame interview together.
*  Heartwarming.
*  Boston, I think has, has great stuff.
*  Everybody's pulling for each other.
*  You can see, you can tell which teams like each other.
*  It looks like you're already at the segment.
*  Be easy to prep.
*  Hey, Denver, this was great.
*  I'm glad we came.
*  We got an incredible yolkage game.
*  That was the other reason we came.
*  He delivered.
*  He was great to watch a person.
*  What a treasure.
*  I hope you guys appreciate him.
*  We love being here.
*  Any last words?
*  We'll see at the gun.
*  We will not see you at shotgun Willie's.
*  Thank you, Denver.
