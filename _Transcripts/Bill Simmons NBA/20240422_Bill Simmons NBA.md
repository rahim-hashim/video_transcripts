# Jokicâ€™s Place in the Pantheon If He Goes Back-to-Back | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kSjxWTAkcs)
*  I was thinking about this Jokic for your run. This would be year four
*  Of just what an unbelievable playoff performer he's been
*  He's one of the greatest playoff performers in the history of the league, which I don't think gets mentioned that much if not ever
*  2021 22 23 and then first game this year. He's averaging 30 points a game 13 rebounds and eight assists
*  He's shooting he's a 54
*  41 80 percentage guy
*  31.6 PR which is like
*  Levitating above just about anybody. He's point 301 win shares per 48
*  it's just like it's obscene and I was like I wonder if anyone's even close to this in the last like 50 years and went
*  through and
*  the closest I could get
*  LeBron from 15 to 18
*  Average 31 10 and 8 but some of the advanced stuff wasn't as good
*  Jordan from 90 to 93 was 34 points a game 7 and 7 and
*  Then the legendary bird and 84 to 87
*  27 10 and 7 and was almost 50 40 90
*  And then Yanis was the only other one I could find were 19 to 22 is 29 13 and 6
*  Does you know could you get credit for being an unbelievable playoff performer because I don't think he does
*  Not to the level like Lakers fans talking themselves into it. I'm like wait, didn't you guys just see what happened last year?
*  It just happened. It was a year ago people talk about him being like the worst MVP
*  Like what like what what is going on with you guys? Here's here's what I ask you
*  We've had I mean it's hard when you start going top 10 all time, right?
*  Like who are the unassailable top tens in NBA history for you? I'm sure you have these off the top of your head
*  Well, I'm curry it took forever for him to get to the tenth spot for me
*  And it's like basically curry versus Kobe for that spot
*  And I had heading into the season. I had yokage 19th
*  I had him as the third highest guy in the level below the Pantheon if he goes back to back he goes in the Pantheon
*  All right, so it's I think he's against moat at that point
*  It's him versus Moses and Shaq and Akeem and we start arguing about that. That's the territory zone if they if he wins again
*  Okay, cuz this is good. All right, so right now it's it's Jordan. It's magic. It's LeBron
*  Bird it's Bill Russell. It's done cream
*  Duncan will
*  Yeah, so that's it eight
*  Yeah
*  There's Jerry West is in there curry Jerry Jerry West is top ten for you and then you have curry say 10
*  Right just to kind of do this off the top. All right, so if you look at
*  The guys that have been rolling through this generation
*  They're like, okay curry gets in there. I would have no issue with it
*  Obviously, I have curry 10th and I have Durant 16th out of the new guys. I
*  think most people would say I
*  Think Kobe's more popular than Steph. So I think there'd be more people saying you guys should have Kobe over step. Whatever. It's fun
*  It's a really good argument. You could write cuz Kobe had more on BA's
*  He has more points like you could argue this staff run is coming to kind of a close at least from a postseason
*  Standpoint Kobe's postseason resumes better. It's a good argument
*  There's also like the holes that Kobe has in comparison to LeBron where you're like, hey what happened there like Steph has has those two
*  Where that has three of the last five years doesn't win a playoff game, right? One year he played five games
*  So I'm just saying three of the last five. I just hey add in context
*  Hakim I get really defensive about probably more defensive any player in history of like
*  I really don't want to have this guy outside of the top ten. I think he's I'll always say it
*  I think he's the most underrated like superstar that I can think of it and be a history
*  So if those are they like the the ten, all right and save Kobe's your tenth, I'm not gonna argue about it
*  We were in our tactic
*  Kobe is my tenth right now. So curry I've curry 9th Kobe 10th Jerry West 11th
*  I don't know what Jerry did to drop behind those guys, but it happened. Was it a recent podcast interview?
*  Just like you know, I'm not moving down to 11. I don't know what it was. I don't know what he did
*  Could have been Curry's I don't know fourth ring another all-mba. The point that I'm trying to make here is that
*  There's there was a movement of like hey Durant could end up top 10 all time
*  Steph could end up top 10 all time
*  Yanis like what is what is the finished product of Yanis the point that I'm making in reference to yokich is
*  that if yokich gets another one here and
*  He's what year two or three of this five-year window and I think he's also gonna age really well
*  He's probably gonna pass all of these guys like this is the level that he's at
*  So for anybody to arguing of like where he's at in today's game
*  Yeah, I don't even know that that's an argument anymore. That's why I had no issue whatsoever voting firm for MVP
*  I just went like look, I know what the other numbers are
*  I know what the arguments can be if you really want to get in a seating we're separating it by a game here or there
*  I mean go ahead if that's your tiebreaker
*  I think it's a ridiculous tiebreaker, but the control that he has over the game and
*  Then you look at him historically. He has the highest career per in playoff history. Okay, he's ahead of Jordan
*  He's ahead of LeBron
*  Number one the highest like again, there's nobody higher than now granted later on as he ages that can dip at one point
*  I remember Zach Lowe arguing Chris Paul and his death the rings piece that came out like a decade ago
*  And I absolutely loved it because he was like look at Chris Paul's efficiency stuff here all time. He was a top-ten guy
*  He's still I think 14th on this list. Yeah, it gets tough when you get older
*  So yokich may age behind
*  Michael Jordan
*  Yeah
*  There's a good argument to look at this now and say all these other names that we've talked about like being in the absolute
*  top ten list of NBA players
*  Yokich is positioned to surpass these guys because the Durant argument becomes really complicated
*  I think because this is all yokich. This is this is his team the stuff like it's just gonna ding
*  Durant when you're comparing them to the the five other guys
*  He's supposed to go ahead of and unless he gets another one in Phoenix
*  It's gonna be hard for him once he's done to go I'm gonna put Durant ahead of Akim or Steph or some of these other
*  Guys, he's just not gonna pass those guys
*  The spot yokich can get to is in that kind of Duncan bird magic territory
*  That five six seven eight range. I mean, he's got three MVPs in the last four years. He finished second the other year
*  He's getting about to win back-to-back titles. He's well, we don't know that we don't know that
*  I'm saying he's the favorite to do it
*  And it goes back to what we're talking about with them beat. It's in a in a way not gonna
*  it's like the opposite of him be because
*  There's something so insanely durable about him and I feel the same way about Luca actually too the speed they play
*  I just don't see a lot of potential for terrible injuries with those guys
*  Right the way the way they the way they move the way they carry themselves in their bodies
*  It just some guys are just durable. We haven't seen
*  really any yokich injuries
*  that I can remember and
*  He played 79 games this year he's gonna play 20 to 25
*  Playoff games again, and she's gonna come back the next year Duncan was pretty durable too. Some guys are just durable but I
*  Think that's where he ends up and I think he's that good and I think it's justified and the stats back it up
*  And that's why I brought up that four-year. I
*  Think four years is a nice way to look at players because if you have that like a four-year
*  kind of peak
*  Or four-year snapshot that's a long time right it's a presidential term
*  It's it's somebody going to college and graduating a long-ass time if you're that good for that long
*  It's meaningful in a different way. So
