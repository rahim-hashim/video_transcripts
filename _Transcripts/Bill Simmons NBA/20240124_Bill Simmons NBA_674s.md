# Can the Bucks Be Saved This Season? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [January 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=0.0s)]
*  So I waited to take my podcast on Tuesday until a little later because I felt like [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=0.24s)]
*  something was going down today, but I thought it was going to be a trade. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=5.36s)]
*  And then Terry Roger and Kyle Lowry, that trade happens. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  I'm like, oh, okay. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=12.4s)]
*  That's good enough. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  We'll get that going. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=14.0s)]
*  Little Lakers Clippers tonight. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=14.8s)]
*  And then Adrian Griffin gets fired out of nowhere. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=15.92s)]
*  And I'm doing a documentary shoot that I, all of a sudden my phone starts blowing up 43 games. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=21.04s)]
*  And then Kevin O'Connor, Joe Hauser here. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=26.88s)]
*  I went from being like, holy shit, I can't believe they, and then the doc river stuff started. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=31.28s)]
*  And I was like, oh my God, Doc's only been on this podcast five times. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=37.36s)]
*  I love having doc rivers. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=41.12s)]
*  It's been so much fun. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  You're taking doc rivers for me. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  KOC help explain any of this to us. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  I mean, I'm mostly disappointed that doc is going to be ripped away from you. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=50.32s)]
*  He's been great this year. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=53.44s)]
*  He's been great this year. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=54.56s)]
*  It's too bad. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=56.88s)]
*  But look, I think for the bucks that this has been going on a long time with them. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=57.6s)]
*  Like it first started before the season, Terry Stott skips berated. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=62.88s)]
*  He walks away from the team earlier in the season, four games in the bucks. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=66.56s)]
*  Veterans asked the, asked Griffin to change the defensive scheme back to having Brook Lopez and drop. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=70.72s)]
*  They were playing a very aggressive scheme that resembled what the Raptors were doing [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=76.08s)]
*  where Griffin was an assistant in recent years. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=80.4s)]
*  So they go back to dropping with Brook Lopez, but everything else is pretty much the same. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=82.8s)]
*  Giannis and Portis are switching on ball screens more than they ever have. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=87.84s)]
*  They're playing aggressive. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=91.84s)]
*  Their point, their pickup point on ball handlers is higher than it was before. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=93.2s)]
*  And by pulling these, you know, bigger defenders, Giannis, Portis away from the paint, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=97.84s)]
*  they are giving up more offensive rebounds than ever before. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=102.96s)]
*  They're allowing more at-rem chances than ever before. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=106.4s)]
*  And I know like the counter argument to all of the defense. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=108.72s)]
*  Wait, hold on. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=111.6s)]
*  You're not seeing the force through the trees here. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  We saw it in Vegas and we both did podcasts when we were there and we were like, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=116.16s)]
*  something's off with this team. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=121.28s)]
*  It wasn't just the defensive stuff. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=122.8s)]
*  It seemed like Giannis was out and we were sitting there watching it going, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=124.96s)]
*  what's going on? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=130.48s)]
*  Why isn't he in the huddle? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=131.44s)]
*  We talked, Woz and I talked about it that night. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=132.56s)]
*  We were like, something is wrong. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=134.95999999999998s)]
*  What is it? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=136.48s)]
*  So you think it was all the defensive stuff or was it more than that? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=137.28s)]
*  I mean, I think the tactical side of things is what played into the lack of trust and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=139.84s)]
*  belief in him. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=144.24s)]
*  I think for the team, we saw earlier in the year where Giannis or maybe it was Griffin [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=146.32s)]
*  after a game admitted that Giannis changed the play call that he made. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=150.96s)]
*  We saw Giannis early in the season refused to sub out of the game. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=154.32s)]
*  I think early in the year, it's all like tactical driven decisions. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=159.36s)]
*  The system changes that were made that made the team say, wait a minute here. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=163.52s)]
*  Like, what are we doing? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=167.2s)]
*  We were just a dominant defense for five straight years. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=168.48s)]
*  We had no issues allowing at rim chances and an hour or two things changing all of [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  sudden. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=177.2s)]
*  So I think that played into it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  One of the reasons they were a dominant defense was because they had drew holiday on their [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=178.72s)]
*  team and not Damon Lillard house. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=182.72s)]
*  We talked about this when we did over unders. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  It's like you've cool. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=186.32s)]
*  Dame Lillard, good end of the game guy, 25 to 30 points a game. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=187.44s)]
*  Couldn't guard us. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=192.0s)]
*  So are you surprised that it went this bad, this fast, or did you think this was an after [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=193.76000000000002s)]
*  the season thing? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=200.24s)]
*  Well, I do think that Dame probably could guard us. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  I do think that, but well, you just got your hip replaced. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=205.12s)]
*  So maybe [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  and some other parts. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=212.8s)]
*  But look, I will say this. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=214.24s)]
*  When you have the kind of expression of lack of confidence so early on, I mean, KOC was [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=216.32s)]
*  running through the litany of questionable team commitment and Bobby Portis called the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=229.76s)]
*  coach out during the tournament. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=238.4s)]
*  Like after that, like that was December. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=242.0s)]
*  You can't call the brand new coach out. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  So there was definitely something in terms of that relationship between the coach. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=247.6s)]
*  He, he, he, he failed the most important task, the number one task upon arrival. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=253.68s)]
*  Get buy in, get the guys on. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=260.48s)]
*  Well, and then he fires Terri Stotz or Terri Stotz leaves or whatever happened. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=263.04s)]
*  I guess Terri Stotz decided to exit stage right before the season even started. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=267.36s)]
*  And Dame was clearly bummed out about that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=272.16s)]
*  Janice was clearly bummed out about all the Griffin defensive stuff. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=274.24s)]
*  So we didn't even started the season and people are upset. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=277.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=280.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=282.0s)]
*  So here we are. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=282.64s)]
*  Well, here's my take guys. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=284.8s)]
*  I think yet again, we have learned that maybe NBA players, especially NBA players, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=287.76s)]
*  like under 30 years old might not be the best guys to decide who should be on the team and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=292.64s)]
*  who should be coaching it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=298.8s)]
*  Because Janice, they push out coach bud. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=300.64s)]
*  I don't know who was responsible for that, but I don't think you run decisions like that [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=304.8s)]
*  without running it through your superstar. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=310.88s)]
*  And then the Dame trade was the other one where Janice wouldn't sign the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=312.96s)]
*  extension until they did something. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=315.76s)]
*  You had to do something. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=317.76s)]
*  So they do this Dame trade and you look at what Miami gave up for Roger today. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm not saying Roger is better than Dame, but they gave up what? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=323.52s)]
*  25% of what they were ready to give up for Dame. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=326.8s)]
*  They got to keep Hockes. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=329.2s)]
*  They got to keep other first round picks and they end up with Roger, who's going to give them [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=330.32s)]
*  80% of the offensive production at Dame, better defense, and they still have all these other [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  assets to do stuff. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=341.44s)]
*  So I think with Janice, sometimes superstars in the NBA can become too powerful. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=342.4s)]
*  And I wonder like in this case, were they so afraid of losing him that that leads to [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=348.48s)]
*  decision A, decision B, decision C. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=355.28s)]
*  And now they're basically reset budding it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=357.2s)]
*  I don't think you could bring in any coach and I don't think it's going to fix some of [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=359.12s)]
*  that offensive stuff. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=363.84s)]
*  Do you think KOC? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, Dame's been one of the worst defensive players in the league for the last couple [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=365.84s)]
*  of years out of all the starters, right? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=368.4s)]
*  I mean, that's where I disagree though. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=369.92s)]
*  I think with Drew Holliday, if he were still on this team, the Bucks would be worse. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=371.44s)]
*  One of the reasons why they have a record as good as they do is because Janice has dragged [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=375.2s)]
*  them some victories. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=381.03999999999996s)]
*  Dame has made heroic shots and end of games like he did earlier this month with that [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  overtime logo three against the Kings. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=386.4s)]
*  Like those guys Janice and Dame have just overcome some of the issues they've had. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=389.28s)]
*  And so like with. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=394.47999999999996s)]
*  So you would say Dame has too. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=395.52s)]
*  I know they've stolen some games at the end, but I think for the most part, he's been pretty [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=396.96s)]
*  hit or miss. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=401.35999999999996s)]
*  Like he's had a bunch of three for 17s, four for 16s. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=402.08s)]
*  He's gotten lit up by, I mean, Indiana, that's like they have the Milwaukee game circled [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=405.76s)]
*  on their calendar because it's so much fun for Halibur. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=411.35999999999996s)]
*  And so I don't know. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  I feel on the one hand, like I see what you're saying, but on the other hand, it's like, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=415.44s)]
*  all right, well, you do have Janice and he's been healthy the whole year. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=420.0s)]
*  You're probably going to have around this record anyway. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=422.8s)]
*  I just don't think Drew Holliday is solving all of the defensive issues they have. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=424.88s)]
*  I guess he'd help at the point of attack. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=429.84s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=431.6s)]
*  They've struggled with Dame. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=432.48s)]
*  Dame isn't like has never been a stopper. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=434.15999999999997s)]
*  He's not even hustling back on defense enough. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=436.4s)]
*  Malik Beasley is worse than Grayson Allen for that matter. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=438.48s)]
*  And Pat Conantin has not been productive this year. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=442.15999999999997s)]
*  So their point of attack defense is weak, but because their point of attack defense is weak, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=444.64s)]
*  the way they're playing by pulling Janice and Bobby Portis away from the rim, the way they [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=450.15999999999997s)]
*  intended on having Robert, Brooke Lopez away from the rim earlier in the season, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=454.56s)]
*  it has created a situation where they don't have as much size inside to stop that penetration [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=459.03999999999996s)]
*  that's occurring. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=464.8s)]
*  They don't have as much size inside to get defensive rebounds. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=465.68s)]
*  They're worse this year than they've ever been under Bud. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=470.15999999999997s)]
*  So I think for the Bucs, it's all of these things combined. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=472.72s)]
*  And yes, Drew Holliday would help, but he wouldn't be the complete cure for their issues. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=475.76000000000005s)]
*  House, you can't say it's just Drew Holliday though, because it's Drew Holliday. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=482.32000000000005s)]
*  It's Grayson Allen who's been, I wasn't a fan heading into the season, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=485.6s)]
*  but he has been one of the best three point shooters in the league this year, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=489.52000000000004s)]
*  plus the other assets that they gave up, which crippled them. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=492.64000000000004s)]
*  So now they have nothing they can trade. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=495.76000000000005s)]
*  They can't really move any of their first round picks. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=497.6s)]
*  So I guess the question is, House, would you still do the Dame trade or would you rather [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=500.16s)]
*  have Drew Holliday, Grayson Allen, whatever else they gave up all the picks and the flexibility [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=506.64000000000004s)]
*  to maybe go get Terry Roger to maybe get some of the pieces that are going to be available [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=511.20000000000005s)]
*  in February? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=516.24s)]
*  Because I was on the record when it happened. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=516.88s)]
*  I didn't like the Dame trade and I thought people were really underestimating his defense. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=519.36s)]
*  So where do you stand 43 games in? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=526.1600000000001s)]
*  I like the Dame trade and I think it still has a very good chance of proving out. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=528.96s)]
*  We are going to have that referendum now, right? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=535.5200000000001s)]
*  We're 41 games in, whatever, 43 games in. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=538.4000000000001s)]
*  Now we're going to see because to KOC's point, this team lost a core concept, a core identity. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=542.64s)]
*  They're 25th in opponent points in the paint this season. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=551.44s)]
*  They were 13th in that category last year. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=555.2800000000001s)]
*  They're 23rd in opponent fast break points. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=557.68s)]
*  They were eighth in that category last year. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=560.88s)]
*  So teams, they can't protect the paint and teams are getting out and running on them. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=563.5999999999999s)]
*  And that is a function of scheme. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=567.92s)]
*  There is some kind of mismatch going on there between the personnel that they have and what [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=571.8399999999999s)]
*  Griffin was trying to do. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=577.5999999999999s)]
*  So we expect that Doc will come in, be a stabilizing influence and figure out a way. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=579.4399999999999s)]
*  If it's Doc, sure, we'll keep using that caveat until it becomes Doc. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=585.52s)]
*  But look, we're going to figure it out. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=590.0799999999999s)]
*  The thing that we knew for sure, and I do give the Bucs credit for this, this team was going [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=593.8399999999999s)]
*  nowhere in the playoffs. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=598.7199999999999s)]
*  This version playing the way that they were playing, we didn't need to see any more games. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=600.0799999999999s)]
*  And they didn't either. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=604.4799999999999s)]
*  It's why they were going to practices. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=605.76s)]
*  You know, the report was that Mark Spears was saying, you know, the front office was [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=607.5999999999999s)]
*  showing up at practice the last two weeks to what Chris Haynes, Chris Haynes, it was [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=612.48s)]
*  Chris Haynes on the floor watching Griffin conduct these practices. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=616.96s)]
*  They're like, you know what? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=621.2s)]
*  We're not going anywhere in the playoffs with this iteration. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=622.32s)]
*  We must do something different. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=625.52s)]
*  I still wonder if they, if there isn't, they need a body. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=626.72s)]
*  They still need a body to my way of thinking. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=630.96s)]
*  And it's got to be like, there's this new rule that with the signing buyout guys, that [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=633.6s)]
*  if they make over 12.4 million, you can't, if you're over those aprons, you can't even [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=638.0s)]
*  sign him know about that rule today. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=642.56s)]
*  But so Kelly Olinick's at like 12.2. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=644.16s)]
*  He's kind of, it should almost call it the Kelly Olinick, whatever house you say all [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=646.7199999999999s)]
*  that Milwaukee Bucs on Fandle right now plus two 20 to win the conference. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=651.28s)]
*  Are you taking that? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=658.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=659.1999999999999s)]
*  Thumbs down. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=659.4399999999999s)]
*  That's what I thought. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acCpNd1ZQVU&t=660.0799999999999s)]
