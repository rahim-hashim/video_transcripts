# Bill Simmonsâ€™s Early NBA Power Poll | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [November 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5nm3YA4T9Y)
*  All right. I'm gonna throw an NBA power pole at you.
*  I'm not sure I'm going to do this every Tuesday, but I definitely want to do this some Tuesdays.
*  I'm going to go through all 30 teams as fast as possible and I'm going to throw things out
*  that I feel like are important when necessary. Potshots, important comments, things I've noticed,
*  some fake trades. You know, you've known me for a while. It's going to be all the typical stuff.
*  Going backwards from 30 to one, I'll give you the groups as we go. The first group is called the
*  Dreggs. That's Washington number 30. They are 30th in defense and the only reason they're 30th in
*  defense is because we only have 30 teams. I actually think there's some way they could have
*  been 36th in defense. They're the only team in the entire league that I do not want to watch on league
*  pass for any reason at all. They're one in five, 15.6 point differential against them. Shoot this
*  team into the sun. I cannot believe House thought this team was going to go over 24 wins. They might
*  not go over 14 wins. They're awful. I never want them on my TV. Next group, probably the lottery.
*  I say probably, but I'm going to zip through these teams and then go back to somebody. 29 Utah,
*  28 Portland, 27 Detroit, 26 San Antonio, 25 Charlotte, who is way more fun than I expected
*  they would be to watch, and 24 Chicago. It just feels like the lottery is in the future for all
*  these teams. I want to talk about San Antonio really quick. Three and four, kind of a sneaky,
*  tough schedule. They played Phoenix twice, the Clippers, Dallas, that goofy Indiana team, Houston
*  and Toronto. They're minus 8.6 point differential because they've gotten blown out a couple of times
*  and they're 29th on defense, which I was surprised by per a hundred possessions. The thing that I
*  wanted to point out here, because this one vignama thing is super important. This is the best teenager
*  that's come into the league, at least since LeBron. We can debate LeBron, I think in year two,
*  for two months at least was a teenager when he was putting up 27, seven and seven when he started his
*  27, seven, seven cycle. Wembe might be the best teenager I've ever seen. They're starting Jeremy
*  Sohan at point guard and Pop's been transparent about this. No, no, you know, we know we're going
*  to take some lumps. We're trying to figure this out. I went to the game when they played the
*  Clippers. I talked about it in a previous pod and it was just an absolute debacle watching poor Sohan
*  try to like run the offense, bring the ball up. Now we're seeing teams starting to pressure them
*  because he's not a point guard. He's a small forward. There's crazy stats now. Trey Jones,
*  just by being on this team and not being Jeremy Sohan is now like one of the best advanced metrics
*  point guards of all time. Right now he's, his per 100 on-off is plus 28.3 because Sohan is
*  minus 22.7. That's how, that's how disparate the two things are. And which brings me to my point, like
*  this is too important. You have the best teenager maybe ever. You have one of the best league pass
*  players already in the entire league in Wembe. I've no idea how long he's going to stay healthy.
*  Knock on wood, hear me knock really loud. They need one more point guard. TJ McConnell is on
*  Indiana and they have Halliburton who's averaging a 24-12. He's awesome. They have Nemahard who's
*  great as a backup. McConnell's like, he's 13 minutes a game. He's clearly a trade piece for them.
*  Just go get him. Like I'm not saying San Antonio has to make the playoffs, but they need to be
*  entertaining and Wembe needs to play with point guards. Like he clearly needs just like to play
*  off people, high screens, all that stuff. They need one more point guard. TJ McConnell is my choice.
*  They have all their own firsts. They're not going to trade those obviously, but they have some goofy
*  picks. Like they have Charlotte's top 14 protected first. They have a pretty good Chicago first that
*  I wouldn't give up. They have a first swap with Boston. Like there's ways to do this. I would just
*  put that Charlotte pick next year on the table and just grab them because you guys hit the lottery
*  literally with Wembe Yama. Like literally hit the lottery. You hit the lottery and you hit the
*  lottery. Get the dude two point guards. We're not asking for much here. I want to watch this guy.
*  I want to enjoy him play basketball. All right. Next section is panic time. Number 23, Memphis,
*  they're one in six. They finally got off the Schneid and number 22 Sacramento who lost twice
*  to Houston in three days by 18 and 25. No Darren Fox for either game.
*  Panic time in this respect. I know we're six games in the season, seven games in the season,
*  but the West is one of those things where you're going to look up and the car is left.
*  The car has left the driveway and your family is gone. You're going to be basically Kevin at home
*  alone if you don't get your shit together. And I don't even want to be two games under 500 in the
*  West. That's how deep and good the West is. So when you're one in six, like all of a sudden two and 12,
*  two and 13 Sacramento could all of a sudden be three and nine. I would just be nervous
*  constantly. This is not like last year when the Lakers started out two and 10 and ended up making
*  the playoffs. Nobody is doing that this year. The cutoff line is going to be four to six wins.
*  Memphis looks, they just can't score. And I think it's going to be really, we talked about this
*  Verna last week. It's going to be really hard for them to crawl back and be at least like 11 and 14,
*  something like that by the time John comes back. The Sacramento thing, we predicted this when we
*  did the over under preview, like the conference is way better and they stayed basically the same.
*  And now Fox has hurt. So it can take Fox going out for 10 games and all of a sudden you're not
*  even in the playing game. I would just be nervous. So it's both of those tapes. Again, it's early.
*  Next group, friskier than we hoped. We have number 21 Brooklyn, Ben Simmons averaging almost 11
*  rebounds and seven assists a game. And yet you can't play him at crunch time. Bizarre. Number 20 or
*  Orlando. Number 19 Houston, number 18, Indiana and number 17 Toronto. Just quickly on Houston,
*  a delightful league pass team. I had no idea. It's like being at a buffet dinner and somebody brings
*  like some, have you ever had a fried oyster? It's like, great, I'll try that. And then it's delicious.
*  They play hard. I like watching them and I did not expect a Shen Gun to be a potential all-star,
*  but that's where we are. They're three and three. Again, they beat Sacramento twice. We'll see. But
*  Orlando at number 20, I'm going to, every time I do this, I'm going to have a BS all-star of the
*  week. And it's going to be, I used to do this when I, when I wrote my column back in the day,
*  I used to call them the Bill Simmons all-stars, just people that I just liked for whatever reason.
*  I love Jalen Suggs. I don't really know fully what he is. He tries harder than everybody on every
*  other team. He really gives a shit. He feels additive in all these different ways. And,
*  and yet at the same time, he'll absolutely like airball a three and one of the biggest moments
*  of the game. But that guy cares. I watched a game where he got this hustle rebound.
*  I can't remember who they, they lost in the buzzer, get this hustle rebound and dribble back out and
*  took a three and missed it and put his jersey over his head for like the next minute and a half. I
*  actually think he might've been crying. He was so upset they lost. He is the most competitive
*  random guy in the league. I love Jalen Suggs. Oh, as Suru said, it's a Laker game. I love Jalen
*  Suggs. I don't know what he is. He might just end up being like a seventh man on a championship
*  team at some point. He's going to have a moment on a good team. I don't know if Orlando is going to
*  be the team, but it's going to happen for that dude. I also really like Anthony Black more than
*  I thought, but we'll see. It's early for this team. Palo hasn't gotten going. Some other four and
*  three. We'll see when the schedule gets harder. Toronto at number 17, just the Lakers miss Schroeder
*  and I like what Schroeder is doing in Toronto. There's three and four, but they easily could be
*  five and two. I've been watching them cause I have their over under I bet on. And, and I like where
*  Toronto is at. I think they're better than they were last year. I think they're at least a playing
*  team. Number 18, Indiana though. So they're second in offensive rating and 25th in defense. In the
*  25th, I was actually surprised it wasn't worse. They can't guard anybody. They're shooting 43s
*  a game. Their top six guys are all over 40% three, three point shooting. They're kind of like the
*  eighties nuggets, but with threes and they just play with a certain pace. And some days it's going
*  to be bad. Like the Celtics put 155 points on them and it probably could have been 160 if they'd made
*  some shots. Hal Burton special, he's a 24 12 this year, but the, the crazy thing about their offense
*  is that Mathern's been terrible. And Mathern was a guy that they were like, this is going to be our
*  guy. He's making a leap. We're going to trade buddy healed. We've got to give the car keys to Mathern
*  that spot. And he's been bad and their offense has still been pretty good. This is a team that
*  anytime you see them, I don't know if you bet basketball, but if they're like plus 11 plus 12,
*  I guess they could beat anybody any night. I'm just telling you, I'm not saying they're going to win
*  a round in the playoffs, but just night to night that's a team like that. They could just go 22
*  for 45 from three, make some shots and Hal Burton. Um, they actually should be five and two. Hal
*  Burton blew the last possession against Charlotte the other night, but I've enjoyed watching them.
*  I've watched them insane amount of basketball, but all right, next group, the wild cards.
*  I don't have a lot to say about these teams, but we'll go in order. Number 16, New Orleans,
*  just seem jinxed. I'll come back to them in a second. Number 15, Cleveland. I want to see them
*  with Garland and just, I want to watch them for a couple of weeks. I'm, I like the streus edition,
*  but we'll see the Knicks there three and four nice win against the Quippers. The Randall thing
*  continues to be nuts. Now he's taking out guys in the other team. Quippers 13, just trade for
*  Harden. We talked about the Knicks and Quippers last week. Uh, look, the Quippers, they played one
*  game and they got killed by the Knicks. They're worse. I told you that last week, still feel that
*  way. Guess what they can't do now. Uh, any transition stuff, the Knicks 26, 26 to six and
*  fast break points last night, uh, rebounding. They got out read, uh, rebounded by 17 by the Knicks.
*  Harden just bring so many things that you don't want in a starting five, but then he brings like
*  the great passing and the scoring and he can have the ball at the time, but they don't need anyone
*  to have the ball at the time. Cause they have all these other guys who need the ball. I just don't
*  like the trade. I continue to not like it and I don't understand it. I actually liked the team
*  they had before they made the trade. So congrats again, Quippers. Number 12, Miami, 28th offensively.
*  Kind of feels worse when you watch them. They, they, uh, you know, they haven't had their full
*  team for like a couple of weeks. Um, I'm not going to judge them at all until December and I'm not
*  going to judge Dallas either Dallas. I have a number 11, there's six in one fourth and offense.
*  Um, they've had a really easy schedule. So that's why, like, let's see what happens. Like they lot
*  their one losses to Denver. Let's see what happens when they play some, some tough teams all in a
*  row and have one of those four games and six nights were three on the road, one of those situations,
*  but they are in better shape than they were last year. And you look at, um, the grant Williams
*  piece, which, you know, I'm not spiteful when I watch my old players. Um, I'm rooting for
*  grant Williams. It's like seeing somebody you dated that you still have a good relationship with. It
*  was nice to see him do well for them. The Derek Lively seems like they have something. We talked
*  about him last week, but he's at least like a rim runner in that kind of Nick Clarkson world, but
*  maybe, uh, maybe a little more violent, Al Youper, a little, little young Clint Capelli.
*  The, the Kyrie thing is the piece that I'm really interested in this. He finally had a good game
*  last night, but for the season, 24% three point, uh, shooting 3.8 free throws a game, which are
*  always the two numbers to look at with Kyrie. What's he shooting threes is he getting in the line.
*  And so far it's been neither, but he seems happy. Like when you watch them, they've been a
*  surprisingly pleasant watch and he seems like in a good spot. So I don't want to jinx it because
*  as annoying as he's been over the years and you know, my stance on Kyrie, I just don't trust them.
*  And I just feel like a seven year track record of imploding kind of has to start to mean something
*  after a while, but it's fun to watch him play basketball. And it does feel like he's got a
*  specific spot on this team. They don't have to rely on him too much. It's very similar to where he was
*  in 15 and 16 and 17 with the calves, where he could kind of float in and out like a cat with
*  LeBron. It's like, I'm feeling it. Oh, all right. Let's give Kyrie the ball. Um, the shooting going
*  down though, it's a small sample size, but they also haven't been playing tough teams yet. And
*  I'm just some monitoring that because with guards, it can kind of sometimes go sideways pretty fast
*  and you don't realize it happened until after it happened. Uh, just quickly going backwards to number
*  16 New Orleans, cause they lost Ingram, they lost McCollum already. And they have, uh, this Hawkins
*  they drafted that, um, everybody liked coming out of the draft, but he's the fact that he can play
*  right away has actually kind of saved them a little bit. I just, we, I still feel like we need to do
*  some sort of ceremony or, or, or something with them. Like we need the people from the conjuring
*  to just do something with New Orleans basketball. It just shouldn't be this bad every year. Your
*  team shouldn't have two, three major injuries every year. You should have good luck at some point.
*  And this goes back to the seventies. Like you remember they, when they moved, when they became
*  the new Orleans jazz, um, their first like major, major giant trade was for Gail Goodrich with the
*  Lakers. They had to give up two first rounders and he immediately like blew out his Achilles. He played
*  like, I'm going to say less than a season. And one of the picks turned out to be magic Johnson.
*  So that's where we started with New Orleans and it's been awful ever since. Like there, nothing
*  good has happened in this team other than they've won a couple of lotteries, but even the lotteries
*  they won, they won the Anthony Davis when they were in Charlotte before they got to New Orleans,
*  they bring him to New Orleans and he wants to leave. And then they win the Zion thing,
*  which, um, seemed like the luckiest thing that ever happened to them. And meanwhile,
*  we're still waiting for him to play two straight months. So conjuring people, something, we need
*  something to happen with that too. All right. The top 10, we're at a good pace right now.
*  Where are we at? Yeah, feeling good. This is working.
*  Young and hungry is the next thing we got Oklahoma city at number 10 and Atlanta at number nine. If
*  you remember Atlanta was one of the, these are the two teams I was going nuts for before the
*  season for the rubber unders. I love the Atlanta over under. I love the New Orleans over. Um,
*  and I like what I've seen from both. Okay. C's four and three. Atlanta's four and three.
*  Atlanta sixth in offense. And that's notable because Trey Young has sucked again shooting
*  mice. He's 28% from three last year's 33% from three. This might not be happening.
*  The next Steph Curry thing, like what age, what age does he have to hit where we have to go?
*  All right. He's not the next step. Great. Because I think I hit that age last year
*  at age when I was age 53. I think I hit that for Trey. Um, they killed Minnesota, which is notable.
*  We'll talk about Minnesota in a second, but, um, they really, I watched that game. They really,
*  really, really handled them. I like this Atlanta team. And I think there's a path for them to be a
*  three or four seed if, um, if Trey can get going and then okay. C trade for a bigger Eddie,
*  you're a guy short, like stop. You guys have a chance to be like a 50 win team. What are you doing?
*  I want to see what's going on with Josh Giddy in about two weeks, whether it looks different than
*  it has for the first couple of weeks here. I don't like he's not going on the free throw line
*  at all. 1.3 a game, 26% three point shooting, which we knew he can't shoot threes, but, um,
*  there's also like the Chet piece of it seems like it's thrown them off and that I've watched games
*  where they've taken them out at crunch time. Um, it's, I just thought he would make a leap
*  and it feels like he's gone backwards. And it's not just statistically, just eye test wise. They
*  seem very comfortable when he's not out there. And, uh, I'm just monitoring that because,
*  you know, they have 10 million first round picks and a hundred million second round picks. And if
*  they ever really wanted to make a move, I don't know if they put Giddy on the table. Cause I think
*  he's like 17 years old. I know that's impossible, but I think I drafted him as 14, but, um, that
*  seems like the most expendable guy there. J-dub chat, SGA door. Like this team is incredibly fun
*  to watch. Um, but Giddy's been the disappointment. So monitoring that. All right. Top eight. All
*  right. The number 18 gets its own group. The enigma Milwaukee 27th in defense. And they were,
*  I think 29th just behind the wizards until the last game, their 30th in transition defense,
*  according to cleaning the glass. And it feels worse. They just seem slow. I'm going to continue
*  to say it. They seem slow and Giannis is like shot out of a cannon. They win the game the other
*  night against Brooklyn because of Giannis. Like he just single-handedly won the game. Camp Thomas
*  put up 43 on them. Camp Thomas. They didn't have anybody to guard them. And this is what I was
*  telling you all summer. And I was telling him before the season, like guards are going to kill
*  this team. We're already seeing it and they just look slow. And I'm just not sure they're better
*  than they were last year. I really like, if you, if they had just not made the damn trade, kept
*  those picks and just hired Nick nurse instead of Griffin, who, you know, Griffin loses his top
*  assistant for the season, red flag. He tries this weird defense, the first four games or people
*  swarming around and they're just giving up fast break layups left and right and easy transition
*  stuff. And now they're trying like a drop defense, but I just wonder what ha is there an alternate
*  universe where they just hired Nick nurse and keep drew. They're probably the best team in the league
*  or one of the top three interesting piece with them. Second in free throw rate because of Dame,
*  cause Dame still get in the line 10 times a game. He's not shooting that well yet. 40%,
*  33% from three and can't guard anybody. But, um, I'm not crossing them off cause he,
*  honest is out of his mind. So we'll see, we'll see how they, we'll see Dame gets comfortable
*  and all that stuff, not crossing them off, but it's hard for me to imagine a team that is this
*  slow and plays defense like this is going to be heard from, from four straight rounds in the
*  playoff. I'll just say it next category too soon to say Phoenix. They're three and four Lakers are
*  three and four. I don't have a lot to say about these guys other than, uh, we haven't seen Phoenix
*  with their full team yet. Katie's on pace for 2,900 minutes. Good luck. I mentioned last week, Davis
*  was playing 40 plus minutes a game. We had a good laugh. Guess who heard his groin last night,
*  Anthony Davis. Um, there's a too many guys possibility with the Lakers too. Like they
*  just might assign too many dudes and somehow they still don't have somebody better than cam
*  Reddish to take the biggest shot of, uh, of the Miami game. But this team not counting Mount
*  LeBron looks great. I mean, LeBron, I gotta say LeBron might look better than he did last year
*  and they have just tradable stuff like the Rui contract, Russell, all the stuff that they can
*  start thinking about in December top five. This guy's got their own category, the sleeper,
*  Minnesota. Watch them beat my team in overtime last night. I told my dad, this was probably
*  going to happen because we didn't have Derek white Celtics still undefeated with that. Derek
*  white, by the way, but, uh, Minnesota is foreign to their first in defense and they've beaten
*  Boston and Denver already. And I think it's real. I really do. I think it's real. They're, they're
*  just big and hard to play. And they have two guys who can defend on the wings. McDaniel's was
*  awesome last night against the Celtics against Tatum and Brown. And when Edwards wants to play
*  defense, which, um, he's never bad, but I'm saying when he wants to dial it up, like he did in that
*  one possession gets Tatum, I was saying five fouls still shut down Tatum. Um, they're just a,
*  an absolute bitch to play if they're getting anything from Conley. Now there's been nights
*  like Atlanta, Atlanta beat them and Conley had a bad game and got beaten up by Marin Young, but
*  I've watched a lot of them this year and I've been kind of like quietly bedding them too.
*  Um, they're plus 8.2 point differential. I think that's real. They're only 19th offense,
*  um, offensive rating. And the reason is cause towns who has good plus minus stats,
*  it's not like when he's out there, it's bad for them, but he's averaging 16 and nine this year,
*  38% shooting 24% from three. And if you watched the Celtic game last night, uh, he was the, one of
*  the only reasons the Celtics were in the game. I mean, they were guarding when we drew holiday
*  in the overtime. It was embarrassing for him. Um, it seems like their best lineup might be go bear
*  Naz read McDaniel's Conley and Edwards. I don't know if they want to admit that yet, but towns
*  both feels expendable beam to me, but also feels like one of the reasons they're really good
*  because they always have these two big guys and they're just have a lot of size all over the
*  place, but they also have the ability to guard wings. And, uh, this team is better than I thought
*  they're going to be. And I'm taking them seriously. Like, like I have only two West teams above them,
*  Denver and Golden state. And it's too early to say they're definitively ahead of the Lakers and
*  Phoenix, but they're one of the five best teams in the West. Like this is where we are. This is real.
*  Edwards, what he did last night. Now, of course, Joe Missoula Celtics get a stop, 10 seconds left
*  and no time out. And Jay would take some 26 foot three that misses. We go in overtime.
*  Anthony Edwards, who is one of the reasons the Celtics were able to get it to overtime because
*  he was making just terrible decisions to regulation, but this is what he does. All of a sudden it's hot.
*  All of a sudden he feels it and you know when it's happening. Well, everyone knows, but Joe
*  Missoula, cause he didn't call timeout the entire overtime as aunt is just torching us and going
*  nuts and feeding off the crowd. You know what helps a timeout Minnesota is really good.
*  I'm signing, I'm signing that in pen. Minnesota is good in pen, not pencil top four, the contenders.
*  I got Philly and Golden state here. Number four, number three. I love where Philly's at. They
*  survived all the hard and stuff. They survived some possible and B drama. I didn't like the way
*  he looked opening night. I liked the way he looks now. He seems engaged. Uh, they're more fun to
*  watch the ball moves. The Nick nurse thing has, has, uh, has been as predicted at least early on
*  the number one in offensive rating, seventh in defense and more importantly than anything else,
*  and beat is, is going now they get Covington and they get platoon. They actually have some size to
*  throw at the Celtics and they're playing the Celtics on Wednesday night. And that's going to
*  be an interesting matchup because why it'll be back. I still think the Celtics have major advantages
*  in the back court and they're going to have, um, some people to throw it and beat, but we'll see
*  what happens to them. Be poor Zingas. Number three, Golden state, seventh offense, 13th defense for
*  ratings. They're six and two, and they've had some, some good road wins, which they weren't
*  having last year. Some good end of the game wins, which wasn't necessarily happened last year.
*  And, uh, the chemistry, which they can't stop talking about. It's like enough. How bad are
*  you going to make Jordan pool feel like he did get punched in the face by Draymond to start last
*  season? I'm not, I'm, I refuse to believe he's the Ebola virus and Draymond, like I respect Draymond.
*  I like Draymond. I've enjoyed watching him and I think he's actually been a really underrated
*  basketball player. Like maybe ease up on the pool stuff. Like pools, not saying anything. He's not
*  fighting back. Um, we get it. We know how you feel. I just don't think you need to comment on the
*  chemistry anymore. It just feels, it's starting to feel mean. It's like when Steven A keeps going
*  after max and taking shots at max, it's like, w you won. Why are you, why are you still talking
*  about this? You already won one point on golden state. Chris Paul has been such a massive win for
*  them. I think his assist turnover ratio is 62 and six right now, but you know, Steve Kerr, all he
*  cares about is no turnovers, protect the boards. Those are like his two favorite things. And the
*  team was too sloppy the last couple of years. Chris Paul comes in now, they have no turnovers
*  with the second unit. He just runs a professional thing. This is what he does. And I think the trade
*  has been spectacular for them. We'll see if he could stay healthy. Number two, Boston,
*  still undefeated with Derek White, as I mentioned, um, third offensive rating, second defensive
*  rating, 155 points against Indiana, which was one of the most incredible things I've ever seen
*  for in a random basketball game. That meant nothing. There's still some Jaylen Brown stuff
*  that I'm now I'm monitoring. Like why are, why are we ISOing you for the last shot of the game
*  in Minnesota and why didn't Joe Mazzola call time out so we can set up a better play? Um,
*  Jaylen's good. He's one of the best 30, 35 guys in the league. Do I want him taking
*  the ISO hero ball top of the key shot on the road against a really good Minnesota team? I don't.
*  I don't. Does Jaylen feel like he, because of the contract, he's now allowed to do that,
*  or can we go back to Tatum and, you know, they, if White's out there, maybe he has the ball up in
*  the game, but, uh, I'm just monitoring. There's been some hero ball stuff that I haven't loved,
*  but hard to complain when you're six and one and you look great. See how they do against Philly.
*  Denver seven to one is my last one. Um, the bench thing, the bench experiment worked out great.
*  Murray's hurt. It's got the hammy thing. Monitoring that don't like hammy injuries.
*  Take your time. Jamal Murray. You got Yokoj on your team. Yokoj is 28, 13 and eight.
*  Last time he played the best game I've seen anyone play all season against New Orleans. He
*  just completely demolished him. I had a friend, a friend texts me Burr Duncan, meaning hybrid of
*  Bird and Duncan. I thought that was perfect for the season. 63% shooting 39% on threes and 75%
*  free throw shooting. There's like a faint chance he could be in the 60, 40, 80 club this year.
*  And that won't even be the most incredible statistical achievement. This is still the,
*  Denver is still the best team. Uh, if they're healthy, I think they're going to win the title
*  again. I picked Denver over Boston for the season. Nothing I have seen in the first two plus weeks
*  has made me change that opinion. So that's my power pole. Denver's number one. And then I'm
*  also going to have Adam Silver in the power pole. I'm just going to go thumbs up or thumbs down.
*  He's going to close each one. Um, this week, Adam Silver, there was a story. He took responsibility
*  for the all-star game now being bad. And he said it was, he's talked to the players and it's his
*  fault because they, uh, they too much pregame stuff. The half time's too long. The players
*  can't get in the flow. They're asking too much from the players. The day of the game. When did
*  Adam Silver turn into like a soccer mom? Like the all-star game has sucked for the entire century.
*  There's been no point there in the 21st century where people were like the all-star game's awesome
*  and he wasn't the commissioner for the first 12 years. So now it's your fault. The all-star game
*  sucks. Stop doing stuff like this. Adam Silver. Like I, I gotta say, I kind of miss Stern. I just
*  don't feel like Stern would have been like the all-star games, my fault. I'm sorry guys. I'll
*  make the half time shorter. Like the all-star game is the players fault because they don't give a
*  shit about it. And it's embarrassing and it's their fault. It's not your fault. Adam Silver.
*  I'm going to put my Robin Williams beard on. It's not your fault. It's not your fault. Anyway,
*  thumbs down for Adam Silver this week. Come on. Be the commissioner. Do your thing.
*  Start worrying about how teams have too many timeouts and the instant replay reviews are
*  too long. Don't worry about your culpability in the all-star game. Be a bet.
