# Jokic and the Nuggets Force Game 7 Against OKC With Rob Mahoney | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs)
*  We get one more Yoke-age game. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=0.0s)]
*  We do. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1.6600000000000001s)]
*  We get OKC versus Denver, which has been an absolutely awesome, awesome series. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=2.38s)]
*  I felt myself getting sad in the first half when OKC started to pull away. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=8.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh man, what a journey this has been with Yoke-age with this weird [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  team and his teammates that are either hurt or they don't show up, then they're [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=17.06s)]
*  good again, then they're not good. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=21.1s)]
*  And he's the one constant. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=22.62s)]
*  And I guess this is how it's going to end. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=24.02s)]
*  And then it flips. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=26.42s)]
*  It's a borderline Strother game, but not really. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=27.3s)]
*  There's some Murray in there. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=29.64s)]
*  There's some Yoke-age. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=30.520000000000003s)]
*  There are some heroes. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=31.96s)]
*  Russell Westbrook, not a hero. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=33.800000000000004s)]
*  No, no. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=35.08s)]
*  I think we can give Julian Strother credit for this one as the Julian Strother game. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=36.04s)]
*  You're going Strother game? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=40.96s)]
*  Because yesterday was clearly the Luke Cornett game. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=42.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  Maybe not quite that extreme, but the desperation for Denver and, you know, we [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  saw this in game five, they just needed somebody who could hit a couple of shots [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=49.28s)]
*  and they would have probably pulled out that game or at least made it even more [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=53.160000000000004s)]
*  competitive. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  Him coming up with basically a solo run in the most competitive, tensest part of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=56.86s)]
*  this game just cannot be overstated, the importance of that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=61.9s)]
*  And as you're saying, Russell Westbrook did have the kind of performance where [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=65.94s)]
*  he almost lost this game. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=69.66s)]
*  Like he played poorly enough for extended stretches that it legitimately swung the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=71.78s)]
*  momentum of it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=75.94s)]
*  And if Denver had to stretch his minutes or his importance even more because [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=76.94s)]
*  Julian Strother wasn't playing well enough, because Michael Porter Jr. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=80.78s)]
*  didn't hit a couple of shots, could be having a, could be a very different mood [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=83.5s)]
*  right now for this pod. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=87.4s)]
*  Well, it's funny. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=88.76s)]
*  Strother was basically the bizarro Westbrook. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=89.44s)]
*  Westbrook in the first half felt like he swung the game. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=92.32s)]
*  At one point I looked, he had played, this is in the second half, he'd played [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  seven minutes, he was minus 14 and it felt worse. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=98.8s)]
*  Strother came in and it felt like he played seven minutes and he was like plus [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=101.76s)]
*  84. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=104.68s)]
*  But so it all balanced out. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=106.48s)]
*  But this is the problem with Denver. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=108.12s)]
*  You get past the top three and I have no idea who's showing up. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=110.89999999999999s)]
*  Like game five, it was basically those three guys and that was it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=115.89999999999999s)]
*  And Brown has been, I think really good in the playoffs has been a little shakier [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=119.22s)]
*  offensive with the series, but you just don't know what you're getting. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=122.74s)]
*  So Strother, do I trust he's going to do that in OKC in game seven? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=126.94s)]
*  I don't, but weirdly OKC has the same issue where they're dying for somebody to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=130.18s)]
*  have a little three minute run, right? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=135.9s)]
*  They don't know. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=138.16s)]
*  It was Isaiah Jobe for a while, but it feels like he's kind of gotten nudged out. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=139.0s)]
*  And weirdly sometimes it can be Caruso just kind of as a two way guy. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=143.39999999999998s)]
*  For sure. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=148.2s)]
*  But they're not getting that wild card. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=148.72s)]
*  So so much is on SGA and Jalen Williams and then Jalen Williams stunk tonight. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=150.6s)]
*  Again. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=154.83999999999997s)]
*  I would even set it up differently where it's like if JDub isn't performing, then [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  you now need three wild card players to do well. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=159.6s)]
*  So yeah, you get a good Kacen Wallace stretch in the second quarter. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=162.16s)]
*  You're getting some good Alex Caruso minutes, but like when it comes down to it, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  not enough guys can hit shots. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=168.72s)]
*  You know, you don't get the same like Lou Dort streak. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=169.95999999999998s)]
*  You don't have the same like Chet cashing in on his three. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  Like enough of those plays have to swing in your favor to win a game like this. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=175.23999999999998s)]
*  And JDub just straight up for a player of his caliber, an all NBA caliber guy in the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=179.55999999999997s)]
*  regular season, wasn't good enough to win this game. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=183.95999999999998s)]
*  And that that happens sometimes. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=186.67999999999998s)]
*  It certainly happens with players who are as young as he is, but it's a reality of [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=187.83999999999997s)]
*  Oklahoma City situation. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  That was the number one thing we were worried about with OKC in the playoffs. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=192.88s)]
*  Yep. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=195.72s)]
*  Is your second guy ready yet? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=196.44s)]
*  You know, and you go through the history of the league and the second guy has to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=197.94s)]
*  be a little more consistent than he's been, but, um, I, there's so many ways to [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=201.85999999999999s)]
*  go here. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=207.42s)]
*  Do you think less at OKC because it's taken seven games to beat this pretty [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=209.29999999999998s)]
*  flawed Denver team that's built around one transcendent, one of the great playoff [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=214.38s)]
*  players of all time at this point? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=218.82s)]
*  Or so that's door a door B. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=220.98s)]
*  These are the two best teams in the league. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=225.54s)]
*  And if OKC gets through this, we're smooth sailing after this. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=228.22s)]
*  I mean, I don't think it's either of those doors. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=232.5s)]
*  I mean, give me a door C. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=234.26s)]
*  I mean, door C the nuggets are really good. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=235.82s)]
*  And yes, they have question marks beyond the top three or four guys, but those top [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=238.7s)]
*  three or four know what they're doing, know how to play together, know how to find [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=242.38s)]
*  like all of the inroads to playoff success. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=246.04s)]
*  And it's like, this feels like a very natural graduation point for Oklahoma [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=248.62s)]
*  City. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=252.3s)]
*  Like they're either going to be able to beat a team like that or they're not. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=252.54s)]
*  And they're either going to be able to overwhelm a team like that or work [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=255.5s)]
*  or they're not. And I thought there were stretches of this game where you could see [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=257.88s)]
*  the Thunder's completely mucking up Denver's pace of play, the flow of their [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=261.24s)]
*  offense, disrupting their defense by extension. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=265.52s)]
*  Like all the pieces were there during that run you were talking about. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=267.64s)]
*  And then the Nuggets just like reeled it back in one Julian Strother bucket at a [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  time, an incredible Jamal Murray third quarter that I thought like they do not [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=274.12s)]
*  win this game without it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=277.84s)]
*  And ultimately, like they have a calm and a patience that is really hard to manage [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=279.36s)]
*  against the way Oklahoma City plays defense. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=284.36s)]
*  Like this is a frenetic defensive front with a lot of activity that can force a [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=286.06s)]
*  lot of turnovers. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=290.02000000000004s)]
*  And until the Nuggets briefly lost their collective minds down the stretch of the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=291.3s)]
*  fourth quarter where they were just turning the ball over every possession, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=295.90000000000003s)]
*  they were actually winning the turnover battle in this game. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=298.46000000000004s)]
*  And it's like, if that's what the bulk of the game is going to be, Denver is going [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=300.46000000000004s)]
*  to win. And I don't think that reflects poorly on the Thunder just to say like [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=304.02000000000004s)]
*  they have to be able to match that level of precision in a game seven. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=307.3s)]
*  That's what makes OKC one of the many things that makes them so weird as a great [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=310.62s)]
*  team. Normally teams have runs and it's with threes, especially in the modern [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=314.7s)]
*  NBA. It's like, oh my God, 12-0 run, four threes. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=318.96s)]
*  Yeah. And OKC, it's all defense related. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=323.12s)]
*  Four steals in a row for OKC. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=325.76s)]
*  They've all turnovers and transition points. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=328.32s)]
*  And that's kind of how they come back in games with their defense. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=330.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm still not positive they know who their five guys should be down the stretch. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=334.76s)]
*  And I'm also not sure it matters. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=338.12s)]
*  But you think like game five. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=339.84s)]
*  I mean, think about think about this way. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=341.86s)]
*  If Dort doesn't get hot for three minutes in game five and if Jalen Williams [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=343.82s)]
*  doesn't make that shot on the left side, that I still can't believe went in those [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=349.42s)]
*  two events, Denver wins. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=353.94s)]
*  And now we have this game six where I think we probably get the same result. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=355.5s)]
*  Maybe so. Now we're going back for game seven. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=359.02000000000004s)]
*  And it's this is like the kind of series that I grew up with and you grew up with, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=361.3s)]
*  too. Like this is a classic 1980s. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=364.94s)]
*  We go back and forth. We go back and forth. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=367.90000000000003s)]
*  OK, here we go. Game seven. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=369.88s)]
*  Right. This is like CBS 1987. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=371.68s)]
*  Denver came back in game six and we're just doing it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=378.6s)]
*  We're playing all the hits and then OKC. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=381.96000000000004s)]
*  They got it out. They advance. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=384.28000000000003s)]
*  We talk about what an important series this was for their growth. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=385.84000000000003s)]
*  They had to get over the hump. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=389.04s)]
*  So it's all the makings of that. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=390.44s)]
*  And yet. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=393.36s)]
*  Yoga is so great. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=394.76s)]
*  I just I just don't want to play him if it's one game. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=396.0s)]
*  They have two days rest until Sunday. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=398.6s)]
*  And he's probably going to play what? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=401.38s)]
*  Forty three minutes. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=402.66s)]
*  Forty four minutes. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=404.78000000000003s)]
*  I doubt you can. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=405.82000000000005s)]
*  They did it today where they legler who I thought was fantastic today. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=407.66s)]
*  I really think he's he's the best TV analyst we have at this point. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=411.22s)]
*  And he was talking about even to get him an extra minute and a half in the fourth [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=415.90000000000003s)]
*  quarter was so huge. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=419.42s)]
*  Like think how stupid that is. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=420.5s)]
*  It's like, oh, we're able to not bring him back in until the eight minute mark [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=422.34000000000003s)]
*  instead of the nine thirty mark. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=426.76s)]
*  But that's like how important he's become now where you feel like if you can get [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=428.16s)]
*  to eight minutes in the fourth quarter, it's like a fucking miracle. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=431.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=434.56s)]
*  But that's who he is. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=435.08s)]
*  And that's where that nuggets team is. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=436.16s)]
*  I wonder if we'll see more of that from the Thunder to in game seven. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=437.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, obviously it's a season on the line game. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=440.68s)]
*  Everyone's going to play a little bit more. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=442.40000000000003s)]
*  But relative to this one. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=444.0s)]
*  Yes, there were a couple of Thunder players who were in foul trouble and that [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=445.64s)]
*  shook up the rotation. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=448.44s)]
*  I also thought Mark Dagonal in general was just like trying a bunch of very [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=449.8s)]
*  different stuff from what Oklahoma City usually does. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=453.24s)]
*  They played some lineups that were smaller than they ever play. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=455.52s)]
*  They were some lineups with Jalen Williams. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=458.7s)]
*  Jay Will is the only big on the court, which they very rarely, if not never do [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=460.74s)]
*  effectively in competitive games. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=465.14s)]
*  Stuff that we just like have not seen from them in the playoffs, including some [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=467.02s)]
*  shorter stints for their key guys where they were pulled in and out quickly to [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=469.97999999999996s)]
*  get a quick blow, to get a quick rest. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=473.94s)]
*  I'm kind of wondering from a coaching staff perspective for them, if they're [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=476.02s)]
*  thinking we can trust our decision making a little better if these guys are a [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=478.68s)]
*  little better rested. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=483.02s)]
*  But in doing so, you're trading off some minutes for really good players and [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=484.02s)]
*  you're trading them for guys who are a little flawed, who are going to have some [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=487.88s)]
*  streaky shooting or some bad turnover problems. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=491.53999999999996s)]
*  And I think those, those chickens kind of came home to roost for the Thunder a [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=493.78s)]
*  little bit. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=497.14s)]
*  Well, they had the SJ gets the fourth foul right near the end of the first half. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=497.91999999999996s)]
*  It's a terrible foul. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=501.59999999999997s)]
*  Really? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=503.08s)]
*  Like really, really? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=503.44s)]
*  Like even Carl Anthony Towns was like, wow, I can't, wow, I can't believe that. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=504.56s)]
*  So they play him the first five minutes of the, of the third quarter. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=509.59999999999997s)]
*  And then he pulls them. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=513.14s)]
*  Cause he knows, I just want to get, I'm glad I got that five minutes, but then [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=514.3199999999999s)]
*  he doesn't play the last seven minutes of third quarter and you really felt it. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=518.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=522.96s)]
*  Casey. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=523.26s)]
*  That's where it's like, nobody they have is really ready to run an offense in a [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=523.68s)]
*  game like that was that important for Denver for seven minutes. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=527.86s)]
*  And if you're talking about like, whatever happens to them, this is, I still [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=531.0s)]
*  think they're going to win the title, but if they don't, probably the thing they're [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=533.9399999999999s)]
*  going to look at is who can come off the bench and be somebody who can actually [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=537.8s)]
*  like create a little offense. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=542.42s)]
*  Like Isaiah, almost like Isaiah Joe as a lead guard type of person. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=544.18s)]
*  Just, I don't even know what that means. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=548.6999999999999s)]
*  I don't even know who that is, but like, like what the Celtics have with [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=550.5s)]
*  Peyton Pritchard where he can come in and be like, Oh, he might take some shots [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=554.38s)]
*  and he'll dribble and he'll push the pace and he's a change of pace. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=558.02s)]
*  They don't really have anybody like that. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=560.74s)]
*  So it all falls on Jaylen Williams. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=562.16s)]
*  And when he's bad, then what do you do? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=563.6999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=565.74s)]
*  I think Jaylen Williams, like he has elements and stretches and even in this [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=566.3s)]
*  game, like he ends up with 10 assists. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=569.5s)]
*  Like this is a good playmaking game for Jaylen Williams overall. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=570.66s)]
*  He's still critical in cracking that like first line of defense specifically [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=573.8s)]
*  when Denver is zone, uh, like he's a really important part of that equation. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=578.06s)]
*  And yeah, when Shays off the floor, obviously he's your go-to [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=582.26s)]
*  guy for all of that creation. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=584.74s)]
*  It just would be a little easier. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=586.02s)]
*  As you're saying, if you had a count, a back court counterpart who was a little [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=587.28s)]
*  bit more comfortable with the ball in their hands, just, just a little bit. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=590.92s)]
*  And you can do, you know, you can put Caruso in some of those spots as [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=593.9399999999999s)]
*  kind of a trigger man, but he's not a traditional like attacking ball handler. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=597.3599999999999s)]
*  At least you kind of don't want him to be, uh, case in wallets. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=600.9s)]
*  So again, I like a lot can get a little fast and loose with the [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=603.7s)]
*  passing and his handle. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=606.34s)]
*  Sometimes you just start looking around their back court rotation. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=607.38s)]
*  And it's a lot of guys who you trust in certain moments, you trust in certain [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=610.4000000000001s)]
*  roles, but there's a reason why she has the ball in his hands a lot. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=613.82s)]
*  And one is because he's really good at it. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=616.82s)]
*  And two is because they're just like, are not a ton of ball handling [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=618.6600000000001s)]
*  alternatives as a primary initiator. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=621.7s)]
*  And it doesn't matter when you're up 20 and you're up 15, which is where [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=624.6600000000001s)]
*  they've been the whole season. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=627.82s)]
*  And. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=629.22s)]
*  You know, odds, I didn't look at what the line is, but odds are [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=630.6600000000001s)]
*  they're going to be like eight, nine, 10 point favorites somewhere in there. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=633.48s)]
*  And yet. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=637.76s)]
*  Yoke edge. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=639.08s)]
*  Um, the Yoke edge stuff. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=639.9200000000001s)]
*  So I was looking his this year, last year and 23, the total year. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=642.72s)]
*  So now it was this 45 playoff games for him. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=647.0s)]
*  Pretty big sample size, 45 playoff games, 29 points a game, 13 rebounds [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=649.88s)]
*  a game, nine assisted games. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=654.32s)]
*  This is for 45 playoff games. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=655.52s)]
*  What does he have today? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=657.6s)]
*  29, 14 and eight. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=658.76s)]
*  Round the money. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=660.4s)]
*  So it's like, Whoa, you could chat a good game. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=661.28s)]
*  It's like, nah, it's typical Yoke edge playoff game at this point, uh, made [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=662.98s)]
*  his free throws down the stretch, which was something that was getting a little [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=666.22s)]
*  shaky there for a couple of games. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=669.82s)]
*  In general, it just feels like they played a ton of it. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=672.16s)]
*  It feels like they played twice as many playoff games as everyone else in the NBA. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=674.78s)]
*  Like these, it just, every single game feels like it has this extra weight to [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=678.86s)]
*  them and it's do or die and it's down the stretch and Yoke edge seems exhausted. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=682.78s)]
*  And nothing has been easy. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=687.34s)]
*  That Clipper series was a nightmare until game seven. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=689.5s)]
*  And then this series, you know, I'm sure they're kicking themselves about game five. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=692.98s)]
*  That's if they, they go home for the summer, game five is the one where [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=696.82s)]
*  it's going to be like, really Lou Dort? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=700.1s)]
*  I mean, the thunder of theirs too, like, you know, their Aaron Gordon moments, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=701.74s)]
*  like their, their counterbalancing forces in terms of like clutch play or street [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=704.86s)]
*  play, like this is the playoffs. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=709.66s)]
*  That's what happens. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=710.62s)]
*  Ultimately though, I think, I think you're zeroing in on the right [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=711.98s)]
*  factors for Denver, which is like, are they just going to have the energy [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=714.34s)]
*  reserves to finish this thing out when you'll get, everything is so hard for [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=717.94s)]
*  Yoke, I wouldn't say he was at any point in this game, exactly picking the thunder [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=722.18s)]
*  apart, it was more Oklahoma city is deciding they're going to obviously going [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=726.18s)]
*  to crowd the lane and put as many bodies around him as possible. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=730.66s)]
*  They're going to try to stay attached to Jamal Murray and they're basically [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=733.02s)]
*  taking away the Aaron Gordon lob from Yoke itch and they're just saying. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=735.7399999999999s)]
*  Christian Brown, Russell Westbrook, Michael Porter, Jr, Peyton Watson, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=740.02s)]
*  Julian Strother in this one. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=743.18s)]
*  Like we're just going to trust that we can rotate out to you fast enough to, to [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=744.18s)]
*  mess you up, whether it's taking the shot or putting the ball on the ground and [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=748.5799999999999s)]
*  Denver just like one enough of those plays, but it wasn't surgical. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=751.78s)]
*  It was difficult. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=755.14s)]
*  It was arduous. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=755.98s)]
*  Like it's challenging every single step of the way. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=756.8199999999999s)]
*  And they're going to have to do all of that again. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=759.38s)]
*  And they're going to have to do it all again against a team that is younger, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=761.3399999999999s)]
*  that is deeper, that has a little bit to rally. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=763.78s)]
*  They will have home court advantage. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=766.02s)]
*  Like the thunder have a lot of factors kind of swinging in their [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=767.3399999999999s)]
*  favor as, as this thing goes to seven. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=769.5799999999999s)]
*  Uh, and so it's like, you want to trust the kind of veteran know-how of the [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=771.66s)]
*  nuggets, but it's kind of hard to with the series that's been this balanced [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=775.5799999999999s)]
*  overall. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=778.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=779.4200000000001s)]
*  Especially when okay. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=779.62s)]
*  So he was just giving them corner threes, like they're free candy in a drug store. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=780.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=784.46s)]
*  Like take one. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=785.1s)]
*  No, take another one. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=785.82s)]
*  You want to drive toward the basket this time? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=786.78s)]
*  God, we'll give you that too. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=788.3000000000001s)]
*  They're just packing everything. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=789.62s)]
*  And that's why the yoga just sis totals. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=792.0600000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think he finished with eight today, which is high for the series. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=794.34s)]
*  A couple of those, like that last one he had to Brown was like the thread, the [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=797.9s)]
*  needle out of nowhere, Larry Bird type pass, but, uh, you know, they, they don't [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=801.5s)]
*  want him to finish with 12, 13, 14 assists. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=806.22s)]
*  I still feel like he could score even more. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=809.26s)]
*  There was a couple of times where he would get the ball at the foul line and he [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=811.4200000000001s)]
*  would turn and then he would just kick it out and it's like, just take heart and [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=814.74s)]
*  steam, like, you know, you can get that little lob jump hook on them at any time. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=818.3000000000001s)]
*  Um, has this series, I know it's a regular seasonal word. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=823.66s)]
*  Did you vote for a yolk edge or SGA? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=828.1800000000001s)]
*  I forget. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=829.9s)]
*  I voted yolk edge. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=830.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=831.62s)]
*  Did this series make you regret anything or feel stronger about your vote? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=832.34s)]
*  I mean, I know it's playoffs is different than regular season, but to me, it's [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=836.6999999999999s)]
*  like, I felt like it really made the cases for both guys, especially game five. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=840.4599999999999s)]
*  But I feel better about the Oak edge vote. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=845.5s)]
*  Um, I just, I think he's the best player in 13 years. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=847.9799999999999s)]
*  I think that's, that's the area. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=854.18s)]
*  Like it is a completely separate award. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=855.54s)]
*  It is a regular season award. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=857.3s)]
*  As you said, those are the criteria. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=858.5s)]
*  Part of my criteria in voting for yolk edge was I think he's the best player [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=861.26s)]
*  in the world. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=864.74s)]
*  And I start from that place and anyone else who I'm going to vote for instead [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=865.5400000000001s)]
*  kind of has to prove overwhelmingly that they are the best player instead, or [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=868.46s)]
*  that they had a superior season instead. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=872.1400000000001s)]
*  I thought she got really close and I couldn't quite get there. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=874.26s)]
*  Uh, but ultimately like this does confirm that, like I think yolk edge has been [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=877.34s)]
*  the best player in the playoffs overall. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=880.9000000000001s)]
*  I think he's been the best player in the series overall. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=882.46s)]
*  When I, him or Julius Randall, it's now, it's now toss up. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=884.98s)]
*  One of the two. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=888.3000000000001s)]
*  Uh, you know, she had a tremendous game, but I think you, and if anything, I [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=889.5400000000001s)]
*  thought him running into the wall in this particular game had much more to do [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=893.58s)]
*  with the fact that his teammates couldn't hit shots. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=897.62s)]
*  And so all of a sudden you see the crowd coming in around him. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=899.46s)]
*  He can't get to the basket anymore, but I thought this was Shea's most successful [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=902.0600000000001s)]
*  game, breaking down the defense, getting all the way to the rim. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=906.0200000000001s)]
*  He was pretty relentless in that regard. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=909.5400000000001s)]
*  And I wonder how much of that had to do with, he was kind of holding his right [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=911.14s)]
*  hand for a lot of this game. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=914.46s)]
*  It seemed like he injured it or jammed it somehow. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=916.5s)]
*  We'll have to see kind of what happens with that. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=918.34s)]
*  Uh, and so maybe he was looking to drive more than shoot, but I thought it suited [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=920.4200000000001s)]
*  him. I thought he did a really good job with that part of his game, which has [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=923.82s)]
*  not been a given against this Denver defense for a lot of these contests. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=926.5s)]
*  Really, really, really, really great scoring guard. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=930.2600000000001s)]
*  I mean, he is 11 for 16 today. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=933.0200000000001s)]
*  Unreal. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=934.94s)]
*  They were keying on him. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=935.3800000000001s)]
*  He just always takes good shots. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=936.5400000000001s)]
*  It's surprising when he misses. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=938.82s)]
*  He just has figured out how to navigate all the weird pseudo travel, pseudo carry [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=941.0600000000001s)]
*  stuff that people get away with. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=946.1400000000001s)]
*  He's like one of the best at it. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=947.74s)]
*  Always is like able to pull off an extra like foot and a half, two feet. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=949.3399999999999s)]
*  Um, I haven't really seen anybody slow him down. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=953.02s)]
*  You know, Chris Dunn, a tiny bit, not Chris Dunn, uh, who'd they play in the last [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=957.6999999999999s)]
*  one on Blanken who was the guy. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=962.26s)]
*  And there was one guy on Memphis that I felt like, did anyone on Memphis really [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=964.6999999999999s)]
*  slow him down? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=968.5s)]
*  Why? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=969.38s)]
*  Maybe, maybe nobody, maybe I'm just hallucinating with all due respect to the [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=969.8199999999999s)]
*  Grizzlies. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=973.9399999999999s)]
*  Chris Dunn did a, I guess he did a good job on Murray a couple of times until he [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=975.14s)]
*  could have make a corner three anymore. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=979.5s)]

*  What was up with that guy? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1074.02s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1075.1399999999999s)]
*  Degree listened. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1076.58s)]
*  They admitted they messed up. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1077.98s)]
*  They're bringing back the original cool rush sent and thank God you've got to [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1079.26s)]
*  love what a brand can own its mistakes. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1085.6599999999999s)]
*  And it's in Walmart, Target and other stores right now for under $4. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1087.6599999999999s)]
*  Grab some, find out why it's been the number one men's antiperspirant for the [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1092.9799999999998s)]
*  last decade. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1098.5s)]
*  By the way, you should put that on, especially we're about to hit the summer. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1099.26s)]
*  It's getting sweaty in the summers. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1102.6999999999998s)]
*  The original degree cool rush is back and it smells like victory for all of us. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1104.4599999999998s)]
*  Pressure rankings for game seven. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1109.9799999999998s)]
*  Who has the most pressure in this game? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1113.58s)]
*  Who are you the most worried about? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1115.6999999999998s)]
*  I think we already answered it. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1117.78s)]
*  I think it's Jalen Williams. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1118.78s)]
*  I think so too. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1120.1s)]
*  And maybe two is Chet. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1122.02s)]
*  In what capacity? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1125.7399999999998s)]
*  Guarding Jokic or threes or what? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1126.78s)]
*  Just as a third scoring option. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1129.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, he doesn't really guard Jokic that all that much. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1131.54s)]
*  Like they want Isaiah Hardenstein on him as much as possible. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1133.78s)]
*  So for me, it's more, can Chet do the right balance of finishing like contested [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1136.4199999999998s)]
*  finishes inside against other bigs like Jokic, which we saw he kind of struggled [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1143.34s)]
*  with some of that in this game. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1146.78s)]
*  Will he have opportunities to beat smalls inside who are kind of cross-matched [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1148.1399999999999s)]
*  against him and Denver's gotten away with that for parts of the series overall, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1151.78s)]
*  like putting smaller guys on him for stretches, whether it's man or zone. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1155.06s)]
*  And then the threes are going to be what they are. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1158.94s)]
*  Like that's going to come and go a little bit and you're going to have to live with [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1160.58s)]
*  that balance with Chet. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1163.1399999999999s)]
*  It's always like, where are you finding the other offense? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1164.54s)]
*  I thought he found enough in this one overall, but a new game is a new day. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1166.78s)]
*  Like you're going to have to do that all over again. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1170.54s)]
*  You have to get like run the court and transition and finish as well as you did [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1172.26s)]
*  all over again. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1175.02s)]
*  Like those two guys are such huge variables in a game like this, just [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1176.38s)]
*  because we haven't, we haven't seen them do it in the way that we've seen Jamal [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1179.42s)]
*  Murray do it before. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1182.82s)]
*  So you have, I agree with this, Jalen Williams one, Chet two, then a Denver [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1184.66s)]
*  guy has to be three. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1192.54s)]
*  So who's the Denver guy? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1193.6200000000001s)]
*  Probably Michael Porter Jr. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1195.54s)]
*  Do we, can you have pressure if I'm not expecting anything from you? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1198.06s)]
*  I would say it's Christian Brown because the threes, what was he on the threes [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1201.34s)]
*  today? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1205.42s)]
*  He shot quite well from three to three for six. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1206.78s)]
*  I feel like if he can hit some threes, now I at least have a semi fourth guy. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1209.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1216.66s)]
*  And Porter is just, I have no idea what I'm getting with him. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1217.3s)]
*  I mean, Porter just seems, I feel bad for him because I don't think we knew he was [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1220.3s)]
*  hurt in the quipper series, at least for a couple games. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1223.98s)]
*  Now we know like we're going to find out. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1227.06s)]
*  It's quite bad. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1228.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1229.46s)]
*  We were going to find out he has like torn ligaments in his shoulder or whatever it [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1229.7s)]
*  is. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1232.5s)]
*  Um, but it's just too erratic. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1233.22s)]
*  He's better than he's playing. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1234.78s)]
*  He is better than he's playing. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1236.3s)]
*  I think the trade-off is Christian Brown, regardless of whether he's hitting threes [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1237.22s)]
*  or not, we'll get you cutting baskets. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1240.58s)]
*  We'll get you transition baskets. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1243.42s)]
*  We'll, we'll play great defense at the, whether it's at the top of that zone or [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1244.74s)]
*  guarding someone like Shea for the majority of these games, like he's going [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1248.1s)]
*  to provide value when Michael Porter Jr. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1251.46s)]
*  isn't hitting shots. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1254.02s)]
*  He doesn't provide a lot of value. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1254.78s)]
*  And you saw some plays where he was just getting, not only, you know, like [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1256.1s)]
*  beat on ball, but beat back door, beat in rotation. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1259.74s)]
*  Like just, they need that. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1262.66s)]
*  And like Christian Brown, I think to me is there. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1264.7s)]
*  Like he's going to, his, his offensive contributions are going to vary a little [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1266.54s)]
*  bit. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1269.8600000000001s)]
*  You have the rock solid top three, then you have whatever you get offensively [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1270.02s)]
*  from Christian Brown. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1273.26s)]
*  And then it's how do we string together enough minutes to make this rotation work? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1273.98s)]
*  And not only did you get good Julian Strother minutes in this game, I thought [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1278.66s)]
*  you got really good paid Watson minutes for stretches, like offensively, not [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1281.42s)]
*  exactly what you want, but his block on JDub in transition in the fourth quarter [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1284.5s)]
*  was one of the biggest plays of the game. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1288.7s)]
*  His like their collective ability, that group to survive the non-Yokich minutes [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1290.7s)]
*  at the beginning of the fourth quarter. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1294.94s)]
*  Again, a crucial Julian Strother time, as crazy as that sounds, unbelievably [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1296.14s)]
*  important in a game like this. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1300.6200000000001s)]
*  And so the cascading effect to all the other nuggets, those are guys I expect a [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1301.8200000000002s)]
*  little less of Michael Porter Jr. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1305.5400000000002s)]
*  kind of like needs to give them 20 to 30 playable minutes. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1307.14s)]
*  And we're going to see if that's possible for him in game seven or not. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1311.42s)]
*  I watch a lot of nuggets and Westbrook. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1315.3000000000002s)]
*  There can be like he's chest out maniacs screaming to the crowd Westbrook, or he [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1319.26s)]
*  can be, I'm in my own, own head Westbrook, which we've seen at a lot of different [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1324.26s)]
*  end of the seasons. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1327.6200000000001s)]
*  I don't think he's looked the same in the last two games. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1329.02s)]
*  I'm not even talking about how he's playing. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1331.3400000000001s)]
*  And I really wonder if that Ramona Shelburne story in ESPN was a bad thing for him. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1333.38s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1338.94s)]
*  Because, um, I just, he, he, he's looked the last two games. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1339.5800000000002s)]
*  As you know, I'm the body language doctor. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1343.6200000000001s)]
*  I graduated 1998. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1345.18s)]
*  Um, do you have to like re certify your boards or something? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1347.82s)]
*  No, I just got the diploma and just put it up. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1350.62s)]
*  It's over there. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1352.3799999999999s)]
*  You're done. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1352.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1353.6599999999999s)]
*  It's over there. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1354.22s)]
*  I just think you should keep up with the most recent like research on these [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1355.3799999999999s)]
*  subjects and you should have to go to a conference or maybe I should go take a [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1358.1399999999999s)]
*  psychology seminar every once in a while. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1361.06s)]
*  His body language, the last two games felt a little last year on the [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1363.1799999999998s)]
*  LeBron Lakers ish to me or Clippers playoff fish, just a little off the rails [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1366.6999999999998s)]
*  and not, I thought one of the cool things about, especially in the, uh, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1372.86s)]
*  Quipper series was he really, he really brought energy and charisma and [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1375.8999999999999s)]
*  personality and passion and seemed like it was the teammates were in. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1381.4199999999998s)]
*  You have these stories where you have unnamed teammates taking shots at you. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1385.54s)]
*  And I don't know that like, he's a human being. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1388.8999999999999s)]
*  Like if you read that or hear about that, you, you all of a sudden you have [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1391.1s)]
*  eyeballs in the back of your head, but I thought it was, I just think there's [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1394.8999999999999s)]
*  a strange vibe to him. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1397.86s)]
*  I don't know if the O playing an OKC. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1398.9399999999998s)]
*  I think that part's also weird where he's, you know, the most popular [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1400.74s)]
*  OKC player ever. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1404.02s)]
*  He leaves, they immediately replace him with a more popular player and a better [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1404.94s)]
*  team. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1409.18s)]
*  And, you know, it seems like he's got, even in the first couple of games of [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1409.7s)]
*  series, I felt like he was really taking that personally. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1413.46s)]
*  Now he feels more like Clippers series last year, train wreck Russ than additive [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1415.58s)]
*  Russ. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1422.46s)]
*  The tricky thing with him is like, you want to give him credit and be forgiving [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1423.38s)]
*  of the energy he plays with rally. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1427.34s)]
*  He is attacking these possessions in ways that is like undeniable and is, is [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1428.98s)]
*  valuable in series like the Clippers one at points in this series as well. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1432.82s)]
*  But you're seeing a weird tension point with him, specifically with the [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1436.74s)]
*  Thunder, where the Thunder want to get out and run so badly. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1440.02s)]
*  And Russell Westbrook wants to both drive and hit the offensive glass so badly [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1442.8999999999999s)]
*  available. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1447.3s)]
*  And he's going and he'll miss a lot of those opportunities and great. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1448.5s)]
*  Those are opportunities he's creating out of thin air with effort. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1451.46s)]
*  But then he ends up on the ground and two other nuggets are trying to hit the [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1454.18s)]
*  offensive glass. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1457.26s)]
*  And now all of a sudden you have three on one for the Thunder going the other way. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1457.98s)]
*  And so you have this like push and pull of, yeah, you want those energy and effort [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1460.78s)]
*  plays, but maybe not all the time and maybe not consecutively. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1464.7s)]
*  Like I think the end of the game was perfect when he, when he broke the press [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1468.6200000000001s)]
*  and that was the clinching play of the game. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1471.98s)]
*  That was big first quarter. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1474.3s)]
*  He comes in and there are like five straight Russ possessions, turnovers, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1476.02s)]
*  misses. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1480.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1481.3s)]
*  I think he gets to the free throw line. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1481.38s)]
*  One of those times, I swear that's happened 10 times where for 90 seconds, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1482.46s)]
*  it's the worst 90 seconds you've ever seen in your life. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1486.38s)]
*  It's like four plays in a row where you're like, Oh my God, he had four [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1488.82s)]
*  turnovers and two mislay ups in this game in 16 minutes. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1491.98s)]
*  You just have to hope that it offsets at some point, right? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1495.62s)]
*  That the other plays swing the other way and you get enough good Russ to [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1497.86s)]
*  counteract the bad Russ, but they're going to have to ride him regardless. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1501.1399999999999s)]
*  Like he's going to have to play significant minutes in game seven. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1504.62s)]
*  He's going to play a role in game seven. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1507.46s)]
*  Uh, hopefully he does a little bit better on balance than he did in this one. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1509.5s)]
*  Cause I thought, I thought this was a rough Russ performance. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1512.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1515.26s)]
*  See favored by eight in game seven. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1515.54s)]
*  The case for them in game seven, if we're going to play both sides, almost [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1517.58s)]
*  like how I do for a football playoff game where I'm like, all right, if [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1520.8999999999999s)]
*  this team wins, here's how I think it goes. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1524.54s)]
*  If this team wins the South school, okay. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1526.54s)]
*  See wins. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1528.4199999999998s)]
*  Shea will get his 31 to 33 figure a solid two, very good Jay, the Williams [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1529.34s)]
*  game somewhere in there chats, probably in the 1911 range, the key with game [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1534.9399999999998s)]
*  sevens and you saw it, uh, last round. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1540.1799999999998s)]
*  There's always a weird guy. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1544.4599999999998s)]
*  There's a grant Williams hitting six threes. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1546.18s)]
*  There's Christian Brown and game seven who just catches fire from three. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1548.1399999999999s)]
*  There's always a role player who has an awesome game and okay. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1552.1s)]
*  See, there's a lot more candidates for this than Denver does. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1555.26s)]
*  I mean, we could pick, you could go Lou Dora, you go Caruso here. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1558.06s)]
*  You can say case on Wallace is going to come in and hit five threes. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1561.58s)]
*  It could be one of those dudes. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1564.6599999999999s)]
*  They're up by 18 defense kicks in and they're just comfortably ahead. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1566.1s)]
*  I think if Denver wins, it's the classic Yocage plays 44 minutes. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1571.66s)]
*  They have the lead most of the game. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1578.3s)]
*  They're up seven with, you know, nine minutes left. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1580.06s)]
*  They're rolling the ball in. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1583.38s)]
*  He's just killing clock and he does that thing. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1584.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1587.5s)]
*  He's literally the best ever at it of I'm going to kill. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1587.8600000000001s)]
*  I'm just going to shave seconds off this clock. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1591.54s)]
*  Even before the 20th, I'm going to make this a 35 second possession with all the. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1593.66s)]
*  Um, I think Murray has to come through. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1598.18s)]
*  I think Brown needs to hit threes. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1600.26s)]
*  Westbrook needs to be additive, not subtractive. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1602.42s)]
*  I don't even, I'm not even going to say we need a Strother Watson. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1605.26s)]
*  I'm not expecting that. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1609.5s)]
*  I don't think those guys show up. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1610.54s)]
*  They need five guys and I think Westbrook has to be one of them. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1611.74s)]
*  What do you, what do you think? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1614.46s)]
*  Five guys makes sense. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1615.6200000000001s)]
*  I could easily see this being a Denver game where only six players for the [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1616.8600000000001s)]
*  nuggets play considerable minutes. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1620.54s)]
*  One of them, as you said, being Russ, in addition to that starting five on OKC [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1622.74s)]
*  side, like I am fascinated by the JDub element. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1627.1399999999999s)]
*  Like I think Crusoe is someone I just don't bet against in games like this. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1630.06s)]
*  Lou Dort. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1633.58s)]
*  I like, I really respect the way Lou Dort will fire. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1634.86s)]
*  Like he's being challenged to hit shots. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1638.8999999999999s)]
*  That's going to go whichever way it goes, whichever way the wind is blowing. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1641.2199999999998s)]
*  His confidence though, does not get shaken. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1644.1399999999999s)]
*  And I think Oklahoma City needs some of that in this game. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1646.5s)]
*  Seven, like you're part of the issue with JDub and Chet both. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1648.62s)]
*  You're seeing, you've seen both of those guys over these last two games. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1652.4599999999998s)]
*  Airball throughs, like bad, bad misses. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1655.7800000000002s)]
*  And you've seen a lot of Thunder players up and down the, up and down the rotation, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1659.0600000000002s)]
*  like miss dunks, miss layups, like very makeable stuff for them. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1662.5400000000002s)]
*  Of course, if enough of those plays swing again, like they're going to win a game [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1667.0600000000002s)]
*  like this one, but moreover, like they just need guys who are going to have nerves [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1670.42s)]
*  of steel. Like I trust Shay in those moments. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1674.1000000000001s)]
*  I trust Lou Dort and Crusoe in those moments. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1675.98s)]
*  I trust Isaiah Hardenstein in those moments. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1678.18s)]
*  I think like, even though Jokic is like having a Nicole Jokic series, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1680.0200000000002s)]
*  Oklahoma City just isn't in this at all. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1684.6999999999998s)]
*  I don't think without Hardenstein playing him defensively the way he is, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1686.58s)]
*  wearing him down to the degree that one can has been so important. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1689.82s)]
*  But like, I think they just need that kind of nerve that you're going to get from [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1694.06s)]
*  Jamal Murray. And on the Murray side, like he almost was a scratch in this game [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1697.5s)]
*  because of an illness. Is Jamal Murray feeling better in 48 hours or is he at the [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1701.06s)]
*  start of something that's going to get worse in 48 hours? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1705.22s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1707.4199999999998s)]
*  If I was a coach, I'd plant those. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1708.3s)]
*  Say, I don't know if we're getting Jamal today. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1710.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. We'll see. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1711.82s)]
*  Game time. And then Jamal's fine. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1713.26s)]
*  Okay. He's like, Jamal, Jamal, he's not going to play. Yeah. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1716.3s)]
*  I know you said Chet's not guarding Jokic, but I still feel like he's one of the [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1721.2199999999998s)]
*  two people guarding Jokic, even though he's not really guarding. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1725.2199999999998s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1727.6999999999998s)]
*  Yes. Yeah, for sure. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1728.1399999999999s)]
*  He's they're basically double and Crusoe is the other one. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1729.02s)]
*  It's those three. And then there's the 10 Jalen Williams minutes who I think, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1732.02s)]
*  I think Jalen Williams has outkicked his coverage in the series. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1735.4199999999998s)]
*  It's pretty solid. Yeah. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1738.6599999999999s)]
*  Been a little feisty. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1740.4199999999998s)]
*  Um, one of the things with the game seven, you know, some guys just, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1741.74s)]
*  they just shrink from the moment. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1748.06s)]
*  And it usually happens with the younger teams or the role players or like even, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1751.1s)]
*  I know it wasn't a game six yesterday. It was a game. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1756.06s)]
*  Oh, not a game seven. It was a game five, but the role players can go sideways. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1758.7s)]
*  Like you have like the streus goes over nine short tie Jerome doesn't look like [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1762.82s)]
*  Ty Jerome anymore. It's funny. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1767.3s)]
*  It's funny to hear some of the dialogue about that. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1769.82s)]
*  I thought Indiana was just clearly better. And it's like, well, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1771.98s)]
*  Cleveland had all these injuries. It's like, I don't know. Did they, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1775.94s)]
*  like their role parts fell apart? Were those guys hurt? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1778.18s)]
*  That part was true. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1781.14s)]
*  I think Garland was definitely a little hampered, but it's just, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1781.98s)]
*  so they should lose in five and get killed in a couple of the games and just [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1785.9s)]
*  roll over at home and a must-win game. Like that's cause Garland's toe hurt. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1789.86s)]
*  Like there was way deeper stuff going on with them. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1793.9s)]
*  And I thought Indiana kind of broke them as the series goes, went along. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1796.98s)]
*  I think that has to be Denver's goal in Oklahoma city. It's a young team. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1801.18s)]
*  Can you break them? Can you make them doubt themselves? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1805.1s)]
*  Can you be super physical with them? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1807.42s)]
*  And you have this just model if it's center who needs two guys to stop them at [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1808.98s)]
*  all times. And can he just elevate everybody? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1813.06s)]
*  Nothing against them. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1816.1s)]
*  That's definitely the model. Yeah. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1817.22s)]
*  They're like the mental game has to be a huge portion of it for Denver. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1818.74s)]
*  Like in the case of a nuggets win, it is wearing them down. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1822.1s)]
*  It is putting enough pressure on the Thunder where they have that second or [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1825.02s)]
*  third quarter swoon, where they just go completely off the rails. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1828.06s)]
*  I just think with OKC, that's pretty tough to do generally. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1831.54s)]
*  Unless you see kind of even in this game, like they weren't hitting shots, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1834.46s)]
*  but I thought they stuck to their process. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1838.14s)]
*  I thought they kept executing on defense. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1839.74s)]
*  Like they are who they are for a reason in terms of their dominant regular season [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1841.46s)]
*  and the nuggets who they are, who they are for a reason in terms of their ability [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1846.1s)]
*  to pull out series like this. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1849.22s)]
*  And so I, I think the Thunder are a tough team to take off the tracks. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1850.82s)]
*  I think that there are going to be times where, yeah, they show their youth more [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1854.46s)]
*  than others. I would be shocked if OKC gets like really shaken up to the point [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1857.18s)]
*  that they just fold. That just doesn't really seem to be in the DNA of this [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1862.58s)]
*  group. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1865.3400000000001s)]
*  You know, when I went to that game for the Cooper series, which was just the best [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1866.54s)]
*  game I've seen in eight years and the nuggets came out, it was clearly like a [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1871.02s)]
*  game seven for them and they had all these things they wanted to do. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1874.7s)]
*  And one of them was Gordon was just going to really, really attack Kawhi 94 feet [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1878.46s)]
*  and was really agro physical and Yocage was just a maniac yelling at the refs. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1883.1399999999999s)]
*  And I think if they come out that way, I think they can win. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1888.3799999999999s)]
*  I think if Gordon comes out like I'm taking Jalen Williams out of this game, I [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1891.78s)]
*  think I can get into his head. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1896.1799999999998s)]
*  I think I can bang guys around. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1898.82s)]
*  I think I can control the boards with Yocage. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1900.94s)]
*  I think we can get the rebounding advantage. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1902.8999999999999s)]
*  I think we can talk shit. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1904.7s)]
*  You get Murray talking shit. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1906.3s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1907.7s)]
*  I, I, even though they were the champs two years ago instead of one year ago, it's [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1908.5s)]
*  I hate playing teams that have been in a lot of games like this. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1912.98s)]
*  So this is it. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1916.8600000000001s)]
*  If OKC gets through this, they win the title. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1917.9s)]
*  Nobody's that I just don't think anybody stops them if they win this game. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1920.26s)]
*  I think that's what it is. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1924.38s)]
*  Like, I'm not sure if Denver is definitively the second best team or not. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1925.14s)]
*  You know, assuming the Oklahoma city is the best, like if these are the top two [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1929.38s)]
*  teams or not, but if Oklahoma city can survive this, that they are unquestionably [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1932.46s)]
*  good enough to win it all. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1937.98s)]
*  I mean, I thought that regardless, I picked them as the, my, my choice to win [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1938.8200000000002s)]
*  the title coming in. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1942.26s)]
*  I maintain that. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1943.9s)]
*  I think they will pull out game seven. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1944.82s)]
*  But this is what you got to do to do it. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1946.9s)]
*  Like, I mean, this is nut crunching time of the highest order, a game seven [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1948.62s)]
*  against the nuggets and they're going to have to prove it every possible way. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1952.78s)]
*  Indiana versus OKC. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1956.54s)]
*  If that ends up being the finals, it's pretty good finals. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1958.3s)]
*  I just, I love Indiana. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1963.18s)]
*  I really think they know who they are and I think they're really hard to play. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1965.3799999999999s)]
*  And I think they would, they're not afraid of anybody. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAKAS0_GFs&t=1968.7s)]
