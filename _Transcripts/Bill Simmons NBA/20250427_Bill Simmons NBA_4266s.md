# The Lakers in Trouble, Ant’s Ascension, and Shedeur’s Inexplicable Slide | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo)
*  All right. We are recording a little after 3 30 on Sunday afternoon. We told van Lathan to come [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=0.0s)]
*  join us and talk draft between the two sets of games. But the Lakers game was so awesome [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=5.04s)]
*  against Minnesota. Minnesota goes up three one that we're just going to do this now. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=10.0s)]
*  Add a sequence. We're still a year guy, Anthony Edwards, 43 points, nine rebounds, six assists, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=13.92s)]
*  44 minutes, a key cut in the last 15 seconds of the game during a broken play. And they end up [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=19.28s)]
*  beating the Lakers three games to one. There was a lot of high end offensive chess going on there [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=25.68s)]
*  with Edwards. I was really impressed. They're doubling them. They're not doubling them. They're [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=34.0s)]
*  doubling them again. And he was just kind of figuring it out. I thought that was the best [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=37.36s)]
*  game I've seen him play. I loved it. I think he's just turning into a star in a way. I think we [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  thought we were seeing it last year. So maybe we're just doing the same thing all over again, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=46.72s)]
*  just a year later. Just love to see him get to the free throw line after 26 field goal attempts [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=50.96s)]
*  in game three and zero free throw attempts, which is fucking impossible. But they found a way to do [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=55.52s)]
*  it. So look, I think it was all about the size part of it, even though the Lakers five guys they [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=61.2s)]
*  play are big players. It's not like they're small where you're absolutely right. Like I love I'm [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=67.68s)]
*  still like adrenaline rush after this game because of the chess part of it going. Yeah, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=73.68s)]
*  JJ going to survive playing these five guys, his best five guys, is he going to survive playing them [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=78.08s)]
*  the entire second half and like Luca allows LeBron to coast a bit. LeBron was great tonight. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  Reeves had a great second half. Rui hit every shot that he had to hit because people were helping [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=90.64s)]
*  off of him. But in the beginning of the fourth quarter and you're watching going, it looks like [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=95.2s)]
*  he can drive on these dudes. I was upset Finch called the timeout to save it before the three [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=98.88s)]
*  minute mark. I'm like, why are you calling a timeout to even give these guys any kind of break? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=103.52s)]
*  Because I think that's what JJ was hoping. Will there be stoppages? Can I get some energy back [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=107.36s)]
*  in these dudes? And look, it comes down to make or miss either way. And LeBron made some great [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=111.44s)]
*  defensive plays there. But they're a three one. Don't step on all the points. We got a lot of [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  points here. No, no, no, I know. I just, I love this game. Can we go back to the five guys though? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=119.92s)]
*  The JJ rolling the dice? Yeah, whatever you want to do. I'm too excited. So take over. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=126.24s)]
*  No, JJ did the same thing the Nuggets did yesterday. They're like, our bench sucks. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=130.72s)]
*  And we're playing again and we have the extra day off. Extra day. Can we win this game in the first [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=136.72s)]
*  42 minutes and maybe stagger the minutes so that the last six minutes don't matter and they go for [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=142.0s)]
*  the kill the same way the Nuggets did. And yet the Timberwolves hung around, hung around, hung around, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=146.64s)]
*  hung around. I thought LeBron looked exhausted and yet he made like three of the better defensive [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=151.12s)]
*  plays of the playoffs. Van, when you watch, I know you're a Laker fan, we should mention. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=156.08s)]
*  Yeah. So you're watching this and they're just not, JJ's like, fuck it. No bench. LeBron, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=161.92s)]
*  just run in the corner during some offensive possessions. Maybe you can grab 20 seconds there. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=168.48s)]
*  Maybe there'll be a challenge. Are you like, why aren't you playing the bench or are you like, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=172.95999999999998s)]
*  this is the right move? It felt like this was that it was the right move. It just, it, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=176.48s)]
*  to be honest with you, you know, I never get mad at coaches when they tighten up rotations in the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  playoffs. Everything is so high leverage. You go with the guys that got you there. You trust the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  guys that got you there. That was a tight rotation. That's a super tight rotation. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=191.04s)]
*  It's a super tight rotation. Tighter than no rotation. It really wasn't a rotation. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=195.76s)]
*  There's no rotation. No rotating. No rotation at all. So I never, I never get on coaches when [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  they do that, particularly JJ, who is really in an interesting situation as a coach, right? He [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=207.28s)]
*  gets a team that is, has the bones of a decent team. Then he gets Luca, the expectations ratchet [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=213.44s)]
*  through the roof. Now he's in the playoffs against an opponent that everybody expects him to beat. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=220.0s)]
*  And they are not beating them and they are getting outplayed out hustled. And to be honest with you [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=225.84s)]
*  kind of out coached as well. So the fact that he decided that he was going to kind of go with the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=231.52s)]
*  guys that he could trust the most didn't really surprise me. I am really, really impressed with [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=236.64s)]
*  Anthony Edwards though, like ridiculously impressed with his ability to figure the game out on the fly [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=241.6s)]
*  and really be like a dominating figure for the, for the temple wolves to rally behind. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=247.28s)]
*  Yeah. You're watching this. You're going, they can just stay within like [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=252.8s)]
*  five to seven with five minutes left. They have the younger team and the better legs and they have [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=257.2s)]
*  aunt who's going to be the least tired out of all of these guys. I thought what LeBron did coming [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=261.84s)]
*  off Friday night, we're still, I think you and I saw it the same way that Friday night game was [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=266.64s)]
*  super physical grueling and it almost seemed unfair. They had to play like 40 hours later. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=270.64s)]
*  It just seemed like a bad schedule spot for them. Not even I thought JJ was going to go the other [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=275.36s)]
*  way and be like, I, I got to play the bench guys more because my guys are going to be dead from [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  Friday night. It was the opposite. And LeBron, especially the first three quarters, I don't [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=285.44s)]
*  really understand what I'm seeing anymore at age 40 for him on defense. This is like, he looks like [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=290.24s)]
*  2013 Miami heat LeBron in some of these moments. Um, but they had those two guys humming in the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=294.8s)]
*  first half and they're still, what was it like a three point game at halftime? Uh, I just don't [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=302.4s)]
*  think they have enough. And at the same time, I would not bet against them coming back from three [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=308.0s)]
*  one. Do you, are you in the, I think this is too tall of a task for Lakers zone or do you think [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=312.0s)]
*  there's a path for them? Well, you know, like after the first game, you're, you're thinking, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=317.12s)]
*  okay, that was really ugly. Like seeing it happen, you go, oh my God, like they're too big for them. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=324.48s)]
*  Like this is actually like a real problem. And then you're like, yeah, but Naz read and [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=329.12s)]
*  Jayden McDaniel scored 48 points and nobody missed any shots. It felt for like, for like a half an [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=333.36s)]
*  hour real time. And then you have the Luka game and game two were like, all right. And now Jayden [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=338.16s)]
*  wasn't very good. So this, this makes a lot of sense. I mean, Jayden wasn't really much [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=342.96s)]
*  tonight. Nas didn't make any shots. So it's not like they get the full compliment game. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=347.12s)]
*  Luca, it's, it's just so hard to doubt him, but you know, look, he, he had the stuff where he [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=352.32s)]
*  kept getting stuck in the trap and I don't know why he would keep doing it other than there was [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=358.32s)]
*  a lot of times it worked. Like it would work out of the trap and LeBron would end up with the ball. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=362.48s)]
*  Then he would make the perfect read and then swing it. And just Rui was so huge in that third quarter, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=366.96s)]
*  but I do think there's just more moves for Finch where JJ basically admitted tonight, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=371.84s)]
*  like unless Luka is making insane shots or he and LeBron are taking turns, you know, I don't, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=378.96s)]
*  I just don't know that they can, they can hang with this team because the same thing happened [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=385.6s)]
*  on Friday where when it mattered, it felt like Minnesota had a few more things they felt good [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=390.40000000000003s)]
*  about, even though the number one score to number two is a big drop off. And you know, look, Randall's [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=396.16s)]
*  had a bit of a rebirth here, which is one of the biggest reasons why I think they were motivated [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=401.12s)]
*  to do that cat trade as bad as it looked for so much of the season. It was just, there's going [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=406.08000000000004s)]
*  to be so much pressure on Ant in the playoffs. The secondary option needs to be able to create [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=410.72s)]
*  some stuff on his own with the ball. And I think that was even though, you know, Randall's not [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=415.52000000000004s)]
*  exactly like everybody was going, oh my God, they got Randall. I think that was part of the basketball [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=420.48s)]
*  approach to having him there. And you're seeing it. My favorite Randall stretch I've seen been [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=424.40000000000003s)]
*  probably ever in his career from a two way standpoint. I'd given up. This would be a good, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=429.20000000000005s)]
*  it'd be a good website or like where you just track where you like, where it's like, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=435.76000000000005s)]
*  have you given up yet? Or are you still holding on? I would have just checked the, I've given up [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=440.0s)]
*  box on Randall. I'd love the way he played. He also seems physically like just not afraid of [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=444.4s)]
*  Luca or LeBron. And I think that's one of the problems for the Lakers in this series is [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=448.8s)]
*  Minnesota has kind of the same kind of size, like just bodies to bang with them, at least make it [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=453.52s)]
*  hard for them. But were you ever out on Randall? Where'd you stand? I felt like he had kind of [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=459.04s)]
*  outlived his NBA usage, his usefulness at like a high level. I didn't know that we, yeah, I didn't [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=464.8s)]
*  know that we would ever see him being a difference or a difference maker in a playoff series again. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=471.76s)]
*  It just seemed like it was petering out. And when you look at it, the trade looked like, it looks [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=476.0s)]
*  now like a trade that worked out for each team. You know, you see Kat and the Knicks have a big [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=480.24s)]
*  win and he's playing really well. And Randall has really found a way to fit in with the Timberwolves [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=485.04s)]
*  in a way that I did not think that he would be able to. I thought that he was going to stop the [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=490.48s)]
*  ball. I thought he was going to clog things for Ant. I thought he was going to be someone that [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=494.4s)]
*  Ant would get frustrated with. And you did see that at times this year, but once they kind of [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=498.79999999999995s)]
*  figured it out, I mean, once the pace of the game slowed down a little bit in the playoffs, you kind [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=503.12s)]
*  of see his usefulness. He really is, he's an athletic guy who can guard a lot of different guys. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=507.44s)]
*  Yeah. He's decent in the NISO. You can't leave them open. He'll make the shot every now and again. So, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=512.0799999999999s)]
*  and he's tough. Like to Rosillo's point, they are a tough team and the Lakers are kind of soft. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=518.1600000000001s)]
*  They're a little Hollywood getting pushed around by these guys. It's depressing to see. Yeah. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=527.12s)]
*  Wow. Good culture. I never thought, I never thought Randall would learn how to not be a ball stopper. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=532.24s)]
*  I'm still not convinced. Are we sure? Rosillo, are we sure that this is a new chapter of Randall? Or [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=541.5200000000001s)]
*  is this just a phase? No, but I think what you're looking at here is, I don't know, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=547.04s)]
*  do they promise Jackson Hayes that he gets to start? Is there some sort of bonus in his contract [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=553.4399999999999s)]
*  for playoffs starts? Like literally coach's son gets to play short for dinner. And I'm not arguing [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=558.64s)]
*  with it. Like if you're a Lakers dude and you've got a pod or whatever, whoever's on TV or, you know, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=564.16s)]
*  like, hey, they get to stick with Jackson Hayes longer. No, they don't. Okay. Yeah. Like I think [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=570.4s)]
*  JJ knows what he's doing on this one, but yet they keep rolling them out there to kind of start [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=575.12s)]
*  this whole thing. So really what it comes down to is like Randall's not afraid to take it to LeBron. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=580.32s)]
*  That was one of the most glaring things in game one live. Yeah. And I went, man, like Randall [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=585.2s)]
*  doesn't give a shit. He's almost excited. He's almost too excited because then he'll barrel into [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=591.04s)]
*  him and then LeBron will get a call. So Randall just feels really comfortable because Ann is being, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=594.96s)]
*  any of the possessions that matter, Ann has doubled. Okay. And sometimes Minnesota, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=600.64s)]
*  like there's all sorts of things that I love that the Lakers did that I don't like. Like I thought [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=604.8s)]
*  D'Vincenzo was a mess tonight. Rudy, they felt bad that he didn't take any shots, I guess in game [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=608.4s)]
*  three. So they run the first fucking play for him. And guess what? He can't hang onto the basketball. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=614.4s)]
*  I would challenge anyone. There's no one that plays regular minutes that is worse with the [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=618.88s)]
*  basketball on his hands. Like a jugs machine, if a jugs machine was hanging out with Rudy, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=623.4399999999999s)]
*  the draft gurus would give that jugs machine a fifth round grade and be like, it's not accurate [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=628.72s)]
*  enough. And you'd be like, that doesn't make sense. Usually jugs machines are pretty accurate. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=634.4s)]
*  You're like, they didn't complete a pass all day. And so they still don't know what to do with the [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=638.08s)]
*  Rudy part of this. The elbow in the back of the head, LeBron was just like totally stupid in that [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=641.76s)]
*  moment. But damn, I think Randall just sees the space because you've got to still at least show [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=646.08s)]
*  to Nas. You have to show to Nas. You have to show on Conley even though he doesn't really want to [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=652.48s)]
*  shoot. And then Jaden. And so I think when there's like two guys and one retreating off of [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=656.48s)]
*  and I think Randall is just salivating at some of this stuff. And that's why, yeah, I think he's [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=661.6800000000001s)]
*  still a ball stopper, but here I don't think there's as much of a penalty for it. But he's just been [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=666.08s)]
*  over the course of his career. He's just been so bad in the playoffs. Yeah. He's been so bad in the [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=670.96s)]
*  playoffs where teams have been able to force him to his weak side, completely neutralize his scoring. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=678.88s)]
*  You just did not expect for him to contribute in any meaningful way when the stakes got to their [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=686.08s)]
*  highest. And of course he would do it now that he's skull fucking the Lakers. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=693.84s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, you must've had flashbacks on that foul against Luca because that was, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=701.2s)]
*  that could have been the game. I mean, you held up, you played defense, there's four left on the [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=706.0s)]
*  shot clock and you foul them. And he was, to his credit, he was upset with himself, not the call. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=710.08s)]
*  But then I'm thinking of you, Van, going, you must have turned to somebody and be like, this is why [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=715.2s)]
*  we got rid of that dude. You know, the numbers have always been like, look, go to basketball [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=719.44s)]
*  reference. You're like, how do you not like this guy? And you're just like, look, there's just a [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=723.6800000000001s)]
*  lot of in-between stuff that you've never really liked. So what, you know, one other thing, like, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=726.8000000000001s)]
*  like Reeves had a bad first half, right? But he has a bad first half. You don't, you don't notice [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=730.72s)]
*  there's guys that can be bad and you don't really notice for like an hour when Randall's bad. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=735.0400000000001s)]
*  You just see it, you see it on his face. His body language is bad. You're just constantly aware. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=740.56s)]
*  It's like this black cloud just goes over his head. You want to know why that's such a good [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=746.48s)]
*  point though? It's cause he doesn't stop being bad when it's bad. He's like, I got this. You're like, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=750.64s)]
*  dude, you don't, you don't. He'll, he'll fuck up three times in a row and then dribble the ball out [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=755.36s)]
*  beyond the three point line, call a defender out and just like, he's going to get in his back. And [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=761.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm like, you watching you like Randall, you still in your bag, huh? Get out your bag for a second, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=766.72s)]
*  but he'll do it anyway. But it's working. Look, you know what? You know what I was thinking as I was [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=771.2s)]
*  watching this game? I was thinking in years past, this would have been exactly what the NBA wanted. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=775.52s)]
*  They want it in a series with LeBron where young dude beats old guy and becomes heir apparent to [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=781.6800000000001s)]
*  face of the league or whatever it is. They want this. I'm wondering if they want it right now. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=789.76s)]
*  I don't think that they do. Like, you know, this, this is probably with the, with the Lakers and the [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=794.64s)]
*  Luka thing and everything. I think they probably want the deepest run for the Lakers that they [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=799.52s)]
*  could possibly get. But I mean, really all NBA fans should want the coronation of Anthony Edwards and [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=803.12s)]
*  they should want it to, for him to take it from LeBron James in the way that the, the Timberwolves [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=809.76s)]
*  are taking it from the Lakers right now. Well, the bummer is I like watching both of these teams. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=814.4s)]
*  And I feel the same about Nuggets Clippers. I just enjoy all four of those teams. And we're [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=819.6s)]
*  going to lose two and yet we're going to probably keep a couple of teams. I don't enjoy as much [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=824.24s)]
*  as we headed to round two. The thing with the Minnesota first round, I mean, even if Golden [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=829.36s)]
*  State, like the fact that these are these six teams going at it in the first round, I don't, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=834.16s)]
*  this is we're spoiled. Well, I was watching today wondering cause Golden State, I don't want to [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=838.8s)]
*  jinx it, but I think winning that game, stealing that game last night without Butler was such a [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=845.2s)]
*  good sign for them. And I'm sure they're watching a game like today. They have a couple of days off [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=849.36s)]
*  in that. All right. If we can somehow get by Houston, who would we rather play? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=854.0s)]
*  And I, after that game, I don't even know what I would tell them because yeah, the Lakers don't [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=858.72s)]
*  have a bench. No, it's definitely the Lakers. You think? Cause they know, they know there's no big [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=862.96s)]
*  version of it. Cause they could just go small ball against them the whole time. Right. Right. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=868.4s)]
*  Maybe I'm too influenced by the last time I saw them play each other where the Lakers wanted to [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=872.8000000000001s)]
*  be small. Yeah. And Golden State was like, awesome. You know, like I, whatever, whatever [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=877.76s)]
*  happened in game three, I don't know that I feel like I've seen too many minutes where they're just [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=883.28s)]
*  getting beat on by bigger guys. They still may win the game, but I don't know if they're having a blast [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=888.72s)]
*  while they're doing it. So I would think they would be afraid of what Minnesota may be capable of. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=893.28s)]
*  Capable of, yeah, the ceiling of Minnesota is higher, but you watch those two guys going at [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=898.24s)]
*  the same time today. Like I don't, I think Minnesota has a better team. I wouldn't count [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=902.72s)]
*  the Lakers out in this series yet. Like you figured they'll win game five. Then I looked [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=907.52s)]
*  already. I looked into the future. It's a 65 to 10 free throw advantage in game five. That's that. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=912.48s)]
*  That's the over under, but then game six, who knows? It's like, you know, that those, the Lakers [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=918.32s)]
*  have had some guys who have been on some big games over the years. And then you have that fear of [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=925.2s)]
*  if we don't take care of this, now we got to go back to LA for a game seven. Minnesota, I think, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=930.96s)]
*  has a better team though. I mean, I'm looking at it. I'm looking at the series and I keep waiting [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=935.36s)]
*  for the Lakers to show that they have an edge over the Timberwolves. And that moment has not come [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=940.24s)]
*  even in game two, where the Lakers get the win. It's one of those wins where you go, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=945.6s)]
*  we didn't figure very much out in that situation. Like the tailskips, a weird end game. Yeah. Like [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=952.5600000000001s)]
*  we didn't figure very much out. And it seems like when the Timberwolves need to make a play [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=958.8000000000001s)]
*  or when they need to bat down the hatches, that they have things that they can go to. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=963.2s)]
*  They have easier ways to get stops and easier ways to get buckets than the Lakers do. And the [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=967.9200000000001s)]
*  Lakers seem like they're operating on a real high degree of difficulty with everything that they're [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=973.2s)]
*  trying to do. And it doesn't seem like over the long run, they're going to be able to mount [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=977.6s)]
*  anything to tip the series back on their side. Yeah. They have to double ant. They have to [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=980.96s)]
*  hope whoever their smallest guy is and getting bullied by Rando or Nazarene or whatever. There's [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=988.16s)]
*  a lot of things that are hoping don't happen. The T-wolves basically just seem like we just have to [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=993.12s)]
*  make sure Luca doesn't get easy looks, seems to be a lot of their strategy. The Riscilla, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=997.6s)]
*  this stats interesting. Lakers shot 19 for 47 from three today. Usually if you're around 19, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1002.5600000000001s)]
*  20 made threes in the NBA, the way it is now, that's a win, right? Like 19 out of 20 times. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1009.6800000000001s)]
*  So if I'm the, if I'm JJ, I'm like, fuck, we played our five out thing. We dumped Jackson Hayes [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1016.32s)]
*  finally. I tried to get away with no bench as much as possible. We made all our threes. I got a great [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1021.84s)]
*  game from Rui. I got a huge second half from Reeves and we still lost. Now what do I do? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1029.52s)]
*  And I wouldn't know what to tell them. I don't know. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1034.0800000000002s)]
*  More Gabe Vincent? No, I don't. I mean, Gabe Vincent flying around. Sure. If you want. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1038.0800000000002s)]
*  Little more Goodwin with more just a sprinkling of Goodwin. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1043.36s)]
*  Goodwin sprinkles. Yeah. Goodwin. What exactly are Goodwin sprinkles? I think he's really [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1049.6s)]
*  competitive on defense, but yeah, he's a very big player. And so I think he's like, he kind of got [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1056.8s)]
*  what he needed. He got the game from Reeves in the second half. He had Rui off of those traps, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1063.12s)]
*  felt like he was doing everything right. They even get a couple threes, I think from [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1068.8799999999999s)]
*  Phinney Smith. Yeah, they were spacing it out really well. LeBron fucking living at the free [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1072.48s)]
*  throw line, but they were fouling him. I mean, DeVincenzo, some of these fouls that this guy [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1076.96s)]
*  will do, it's like, hey, you're not going to stop him. Like LeBron was already rid of the [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1080.64s)]
*  basketball and DeVincenzo follows through. Maybe I'm just annoyed because he argues it so much. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1085.44s)]
*  And then you go back to the replay. Like DeVincenzo is like a high school kid caught in the woods with [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1090.72s)]
*  a beer. You're like, the chances of this guy telling the truth right now is zero. Like, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1095.76s)]
*  doesn't matter what I ask him. He's just going to say, hey, dude, wasn't me. So, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1104.0s)]
*  I think there's always like these interesting three, four minute stretches where maybe somebody [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1110.4s)]
*  could hit some shots or you get some energy. I think the gamble that JJ had strictly was, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1114.72s)]
*  can my guys hold up enough physically if I do this to them? Because I don't feel like I'm [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1118.8799999999999s)]
*  necessarily bearing some other great options. And I think in a way they still kind of survived it, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1123.44s)]
*  even if I felt like off the dribble, like Ant, dude, he had a layup at 72, 63, or even for him, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1128.64s)]
*  he went through four guys. And I thought, even like my expectations of him are so high that he's [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1138.24s)]
*  going to find a way to stop, turn the corner and get by. He's going to beat two. He's going to split [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1145.1200000000001s)]
*  double teams. He's going to get the angle. He's going to beat you to the spot. He went through [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1148.8s)]
*  four dudes. So, I thought it was actually going to be worse with how tired the Lakers guys were. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1152.4s)]
*  So, maybe being tired shows up on the inbound pass that LeBron loses in that spot, down three, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1159.0400000000002s)]
*  which is kind of lost in just the melee of all the events that happened to close out this game. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1165.76s)]
*  That's a good point. Ant never plays, he always plays fearless, but he does sometimes play passive. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1170.5600000000002s)]
*  And for whatever reason, he's not passive now. Like you've seen him before the soft double comes [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1177.6s)]
*  out there and he kind of doesn't know what to do with it. You see games where he's too reliant on [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1184.8s)]
*  taking high degree of difficulty threes or high degree of difficulty long twos. You see that. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1190.32s)]
*  None of that now. And also he's playing mind games with LeBron James. He's getting into him physically. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1197.1999999999998s)]
*  These guys are rallying behind him. It's a big deal series for Ant right now. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1206.24s)]
*  For sure. That's my favorite thing. International basketball. Yet another person really helped [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1212.08s)]
*  by their experiences abroad. Yeah, but he was doing this. When he was going at Durant being like, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1216.8799999999999s)]
*  whatever the fucking belt you think you had was, this is mine. And what I appreciate is that he's [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1223.28s)]
*  qualified to do this because he's this special. And so him and LeBron going at it. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1231.04s)]
*  And then of course he got called for the foul. But granted he was on defense, but you could see [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1236.72s)]
*  that happening. It was really fun. And then they showed a replay over and over again. I think we [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1241.12s)]
*  all enjoy that stuff. Like that for me is one of my favorite things about this. And it's not even [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1244.56s)]
*  being disrespectful, I don't think to LeBron. It's that Ant, I think collectively the NBA fans would [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1250.32s)]
*  say, well, he can do it. Right. We're in Jalen Green is doing shit to guys that won four rings [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1256.0s)]
*  last night. I'm like, yeah, settled. Yeah. Wait, I mean that key point in the beginning, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1262.64s)]
*  we're so about how he did this last year too, but something feels different. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1267.36s)]
*  And I think this is what it is. When he was doing, when he made his playoff run last year [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1272.24s)]
*  and he had those 10, 11 games were like, shit, those look like Michael Jordan stats. What's [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1276.4s)]
*  going on here? The other teams weren't treating him yet. Like he's being treated this year. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1280.32s)]
*  It was just happening in real time where you're going, man, this guy's kind of amazing. Like [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1286.0s)]
*  what's, and then finally we get to the Dallas Sayers and they're like, all right, we're fucking, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1292.88s)]
*  this is over. We're now treating him like he's a guy. This playoffs, he's been treated in the, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1296.64s)]
*  in the Laker series, like he is at that level. And I think that's to me is the difference is [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1301.44s)]
*  understanding. I am now here. I'm going to be treated this way. And the way that he feels like [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1307.2s)]
*  he's on the same level as Luca and 40 year old LeBron, I feel like they're all peers. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1312.96s)]
*  I, we wouldn't have said that last year. I didn't feel like he was like Yocage's peer last year. He [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1318.3200000000002s)]
*  was just having an awesome series. You know what I mean? This year, I feel like he's peers with [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1322.4s)]
*  those guys. It ended with a, it ended kind of with a whimper, which kind of like, you know, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1326.0s)]
*  makes you forget about it a little bit. But I mean, at this point, if you're a Lakers fan, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1332.16s)]
*  or if you're the Lakers organization, we're going to have to go to some desperate measures to, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1335.5200000000002s)]
*  to get them out of here, to get them off of his game. We're probably going to have to Shannon [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1340.64s)]
*  Sharpe them, send somebody into the DMS, get them off of his game. Never heard that before. That's, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1343.68s)]
*  I'm scared. I would history. Would history prove that that doesn't get off his game? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1351.2s)]
*  Well, maybe, but it's our only shot now. Okay. We're gonna, cause he's not going to stop. So [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1357.2s)]
*  we're probably going to have to send somebody to them, get somebody, distract them in some kind of [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1363.8400000000001s)]
*  way. It's Los Angeles. There's a lot of people that we can, we can send waves and waves. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1368.64s)]
*  People might not be deep. We might tighten the rotation on the court, but as far as the rotation [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1373.8400000000001s)]
*  in Los Angeles of ladies, we can send right to them DMS to get ants mind off of the game. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1379.1200000000001s)]
*  Sweet deep. We may be, but I mean, he is prepared for the double team. We saw that in the fourth [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1383.92s)]
*  quarter. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Double, triple, maybe a different type of double team. We'll throw at him. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1389.8400000000001s)]
*  We'll see. It's the only thing we can do. Can I read you the weirdest stat of this game? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1395.12s)]
*  Luca Donchich 38 points, 45 minutes, one rebound, two assists. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1399.52s)]
*  That's a low number. It's a camp. It's a camp Thomas game. What is happening? And LeBron puts [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1408.4799999999998s)]
*  up 12 rebounds, eight assists. Whatever this version of LeBron is, is just, I talked about it [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1415.12s)]
*  a few days ago. It's this new version he's just created now where he's like a hybrid of [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1421.76s)]
*  nine different versions of him for the past. The stuff he's doing on defense, he's just stripping [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1426.8799999999999s)]
*  dudes. He's protecting the rim. He's moving his feet on defense and blocking passing. He hasn't [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1431.68s)]
*  played defense like this. I don't think since 2020 personally. Am I, am I wrong? Masilla? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1437.52s)]
*  Well, there was a stretch at the beginning of the season. I was like, okay, this is like bad. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1443.92s)]
*  We were saying he was a DH. Yeah, there was a Denver regular season game where they had him. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1448.48s)]
*  He was the low man and they just were like, we're going to run this thing and the off ball guy is [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1453.2s)]
*  going to dive down and LeBron's just not even going to bother coming over. And I'm thinking [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1457.6s)]
*  myself like, you can't possibly run a fake switch out of the closer. Like after he was supposed to [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1460.48s)]
*  go to contest at the corner, he'd like do a thing where he'd go box out a guy that was next to him [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1465.9199999999998s)]
*  and then be pointing. It's like, dude, there's no possible way you thought that I was going to go [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1471.9199999999998s)]
*  over there. Then he came back and I remember there was a Memphis game where I was like, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1475.36s)]
*  holy shit. Like what? Like LeBron is completely engaged. It's great. So yeah, this is, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1478.9599999999998s)]
*  I think a lot of the really great plays tonight were right at him. You know, the D, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1486.24s)]
*  Vincenzo drive where they come out of a timeout and you're like D, Vincenzo one on one against [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1492.32s)]
*  LeBron. The problem is D, Vincenzo is trying that fucking shot. Like that guy's never had anybody [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1497.52s)]
*  one on one thinking he's not going to make it. And he falling away from the basket, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1502.16s)]
*  lefty floater layup right at a guy. It was a high degree of difficulty. I'll give him that. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1506.3200000000002s)]
*  And then D, Vincenzo on the strip play that got overturned and credit to LeBron and the Laker [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1512.72s)]
*  staff because LeBron and the assistant looked at each other and they were basically like, yeah, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1517.1200000000001s)]
*  you found them. Like, yeah, overturned. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, D, Vincenzo gave [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1520.48s)]
*  an a grenade. Like, did you see what they did there? Like D, Vincenzo ended up getting free. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1524.64s)]
*  And at that point that might've been the first time I've ever seen that guy without the confidence [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1529.36s)]
*  to go. It's double D time, right? Cause he gave it back to him. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1532.6399999999999s)]
*  And did a crazy, I just want to be involved in this place so badly. I'm going to do a delayed cut [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1536.8799999999999s)]
*  behind you, like a trailer. Yeah, right. Just hoping it was almost like a, like a wide receiver, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1541.92s)]
*  hoping for a lateral. It was like a lateral. Yeah. And he flipped it back to him. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1546.6399999999999s)]
*  You're right about game five. No, I need to jump in here because I need to ask conspiracy bill a [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1551.44s)]
*  question. Oh yeah. It's the first thing I thought of when I was like three one, I was like this, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1555.2s)]
*  but we're both going to be there. Yeah. I knew you go to every Laker game. Now you didn't need [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1559.68s)]
*  Diane Cannon. I'm going to go on Tuesday. I love basketball. We're still there since they got Luca [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1562.96s)]
*  Roussela's he's there wearing a Slovenian baseball jacket. He's, he's all in. It's funny. Cause I've, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1568.96s)]
*  I've made it to the cool halftime lounge. And then one night I didn't have, I wasn't invited with the [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1575.44s)]
*  high end people. I was just a commoner and I hit up some stuff like, Hey, can I go, uh, can I just [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1580.6399999999999s)]
*  make sure I get that? Because if somebody wants to say hi, like, are you out of your fucking mind? [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1587.68s)]
*  You're just asking for a bracelet to the cool halftime thing. Like you have to be invited, sir. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1591.52s)]
*  Hey, Taylor Sheridan's in there. He wants to talk about 1944. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1596.5600000000002s)]
*  Rossello, but that I'll be 1944 Rossello. That's a positive though. Like, you know, so, you know, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1601.3600000000001s)]
*  where you stand and let me tell you what I mean. I have a theory, right? Cause they have all these [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1609.44s)]
*  private members clubs in LA. Yeah. The question is who's famous enough to show up at the Soho house [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1614.64s)]
*  and not being a member and just get led up. Like Will Smith is probably not a member of the Soho [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1621.6000000000001s)]
*  house. Right. But if he shows up there and goes, Hey, this is a bad example. I think, I think anyone [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1626.48s)]
*  can get in the Soho house. Whatever. Whatever. Like you, you go there, they'll, they're going to let [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1631.44s)]
*  you write up like Kevin Hart just walks in. They're like, Hey, it's Kevin Hart. Come on in. Yeah. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1636.5600000000002s)]
*  What's going to let you write up. Now, you know that you're not quite there yet. As far as [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1640.72s)]
*  all privileges, Ryan Rossello face card. It's me. Let me up. But that just makes that drive to get [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1647.1200000000001s)]
*  close though. Yeah. Right. You're right there. You're right there. You're like in the Laker series [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1653.2s)]
*  right now. You're one way in a way you're, and if they see you in the lounge a couple of more times, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1658.88s)]
*  you're hanging out with Taylor Sheridan. It's you as Jessica Alba. By the way, Kings game. I think [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1663.76s)]
*  you're in, I think you go to any Kings oilers game. They're just like, boom. Yeah. Co-patterns [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1668.4s)]
*  brother. He let me in once. He's a huge fan of the pot. You'll know somebody from, from the Bay. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1673.2s)]
*  It was just the way it happens. Van, I have a question. This is all really good. Thanks guys. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1678.8000000000002s)]
*  The hand, uh, is the league ready for Anthony Edwards to be the face of the league? Hell no. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1685.52s)]
*  No, no, not at all. Is there any reason? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Like he, he's too real for TV. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1692.16s)]
*  You think they've had meetings about this been like, what happens if this happens? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1704.16s)]
*  Yeah, they might've tried. He's, he's probably my favorite basketball player since Kobe. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1708.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm telling you, I love them. I love the real. I really do too. I love the fact [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1716.4s)]
*  like I love the fact that even the shit that happens off of the court, which some of it is [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1722.4s)]
*  really fucked up and stupid and like just really stupid, but even that he just doesn't let it, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1727.92s)]
*  let it bother him. Even when he kind of looks like an asshole or something, he just doesn't let it [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1735.0400000000002s)]
*  bother him. He doesn't let it bother him. Um, and there's something to be said for someone who is [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1739.8400000000001s)]
*  not hung up on every single opinion that people have about him on social media is a Hooper and a [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1746.4s)]
*  dude. I would say something else, but I'm in mixed company, but it, it, it just, I think you could [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1753.92s)]
*  say it and a, and a, and a, and a dude. And so I dig that, you know, it hurts watching them do it [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1760.8000000000002s)]
*  to the Lakers, but I like him, but no, they are not ready for Anthony Edwards to be the guy that [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1769.76s)]
*  they're building their league around. They're not ready yet. Well, I think he's ready because you go [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1775.36s)]
*  through that. Think about this Gauntlet, Rossello, if he can finish off the Lakers, he's finishing [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1780.24s)]
*  off LeBron and Luca who are now in the same team. Then you would go next round, Steph, Draymond, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1784.7199999999998s)]
*  Warriors. And that's before you even get to the third round. Or a man, Thompson Van Vliet. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1792.24s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just saying if, if it's a Warriors, you'd be able, you'd be going through two of the [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1797.84s)]
*  league's icons back to back before you even got to the 68 win OKC team that just swept Memphis. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1801.68s)]
*  It is now 72 and 14 on the season. It's gone. And then the Celtics are somebody else waiting. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1808.88s)]
*  He went to rant Jokic last year. Right. Yeah. But these are that, they, we're now in the icon [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1816.16s)]
*  territory though, especially- Sure, but it's been not a year and I still can't believe they beat [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1822.96s)]
*  Denver in Denver game seven the way they did. I can't believe that. That to me is still one of [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1827.44s)]
*  the most unlikely. I think all this stuff's accurate. I have no pushback or further commentary, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1833.76s)]
*  but I still have to ask conspiracy build this question. Because during game two, when you were [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1839.8400000000001s)]
*  like, the Lakers are going to be called for a million fouls, they're going to even the series. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1845.28s)]
*  And I think I pushed back on some of that stuff with you. And then when I was watching games, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1849.44s)]
*  Bill was right. It was right. But the thing- Yeah. Everybody had four fouls and [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1853.44s)]
*  like the five minute mark of the third quarter. Right. But more free throw attempts from Minnesota. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1857.68s)]
*  So you'd have to think that people would love for the series to be two, two. They had a chance to [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1863.12s)]
*  just not overturn that call. Is it too obvious with the Skyhawk cam from above? They just, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1867.68s)]
*  they couldn't, they couldn't do it. I'm surprised. How did they not cut the feed of the Skycam? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1873.52s)]
*  Like, it's not working. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1878.8s)]
*  Nope. I will say this would be a very tough game for, for Minnesota on Wednesday, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1884.3999999999999s)]
*  because also the LA, like the crowds good and the crowd, the crowd does affect the refs a little [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1891.36s)]
*  bit, you know, and you have LeBron and Luca who are the two of the better ref workers, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1896.0s)]
*  you know, as the game goes on and you combine that with the fans. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1901.44s)]
*  That's so funny that you think that I think Lucas terrible at it. I think he's annoying. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1905.2s)]
*  No, is he bad or good at it? He's just so annoying about it. And he's, he's it to have to watch [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1910.48s)]
*  like Luca to be a Lakers fan and have Luca come here. The one thing I hate is bitching more than [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1918.3999999999999s)]
*  anything I hate bitching, which is crazy. Cause I'm one of the world's leading bitchers, but, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1923.12s)]
*  but I hate it when other people do it. Right. Tremendous self-awareness though, man. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1929.6799999999998s)]
*  It is what it is. But I hate it when other people do it. So I don't think that Luka works, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1934.56s)]
*  works the rest very well. I do think the Lakers will win. And then I think they will be smacked [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1939.4399999999998s)]
*  in game six. I don't think game six will be very well, I'll tell you this. You want to give me, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1944.08s)]
*  you want to give me a guess the line bill. You want to guess the line. Oh, I haven't looked yet. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1947.4399999999998s)]
*  I would say Lakers by two and a half for a game five minus two and a half minus two and a half [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1952.48s)]
*  Lakers. It's minus five and a half. It's the same line as game two. Wow. Interesting. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1958.32s)]
*  So they're with you. Like it feels like I thought it's Wednesday night. I know, but I saw like, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1964.32s)]
*  I just felt like with the matchup, if you get five and a half with Minnesota, you had to do it. But [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1970.32s)]
*  then history has also told us that the game one home loser wins game two. I think leading up to [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1974.32s)]
*  last time I said it, the team that lost home game one was 19 and four in game twos and one 15 and [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1980.08s)]
*  19 by double digits. I don't know what the game five down three one history is for a team. What [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1986.0s)]
*  do you think the series line is? Do you look? Cause I just looked, I didn't T Wolves or minus 500 [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1992.0s)]
*  Lakers are plus three 85. Ooh, you, you sound like you have way more Lakers hope in you than I, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=1998.72s)]
*  than I imagine. I wouldn't say it's hope. I just think when you have two guys that can put up points [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2006.8s)]
*  like that, I think it's different. Like if Orlando we're taping this as Celtics game is that like, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2010.96s)]
*  if Orlando goes down three one, like they can't score, they have real issues. Like it'd be really [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2016.32s)]
*  hard to put together three wins. I think it's a little similar to what had to happen for them in [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2020.48s)]
*  2016 when they had LeBron and Kyrie, they fell down three one, the league did the ridiculous [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2025.76s)]
*  technical on Draymond that ends up getting him suspended, which is still the worst thing, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2032.0s)]
*  the worst league decision of this century. But then those guys just went off the next two games. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2035.92s)]
*  Remember LeBron and Kyrie. And that would be my fear if I'm Minnesota, like how do we make sure [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2040.64s)]
*  those guys don't combine for 80 points? And LeBron, I guess, is just not going to get tired [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2044.96s)]
*  at all during this playoffs. It's, it's, uh, you can't count on like, oh, he's old though. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2050.08s)]
*  This will be an old legs game for him. He's just not, not having them. So, um, let's, uh, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2055.04s)]
*  let's take a quick break and then we'll talk about the draft. This episode is brought to you by [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2061.84s)]
*  Mickalob Ultra. Spring is here. My favorite time of the year. That means the NBA playoffs [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2065.44s)]
*  are here too. What am I the most excited about? I'm excited to see if the Celtics can defend their [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2072.08s)]
*  title. I'm excited to see if Steph Curry and Jokic can keep going and going and going round after [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2076.2400000000002s)]
*  round. I'm excited for the potential of an LA versus LA playoff series. It's never happened. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2082.48s)]
*  Clippers Lakers never in my lifetime. Is OKC for real? Is Cleveland for real? Is SGA going to prove [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2088.4s)]
*  that he is the best scoring guard in the postseason? Basically since Michael Jordan, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2094.72s)]
*  since Kobe Bryant, is he on that level? We're all going to find out. There's plenty to look [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2100.8799999999997s)]
*  forward to on and off the court. Like Mickalob Ultra court side. That's another thing. It's getting [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2104.8799999999997s)]
*  fans closer to the game with unique prizes. Plus they're giving you a chance to win tickets to the [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2109.2s)]
*  NBA finals. You heard me. The NBA finals, which I hope are in Boston, just head to [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2113.2s)]
*  Mickalobultra.com slash NBA finals. Mickalobultra court side NBA finals sweepstakes, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2118.08s)]

*  The draft. Rossello was just in his house yesterday with the McShay crew breaking it down [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2145.52s)]
*  for two hours. Sanders dropping all the way down to the Browns, hijacked the draft in a lot of ways. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2151.36s)]
*  It hijacks. It hijacked my text with Van Lathan. Yeah, for sure. It it ended up in a really, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2158.4s)]
*  really weird, goofy place where Cleveland passes on him. It felt like 20 times and then finally [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2166.56s)]
*  took him and they cut to the war room and nobody in the war room seemed like remotely excited about [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2174.16s)]
*  it. So you almost made you wonder if it was an owner decision. But I wait instead of talking [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2179.04s)]
*  about the oh, how could this have had blah, blah, blah. Like there's a bigger picture question of [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2184.0s)]
*  when this happens, why does it happen? So you have some thoughts, Van? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2189.6s)]
*  You mean this should do a Sanders situation. Yeah. When somebody drops like this and it's all for the [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2194.7999999999997s)]
*  there's the sports talk reasons for it and then there's the actual reason. So let's have the [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2200.08s)]
*  conversation. So I had a guy, a very high up football guy hit me and when he heard me on your [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2203.76s)]
*  pod the last time after day one and it was interesting the way he put it, I'm going to read [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2212.32s)]
*  this. He goes on Shadoor. He's never been graded that high by the scouts, which is something that [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2218.5600000000004s)]
*  I don't think a lot of people are paying that much attention to. When you hear about Shadoor Sanders, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2222.48s)]
*  you're about media assessments. He goes, he was a creation of the media, but mostly a creation [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2226.8s)]
*  of the machine built in Boulder. Then you have to ask yourself with the organization, do you want [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2231.2799999999997s)]
*  to deal with his father criticizing your staff every week from his CU press conference, your [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2236.24s)]
*  backup and if you're the, if you're, if he's the backup and your starter has a bad week, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2241.12s)]
*  do you want to have to respond to what's being said a thousand miles away? It's a lot of baggage [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2246.24s)]
*  that's surrounding an average player. So I think people are trying to make it either or they're [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2251.52s)]
*  trying to make it a completely cultural thing or a completely football thing. When really what I'm [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2258.2400000000002s)]
*  hearing from people that are involved in the NFL, that it's a combination of the two, that if Shadoor [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2264.5600000000004s)]
*  Sanders were more of a can't miss prospect, then you probably wouldn't have be having a lot of the [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2270.88s)]
*  conversations around him that you're having. But if he's just average or just good, I mean, not [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2274.96s)]
*  transcended, just average or just good, then the things that come along with it and we can't act [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2281.2000000000003s)]
*  like that there's not going to be more scrutiny with drafting him. There just is. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2286.48s)]
*  Hula blue. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2293.36s)]
*  Hula blue. And a lot of people, it scared them off. And so look, I think there are a lot of people [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2294.64s)]
*  that are going to take what happened with Shadoor and they're going to use it for their own interests, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2300.88s)]
*  whatever agenda that they have. I think that Shadoor Sanders is a much better quarterback than [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2305.52s)]
*  a fifth round quarterback, but also I'm not an NFL scout. I'm a guy that watched him in college [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2310.4s)]
*  and I'm starting to realize that a lot of these guys don't care about that. They really don't care [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2316.32s)]
*  about your college tape. The assessment that they do of you starts, it's partly because of what you [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2322.88s)]
*  did in college, but then it's really the measurables and the stuff that they get and all different [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2329.44s)]
*  types of things that they're watching beyond that. So I don't know, we're going to have a lot of [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2333.76s)]
*  conversations about this, but I think there's a lot of stuff going on. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2338.8s)]
*  That's my guy, Will Campbell, who you told me dominated everybody for the entire time he was [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2342.4s)]
*  at OSU and then did the measurements and his arms were an inch short. So then it's like, I don't know, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2348.2400000000002s)]
*  he might be a guard, but you told me nobody got by him ever at OSU. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2353.52s)]
*  He was the best pass blocker I've seen at LSU in years, maybe ever in terms of just a guy that [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2359.28s)]
*  just, I mean, we didn't run the ball that well. I mean, we had some problems in the interior line [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2365.2000000000003s)]
*  and all that stuff, but Will went up against the most athletic, determined pass rushers in the [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2369.2s)]
*  country. When you talk about SEC pass rushers and they just simply couldn't get around him, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2375.52s)]
*  couldn't get to his quarterback. But when it came out, they looked at the measurables and they're [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2379.12s)]
*  like, Oh my God, maybe we have to move this guy around. So, you know, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2382.7999999999997s)]
*  when Rossella and I talked, we love the NBA draft stuff. We did the redraftables and it's so fun to [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2387.4399999999996s)]
*  see how teams miss on guys, right? Like Brunson was somebody we all liked in college and then he [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2392.3999999999996s)]
*  goes through the process and it's like, Oh, he's too short. What is he? Is he a two guard? [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2397.92s)]
*  And then he falls to like 32 and it seems stupid. With Sanders, he's clearly not a fifth round pick, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2401.6s)]
*  but I do understand. Like here's an example, like Jacksonville, right? Jacksonville is not very good. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2408.8s)]
*  They took Hunter already who we played with. They have Lawrence who were not positive. Lawrence [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2413.44s)]
*  is ever going to make it as like a real guy who's going to win playoff games. And we get to the [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2418.96s)]
*  fourth round with Jacksonville. And it's like, this seems like a logical candidate to be like, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2423.84s)]
*  you know what? Fuck it. We're going to take Shador Sanders. Let's say, and we'll have, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2428.08s)]
*  but here's why can't you do that for Jacksonville? Because the moment you do that, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2432.4s)]
*  everybody's like, Oh man, Oh, could he take Lawrence's job? And then the moment Lawrence [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2436.48s)]
*  has three picks in week two, then it becomes should Shador play, should he get a shot? And [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2441.6800000000003s)]
*  Rossella, I just don't think, I think there's like 20 teams that are just like, we don't want [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2447.36s)]
*  to deal with this. We don't want to deal with all the shit he plays, should he not play, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2450.88s)]
*  we'd rather just take this other guy. Unless you're a first round or who you feel like needs a [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2453.92s)]
*  little seasoning for the most part, NFL coaching staffs want backup quarterbacks to be seen and [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2459.04s)]
*  not heard. And this has never been a sport that wants free thinkers. Like the early Belichick [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2465.28s)]
*  stuff was great because he just immediately had Brady brainwashed and then everybody kind of [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2471.2000000000003s)]
*  followed the lead. And then Bruce he was like totally into it. And it was like, you're not, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2475.52s)]
*  you didn't come to Foxborough to be a free thinker. Ask why it's like, this is what we're [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2479.92s)]
*  going to do and go ahead and execute it. So it's like the Shador, the Shador tape, I'll tell you [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2484.48s)]
*  what, this is a lesson in just the group think when it comes to mock drafts, like I've got the [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2489.92s)]
*  speech years and years ago from an NBA GM, just going at the drafts would be so different. And he [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2493.92s)]
*  was obviously an NBA GM because draft would be so different if there were no mocks. He's like, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2498.64s)]
*  but eventually you start like letting the mock break your own tie. Because you're like, well, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2502.88s)]
*  if I do this and I get it wrong, everybody's going to think I'm stupid. But if I take this guy, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2506.96s)]
*  like it is kind of crazy too. Like you'll see somebody who's projected to go 13th in the first [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2511.92s)]
*  round of the NFL or NBA. And then if he goes eighth, it's like, holy shit, are those guys dumb? [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2517.04s)]
*  It's just, I mean, especially the NFL side of it. It's like, I don't know. Like it's that big of [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2523.84s)]
*  a reach because I took a guy six spots higher than all the stuff that you keep reading over and over [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2528.56s)]
*  again. Where the other thing that happens with all these mocks is everybody kind of ends up just [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2532.64s)]
*  looking at everybody else's and goes, I don't want to seem like a complete wild card for all [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2536.32s)]
*  this. However, having said that, I've never seen anything like this. Right. Belichick. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2539.52s)]
*  Belichick was the only one who's like, I like Cole Strange. He didn't look at a single buck. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2543.76s)]
*  I just like him. We're not going to talk about that. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2547.76s)]
*  I think this is the most dramatic thing that I've ever seen from this. But after the combine, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2553.36s)]
*  two teams that have high picks that you could argue could have been in on a quarterback, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2557.1200000000003s)]
*  met with Shador. They were like, absolutely not. We've heard the giant story with Brian [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2561.52s)]
*  Dable and him getting into it. So look, if he was special, okay, if he truly was special, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2566.08s)]
*  but the mocks had us believing he was special, the mocks had probably him believing he was special. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2572.4s)]
*  His father had him believing with special, which was really nice. His dad was there to support me [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2576.8s)]
*  the entire time. It feels like he went into this. He went into this thinking like, I don't have to [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2580.16s)]
*  say shit to you guys. And these guys looked at the film saying your film is like average. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2585.92s)]
*  And now you come in here with this entitlement. It's just not going to work. This is just not the [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2590.8s)]
*  way an NFL locker room would ever, they would never sign up for something for somebody that [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2596.0s)]
*  they think is fairly replaceable. It may never even be. Look, there's plenty of first rounders [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2601.2000000000003s)]
*  they're going to completely whiff. So I feel bad in the sense that, again, he shouldn't have been [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2605.44s)]
*  a fifth rounder. So I could be really mean about this and say, hey, he brought it all on himself. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2613.44s)]
*  I think it also proves that Dion has zero relationships with decision makers in the NFL. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2618.48s)]
*  No agent, hey, we're doing it our way. It's going to be non-traditional. I don't know if the league [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2623.12s)]
*  decided to punish him for it. I think a lot of people just said, hey, I don't know that I want [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2626.72s)]
*  this. I don't know that I want this in my QB room if he's not really, really special. And I think [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2630.88s)]
*  everybody kind of agreed on that without a conclusion. Yeah, I think Dion is beloved by [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2636.72s)]
*  the media. Rightly so. He's been a major star for the last 30 plus years. As far as the [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2642.64s)]
*  football culture decision maker guys, I don't know if those relationships and sort of how he's [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2651.2s)]
*  revered, if that carries on there. I think that we're probably all seeing that now. I will say [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2657.8399999999997s)]
*  this though. Remember back when we was on the bus one time and this girl had tried to holler at [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2662.3199999999997s)]
*  this guy who was in high school and he didn't like her. And then he went around to everybody [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2668.64s)]
*  in school being like, hey man, Tush tried to holler at me. Tush tried to holler at me. Tush [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2675.6s)]
*  tried to holler at me. And after a while we started asking them like, why are you telling all of us [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2681.3599999999997s)]
*  that she tried to holler at you? Why is it getting around the whole school that you don't like her? [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2686.48s)]
*  The thing that I was struck by with Shadoura Sanders is the amount of negative experiences [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2692.0800000000004s)]
*  and highlighting every single negative thing that was wrong with him got to a fever pitch in a way [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2700.6400000000003s)]
*  that I don't remember seeing. And I think the question is like, why is that happening? [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2706.2400000000002s)]
*  Was that happening because Shadoura Sanders was such a notable and forward-facing athlete? [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2711.52s)]
*  Was that backlash from all of the rapping and the chains and all of that stuff? Was that a [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2717.52s)]
*  referendum on Dion? But it did turn negative in a way to where we're hearing, I looked up all of the [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2726.64s)]
*  old interviews, the interview stories that we've heard of. And typically when we hear an interview [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2734.08s)]
*  story from the draft, we've heard about bad interviews. But when we hear about bad interviews, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2738.16s)]
*  we normally hear about bad questions from franchises. We hear about somebody asking you [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2741.76s)]
*  if you're gay or somebody asking you about something with your mom or somebody asking you that. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2748.48s)]
*  We don't hear really about how a prospect whiffed an interview as much as we've heard about this bad [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2753.6800000000003s)]
*  interview with the Giants. And I can't put my head around why that is. Either that's people [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2762.32s)]
*  saying that, okay, he's a fifth round talent or a second or third round talent, and he did [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2769.52s)]
*  terrible in his interview. Let us explain, let us quell the outrage and explain why he's not being [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2775.52s)]
*  drafted. Or there was some kind of hate for the kid that in some way they didn't have for other [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2781.12s)]
*  prospects based upon something outside of his control other than how he acts and carries himself. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2788.48s)]
*  You also have probably 10, 11 teams total are going to be in the pool to take them. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2795.36s)]
*  Then individually, each team talked themselves out of him for whatever reason, the most surprising [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2800.88s)]
*  me in Pittsburgh. But I do wonder, is a piece of this, you draft, like you have the coaches, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2806.2400000000002s)]
*  one of the people in the decision making room in every room, right? You know, if you draft him, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2811.12s)]
*  I think was one of the reports, I think Schefter said this, he reported like there's a coach that [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2816.56s)]
*  would be worried that the moment you bring this guy in, it's going to be just nonstop. Dion's [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2821.76s)]
*  going to replace, he's going to be the next coach. He's going to coach his kid. And I do, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2827.0400000000004s)]
*  we know that coaches can sabotage this shit in subtle ways, but we're still the only bad interview. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2830.96s)]
*  We've heard some bad interview stories with the NBA stuff. The only one I remember hearing [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2836.88s)]
*  was the Lamela one when, when, um, when team the team start, he tanked the interview because he [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2841.5200000000004s)]
*  wanted to go somewhere else that other than that, I don't, do you remember many interviews [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2847.92s)]
*  stuff with NBA teams? Yeah, I do. Like, I don't know, I'll just pick a name out of a hat or [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2852.08s)]
*  cause I go to the combine. Like I'd heard Jake Larravia wasn't the greatest hang in a meeting. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2856.64s)]
*  All right. Went in the first round. Guess what? Nobody gives a shit about Jake Larravia's [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2861.6800000000003s)]
*  sit down with the team because it's Jake Larravia, right? It's Shador. And so I understand [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2866.96s)]
*  being your point, like we talked about this at such a level that it felt uncommon, but I do think [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2873.2s)]
*  if you're on it every year, like I'll hear from McShea over the years, be like, Hey, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2882.56s)]
*  what happened to that guy? And be like, Oh, he sucked. He sucked in his interview. He sucked [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2886.88s)]
*  on the whiteboard. Like he was totally lost. I don't know that anybody ever cared enough [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2890.24s)]
*  for us to talk about it as much as we are with Shador because you know, it's, it's, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2895.12s)]
*  I don't know. Like I want to ask you this question. I kind of want to ask you this question [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2902.64s)]
*  because I know that like we'll see what happens Monday on the TV shows and everything, but race [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2905.52s)]
*  became a topic with this thing. And I get, and I always feel like, all right, when I see the guys [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2911.04s)]
*  arguing that it is about race, a lot of times that guys, the guys have seen it doing it. I'm like, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2917.2s)]
*  shit, I don't want to be like aligned with that guy. But if there's one field that I feel pretty [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2921.2799999999997s)]
*  comfortable talking about it's sports, right? I think that NBA and NFL decision makers are [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2925.92s)]
*  probably the most forward thinking of like, Hey, if you can play and you can help my team, [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2932.16s)]
*  like this is how I'm going to evaluate you. So I'd ask, is there, is there ever a chance that with [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2936.8799999999997s)]
*  Shador, it can be about Shador and not about a race? So, okay. So a lot of people say race [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2941.8399999999997s)]
*  and they mean culture, right? Yeah. I mean, correct me where I need to be corrected. No, no, no, no, [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2953.44s)]
*  no, I'm not talking about you. So a lot of people say race and they mean culture, right? [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2958.48s)]
*  It would be, it would be silly to look at the draft after a quarter, a black quarterback went [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2962.3999999999996s)]
*  number one and went NFL owners are, they don't want to draft black players, right? That's not the, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2968.72s)]
*  but there is a thought that there is a specific type of black player or black man that is a [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2978.7999999999997s)]
*  specific affront to power structures. And that's someone who doesn't walk in and isn't artificially [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2986.16s)]
*  humble, who doesn't walk in and doesn't mute himself is big in a room and is lighting up a [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=2994.3999999999996s)]
*  room and knows that he has it, that there's a specific feeling from some people that that guy [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3002.56s)]
*  has to be broken down and cut down a peg, right? It's interesting when I, when I was listening, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3007.8399999999997s)]
*  when I was watching Shadour Sanders, I was thinking about Adrian Broner and a lot of people aren't [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3013.52s)]
*  going to be able to make this connection. Adrian Broner is a legitimate four weight world champion, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3017.2s)]
*  like a legitimate boxing achiever. However, in order for him to carry the type of bravado that [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3025.28s)]
*  he did with him, he would have had to have been perfect. If you're going to be Floyd or if you're [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3033.44s)]
*  going to be Ali or if you're going to be Dion Sanders, you can almost never lose. You have [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3037.92s)]
*  to be perfect because if you are not perfect and you have that type of confidence and that type of [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3043.92s)]
*  bravado and that type of oomph with you, then they will cut you down. And so when people are saying [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3049.2000000000003s)]
*  race, they're talking about black man, they're saying black man, but they're not really talking [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3055.44s)]
*  about black men. They're talking about one specific type of black man. And it's the type that they [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3060.6400000000003s)]
*  seem to always want to go at when they're trying to make an example of someone. Now, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3066.16s)]
*  I'm not necessarily saying that that's what's happening with Shadour Sanders, but there's an [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3071.3599999999997s)]
*  uncomfortability and attention there because of what we've seen happen to athletes like this [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3076.3999999999996s)]
*  in the past. Now, if you got the goods, it don't matter, right? Because all of the guys I was just [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3082.3999999999996s)]
*  talking about, Dion, Ali, whomever you want to name, and if you got the goods, it don't matter. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3087.04s)]
*  But it does kind of seem like sometimes they want you to, if you're black, they want you to be great. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3094.48s)]
*  They want you to be amazing, but they don't want you to put it in their face. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3100.8s)]
*  You know what I mean? But once again, how much, how much of that has to do with the position he [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3104.48s)]
*  plays and what people seem to expect from the quarterback position when you're talking about [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3109.2s)]
*  leadership, commit charisma, calming force, guy who lifts up your teammates and they're looking [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3114.96s)]
*  at him and it's like, if this guy's going to carry himself a certain way, but doesn't have the [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3120.56s)]
*  talent to back it up, it's almost like counterproductive. The second part is, the second part is the entire [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3125.2s)]
*  part of it, right? Because, you know, I'm a huge LSU fan. Nobody had more swagger than my vanilla [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3130.48s)]
*  champion, Joe Burrow. Nobody had more swagger. We smoking cigars. Yeah. We this, we flipping the ball. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3137.92s)]
*  We boom, boom, boom, boom, the whole thing. By the way, saw him at the Lakers game in person. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3144.24s)]
*  Beautiful. Stunning. But we also threw 60 touchdowns, right? We threw 60 touchdowns. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3150.64s)]
*  We won the Heisman. We got to the league. We, I know, I've never met the dude. We, he took a team to the Super Bowl. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3158.32s)]
*  I like we. I'm proud of we. Right. So, so that's the whole deal. So there's two parts of it. The first part of it is, [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3163.6s)]
*  I think a lot of people, two people, the conversation is this. Is he good enough [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3171.04s)]
*  to comport himself in the way that he does? That's the first question. The second question is, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3175.6s)]
*  does he have to be? Can't he just be confident about himself? Can he just be happy to be [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3180.56s)]
*  Shadour Sanders? Can he just be, he ain't never been in no trouble. He ain't never, does he have to [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3185.92s)]
*  be as excellent as people would want him to be in order to be as big as he wants to be? [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3192.08s)]
*  You know what it reminds me of a little bit? I'm going to do something really dangerous. I'm going [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3198.56s)]
*  to use a cross racial comparison. Oh Jesus. This is, I'm a veteran. Here we go. You're not going to say [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3202.64s)]
*  Marshall Henderson, are you? Oh shit. Oh miss. See, that's what I'm talking about. Do you know this? [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3209.04s)]
*  Do you know, do you know that guy personally? No, I'm talking about Bill. Do you know who he's [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3216.56s)]
*  talking about? I know the name. I don't know that. I don't get the reference. That was my favorite wife [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3221.36s)]
*  for many years. Did you, right bro, for old miss had a see, see, see for old miss had like a checkered [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3226.8s)]
*  story, had been to a Juco or whatever, whatever, or been to a different school, just used to come [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3236.0s)]
*  to open, would shoot 39% but score like 35 and flip off everybody in the crowd. I loved that guy. I [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3240.96s)]
*  can't believe you just pulled that name. I was, I was going to say Adam Morrison and here's why. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3250.16s)]
*  Okay. Because he had that really fun college season that everybody enjoyed. Then he flamed out in the, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3256.0s)]
*  in the tournament and he cried in the court and it became a thing. And then it was, he became one [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3263.4399999999996s)]
*  of the most polarizing prospects in a while. And some people were like, that guy's not athletic [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3267.52s)]
*  enough to be a starting small forward in the NBA and be able to score. And other people were like, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3271.9199999999996s)]
*  you got to look at his history, look at the college, look at all this stuff, the big game and all the [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3277.12s)]
*  carrying a team, all the same stuff. And then Charlotte ended up taking him third, like they [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3282.24s)]
*  bought into it and he was a bust. But it's the same kind of thing where the fans are seeing one [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3286.9599999999996s)]
*  thing because they're like, no, no, no, no, he did this. And I watched this game in Gonzaga at 38, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3292.08s)]
*  which is a little like watching Colorado on a Saturday night and be like, no, no, that game, [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3297.6s)]
*  the 53, 52 game. And he was awesome. And then all the diehard NFL people were like, he doesn't have [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3301.2799999999997s)]
*  it. It's barely a starter. Best case scenario, Teddy Bridgewater, maybe Andy Dalton. And it [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3307.12s)]
*  just didn't jive with what I think the general public saw. Right. Am I crazy? [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3313.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think the public, I think almost feels like it was the public, was it the media? Was it [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3317.6s)]
*  also the Sanders family? Like did everybody fall into some trap of like, you know, look, I still [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3327.04s)]
*  don't think he should have been fifth rounder. I don't think he should have gone behind Millrow. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3334.56s)]
*  I definitely don't think he should have gone behind Dylan Gabriel. How about the 26 year old? [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3337.8399999999997s)]
*  You went behind that guy, Taylor, Tyler Show. Yeah. So to the Saints. Yeah, I don't know. Some [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3341.44s)]
*  of the football guys really like Chuck so much during the pre-giraffe process. No, I had Quincy [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3350.4s)]
*  Avery on who works with all these guys. Yeah. Really young age. And man, Quincy like, damn, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3355.92s)]
*  Quincy came on the pod was like, hey, if his name was Chidora Williams, he's a sixth rounder. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3362.32s)]
*  And even I was like, well, you know, and I've known Quincy a long time and respect the hell out [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3366.96s)]
*  of it. Like I got done with that pod and I was like, he hates, he fucking hates that dude. Like [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3371.6s)]
*  that's what I was thinking. I don't know that anybody nailed it the way he maybe there's other [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3376.0s)]
*  people. Delaney Walker had it pretty good too. Yeah. Yeah. He did too. He did too. Yeah. Right. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3380.08s)]
*  Titans tight in there. So I guess, you know what I would say? And like sometimes I feel like it [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3385.92s)]
*  should be good news that it may have just been a football evaluation. Like what if it was just [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3394.08s)]
*  about this football tape and what if in his job interviews, he just didn't do a very good job? [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3398.96s)]
*  Like, wouldn't that be better news? That's what it was. And then sometimes I just like, I see [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3404.88s)]
*  some of the comps like, oh, Eli Manning. It's like, yeah, I don't know. Arch called his shot [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3409.92s)]
*  and he got away with it. And Eli was this consensus number one fucking. Right. Everybody thought he [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3415.04s)]
*  was good. There's no, no one can compare Eli the prospect to even if the mock screwed up the [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3419.76s)]
*  Chador thing and Colin Howard, our friend Colin, who had the, what was the Pittsburgh trade? TJ [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3425.92s)]
*  Watt, somebody else and two first. That was a bad one. It's okay. It's okay. Hey, be nice to my guy. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3432.0s)]
*  I love it. I love it. So this is what I'll say. First of all, I'm one of those weird people that [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3446.32s)]
*  talking about this stuff just doesn't make me angry. Right. Because even if it's not the thing, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3452.7200000000003s)]
*  or if it is the thing, it doesn't hurt us or it's no skin off our neck from just talking about it. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3457.6800000000003s)]
*  Right. Like investigating the culture, investigating the things that might be undergirding these [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3462.2400000000002s)]
*  topics, whatever, just don't be so precious about it. Talk about it, whether it is or whether it's [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3467.28s)]
*  not. I think we're probably learning in a real way that the NFL minds just weren't as high on [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3471.6s)]
*  Chador Sanders as a football player as the rest of us were. And that's a real thing. Right. That's [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3478.4s)]
*  that can't be denied. I think that's the one part of this that cannot be debated. It doesn't mean [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3484.56s)]
*  it's the only part of it, but it feels like a pretty significant part of it. Can I add one piece [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3489.2799999999997s)]
*  to that? It doesn't seem like anybody thought he was a definite starting quarterback because we know [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3493.04s)]
*  this because the Steelers who literally don't have a quarterback were like, yeah, even we don't think [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3498.96s)]
*  he's a quarterback. But it also seems like teams were a little worried that he'd be a good backup, [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3503.52s)]
*  which is the whole point. If you're taking a quarterback, you want somebody who could be [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3509.52s)]
*  the backup. He's in the room. Maybe he can play. Maybe he has the upside to be a starter, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3513.28s)]
*  but he's just going to be able to fit in. And as we're so said earlier, you don't really want [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3519.76s)]
*  to hear from this guy that much. It's going to be on the bench with a headset, tell him what's play. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3523.12s)]
*  And obviously teams felt like even that seemed like a tall task for him. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3527.68s)]
*  Cleveland ends up taking him. They have the weirdest quarterback room, I think, in the history of [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3532.3199999999997s)]
*  football. I don't know if you've seen the list. It's like it's just bonkers. But really, the search [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3536.0s)]
*  is only beginning because now out of him and Dylan Gabriel, one of those guys isn't going to make the [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3543.6s)]
*  team. You know what I mean? Like it's one of those guys might go to the practice squad. I would say [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3547.9199999999996s)]
*  Kenny Pickett. Maybe I hope he's renting an apartment would be my guess. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3553.92s)]
*  Well, they can IR Deshawn so they could carry the fourth one because I guess so. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3557.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And look, I'm not trying to correct you. I'm playing out all the different scenarios. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3561.6800000000003s)]
*  You could be right. But I think there's some creative math there because I think the Deshawn [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3566.56s)]
*  part of it is to try to get the insurance money. You know, have an IR year and then that way the [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3572.16s)]
*  policy covers. Can we talk about the most important story of the weekend though? The Patriots fucking [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3577.2000000000003s)]
*  nailing a draft and get an A plus on Bleacher Report. We get an A plus. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3581.68s)]
*  Is this the only time you've ever liked Bleacher Report? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3585.8399999999997s)]
*  It's the only time I've liked a Patriots draft. I think this century where I've just felt we [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3588.24s)]
*  didn't do one thing that made me go, wait, what happened? Why do we even Van was like every time [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3592.8799999999997s)]
*  we took an OSU guy, Van was like, I love that guy. Well, that's my guy. Well, first of all, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3598.3199999999997s)]
*  people think I'm a homer. I'm very honest when it comes to the LSU. I know. That's why when you were [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3604.24s)]
*  excited about each guy we took, it made me more excited. The only guy you guys missed on Mason [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3607.76s)]
*  Taylor, he ends up going to the Jets. I think he's going to be a Jason Whitten type security [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3612.5600000000004s)]
*  blanket for quarterback. I think he was on the list. The OSU running back fell to 38, I think. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3618.7200000000003s)]
*  They didn't even interview him. They just took him. But I am shocked and I hadn't been following it [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3623.44s)]
*  as much because once again, I'm a college ball lover. That's another thing about Shadur. I'll [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3629.2000000000003s)]
*  just say this before I get like, I watched him get annihilated. Not miss. Tough as can be. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3633.92s)]
*  Because of injuries. Tough. Make throws, stand in there, stare defenses down and just make plays [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3642.48s)]
*  and make throws. And I'm like, that's what you want out of a QB. I've also watched him like [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3651.52s)]
*  98 yard drive to tie the game, the two minute drill. That's what you want in a QB. And I guess, [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3656.56s)]
*  I wasn't seeing the ball rotation right or whatever. But Braden Swenson from LSU. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3663.3599999999997s)]
*  Fifth round edge rusher. Yeah. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3670.88s)]
*  Eight and a half sacks, a legit hell raiser. You guys get him in the fifth round. I have no idea [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3673.12s)]
*  how Braden Swenson fell to the fifth round. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3680.3199999999997s)]
*  We got a long snapper and a kicker. My dad was like, I talked to him this morning and usually [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3682.24s)]
*  the first 50 minutes would be like, I don't know what happened in the second round. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3687.92s)]
*  We took that guy there who's coming off the tournée seal or whatever. He was [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3691.52s)]
*  delighted. What was the biggest shock for you Russo in the draft in general? Is there anything [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3695.28s)]
*  that stupefied you? No, I just want to stay on Swenson here for a second because here, [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3701.36s)]
*  Whit Weeks are the two best players on that defense all year long. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3705.28s)]
*  Absolutely. I mean, Swenson just consistent edge pressure of the edge guys, because Whit [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3708.4s)]
*  plays in the middle. Braden, just even as the season went on, it just got better and better [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3714.08s)]
*  so I don't know if it's because he's older. I don't know. He didn't run a 40. We were trying [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3720.56s)]
*  to figure it out the other day. The live show, he may not like normally, hey, I don't want to run a [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3725.28s)]
*  40 or they couldn't figure out why he had one. I know there's probably some other part of it [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3730.32s)]
*  that I'm missing, but again, fifth round just seemed crazy, but it's also probably the deepest [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3733.76s)]
*  position in the entire draft. I mean, low, there's guys going to the third round. I love this draft [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3738.16s)]
*  kind of like from the beginning in the second round on just how many dudes in the second round [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3743.44s)]
*  where I'm like, I love that guy. That's another guy that I love. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3747.52s)]
*  A ton of running backs, like third, fourth round range. Right. It's like really deep in certain [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3751.28s)]
*  spots. I know. I still don't really care. Like I know everybody's on this running back thing [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3756.4s)]
*  because Genti goes as high as he did because the Saquon just did what he did for the Eagles. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3760.16s)]
*  But I think he'd be making a huge mistake now deciding to prioritize all this stuff. So yes, [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3763.92s)]
*  I agree with my friend Van here. Trevion Henderson, you probably thought was going to be a top 10 pick [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3767.84s)]
*  after freshman year after freshman year. You were like, who is this dude? Cause her, he was [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3773.2s)]
*  putting a little extra on his name in the beginning cause he knew the deal of how special he was when [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3780.64s)]
*  he showed up to Columbus. And I can always, I think I have, I speak pretty fluent Herb street [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3785.2799999999997s)]
*  cause I've been listening to him for so long and you know, all the years traveling with those guys [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3790.3999999999996s)]
*  as well. And he just was like in awe of him. And then Judkins comes in this year and I actually [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3794.16s)]
*  felt like even though Judskins had the flash, like Trevion was, was still the dude in a way, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3799.84s)]
*  even if the momentum, you know, dumped off that a little bit, but I love Mason Taylor. And I know [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3805.1200000000003s)]
*  it sounds like it's just two LSU fans going at it here. Taylor, they went away from him at LSU [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3810.32s)]
*  because they had NFL wide receivers all over the place. And he is not only fast and huge, [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3815.28s)]
*  he's a fucking baller. Okay. And when he needed to fight and compete and all that kind of stuff, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3822.2400000000002s)]
*  like I didn't have to question any of that. I think if he had been somewhere that didn't have [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3827.84s)]
*  as much wide receiver talent, he was like their desperate third down option. I don't know that [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3831.52s)]
*  there's any of her version of Mason Taylor lasting to the second round, but the tight end class was [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3835.44s)]
*  loaded. I just kind of wish she was, I wish she was Drake Mase target for you. Cause I don't, [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3839.6000000000004s)]
*  I think he was the backup if Henderson wasn't there, to be honest. I think that was, they wanted to [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3845.28s)]
*  get her weapon. They weren't going to take a wide receiver. No, I mean, he went like what, [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3850.48s)]
*  four picks later, three picks later. It was right in the vicinity. It was a mutual. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3854.56s)]
*  I give Henderson a lot of credit though. I give Henderson a lot of credit because [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3858.7999999999997s)]
*  I give Henderson a lot of credit because he, when they brought in Quincyon Juckins to split carries [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3863.44s)]
*  with him, I was like, Jesus Christ, what kind of bell cow bellwether back, like wants another guy. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3872.7999999999997s)]
*  And Juckins had had some injury problems at Ole Miss and it wasn't quite, but he, everyone that [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3880.08s)]
*  had watched him in the SEC knew that he could flat out play. But Henderson handled it really, [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3886.4s)]
*  really well. Never complained. He was probably psyched he didn't have the extra miles going on [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3891.84s)]
*  him before he went to the NFL. I'd be delighted. It might've cost him in draft capital though, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3897.04s)]
*  right? Because the guy had had such an amazing freshman season that if he sticks around a little [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3901.44s)]
*  bit longer and continues to put those numbers up, then maybe he's a high or mid first rounder. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3906.56s)]
*  You know? We have to wrap up because I want to watch the Celtics game because right now it's [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3912.0s)]
*  443. But I have to ask you guys this. Should I be worried about Belichick in this girlfriend? [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3916.08s)]
*  I'm not. I'm opening my show. I don't even care. It's the NBA playoffs draft recap. I'm starting [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3922.32s)]
*  my Tuesday show. I've got 15 minutes on this. Oh, okay. All right. Unbelievable. No, no, but go [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3926.88s)]
*  ahead. Give me your thoughts. Well, I mean, for me, Belichick's like a family member. You know, [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3932.16s)]
*  it's like he's like my uncle. He's like, he's just part of the fam. And I feel like this woman is so [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3936.8799999999997s)]
*  crazy. Like I, I, I just scared for him. I want to talk about your timeline with Belichick because, [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3942.0s)]
*  and I'm sorry to interrupt, but after that Apple doc, you've never been closer with Belichick. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3947.2799999999997s)]
*  You've gone on the offensive in defense of him. I noticed that I know there's a real tone out of you. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3952.3999999999996s)]
*  I really appreciate him. Did he frustrate me during the draft? Sure. Was he a barrel [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3959.44s)]
*  lobster in the press conferences? Not really. Did we win six super bowls? Were we awesome for 20 [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3965.44s)]
*  years? Yeah. I love Belichick and I'm worried about him. Okay. Give us your worries. Give us [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3971.68s)]
*  your concerns. Cause I'm Zachy. Oh, you're Zach. Let me hear this Zach before I get my concerns. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3977.04s)]
*  Okay. The things that that young woman must be doing to build Belichick. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3983.04s)]
*  You guys are worried about him. I'm happy for him. Curling toes. Like I'm happy for him. Belichick [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3989.6s)]
*  got ready. It's Bill fucking Belichick. It's Darth Vader in a hoodie. He got, he got ready to answer [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=3995.28s)]
*  a question. She said, no, we're not talking about that. And she's using we with everything. Bill [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4003.92s)]
*  Belichick stood down, turned around and looked like this. Like, like a step for Belichick, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4012.0s)]
*  a step for Belichick. But the stuff she must be doing to Belichick must have his just blowing [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4019.28s)]
*  his mind. He's got to be happy. He's got to be happy. It reminds me of when Katie Holmes started [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4026.72s)]
*  dating Cruz and we all started getting worried for her when she started become, when she got [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4032.72s)]
*  Stepford wives by Cruz, all the senators like, Oh no, we got to save Katie Holmes. I just went [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4036.96s)]
*  that video of her in the high heels, walking on the football field. Belichick is Katie Holmes here. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4044.56s)]
*  Belichick is Katie Holmes. That's important. That video of her going on the field and ordering [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4050.32s)]
*  people around, like she was a party planner at a wedding. And it's like, it's spring scrimmage. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4055.76s)]
*  What are the people at the school think of this? And did you see that she shut down somebody who's [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4061.28s)]
*  printing Belichick t-shirts and she like shut the account down? I just, it's not good. We've seen a [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4066.24s)]
*  lot of these over the years and this one doesn't feel like it ends that well. How does it end? [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4073.04s)]
*  Not well. A breakup? Yeah, like a breakup. A tell all book. And I just, I just want Belichick to- [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4079.04s)]
*  The ones that don't break up, they're just roommates. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4084.7999999999997s)]
*  Just want them, I just want them to win some games at UNC. I was looking forward to, [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4088.4799999999996s)]
*  you know, I casually root for LSU because I like my friend Van. I was excited to root for UNC. I [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4092.4s)]
*  was actually excited for this college football season. Now I'm worried our guy Belichick is in [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4097.12s)]
*  trouble. Anyway, Van- If I was a UNC booster, I would be worried after this interview. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4101.76s)]
*  Like what are we dumping our money into? Oh, it's Sunday morning. Okay. Look, just one comment on it. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4106.96s)]
*  Here is Bill who has never let anybody tell him how it's done. No. Ever. Not even in [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4111.4400000000005s)]
*  Robocraft. Right. Like if there's one thing we know about this guy's like I'm doing a team photo, [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4119.36s)]
*  fuck you. Oh, video game. Nah, you know, whatever the petty shit I can do. Oh, that's a new petty [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4124.719999999999s)]
*  thing I can do. I'll do that too. Like just- He would have signed OJ Simpson in 98. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4131.12s)]
*  Absolutely. Right. Absolutely. That's Patriots way thing. Cause they got rid of one lineman in the [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4136.96s)]
*  late nineties. For a woman who's 24 to tell him, you know, and this wasn't panhandle- [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4141.36s)]
*  She's four years older than my daughter. Right. How does she beat Connor Willa online? You know, [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4149.5199999999995s)]
*  this is, she's off to the side. Like you went on fucking CBS. What'd you think this was going to be? [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4156.32s)]
*  Like, you know, you went on to promote your book and it's CBS. This isn't after another win to go [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4163.36s)]
*  11 and two on the season. And somebody from the fucking Boston Herald's like, Hey, what were you [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4173.28s)]
*  thinking with that last time out? But you say he's, he's 72. I would be worried if this was [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4179.12s)]
*  Rossello in his late forties. And it was like, did you hear about this girl Rossello's dating? [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4187.84s)]
*  Yeah. She doesn't get on Lyft anymore. I'm not being too critical of the relationship [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4193.04s)]
*  because there is, there is a scenario, right? I'm not talking about the ages. I'm talking about the [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4197.2s)]
*  uprooting the life part where it's with this Belichick, this mystical figure who never seemed [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4202.400000000001s)]
*  like this would ever happen to him. And it's happened. He was wearing a distressed Navy pullover. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4207.04s)]
*  Okay. But that might be in that he may have paid for that. Those abrasions. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4214.16s)]
*  He was wearing a distressed Navy pullover. Like I'm telling you, man, it, this is just the beginning [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4218.16s)]
*  of it. Bill Belichick, TikTok is coming. The whole situation is coming because she is putting it on [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4225.28s)]
*  his motherfucking ass. That's what's happening right there. Be happy for him. Six times Super [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4234.48s)]
*  Champion Bill Belichick getting it put on his ass. He's going to have a TikTok. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4240.639999999999s)]
*  I hope in the title he's going to be doing like dancing videos where he's dancing with his six [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4245.28s)]
*  rings. Like what is happening? All right. Thanks guys. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwV0wMDleNo&t=4248.799999999999s)]
