# Bill Simmonsâ€™s Most Improbable NBA Stories of 2023 | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [February 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzw_vZQffro)
*  All right, guys, I asked you to prepare for a draft because people love drafts.
*  We're going to draft the most improbable 2023 NBA stories so far.
*  We're 60 games into the season.
*  You can define improbable any way you want, but I would kind of veer toward this definition.
*  If you had told me blank in September, I would be stunned.
*  So, Chicoby, we'll give you first picks since you're our guest.
*  We haven't seen you in a while.
*  And you produced House Eats 3, one of the most important pieces of pop culture
*  of the last 20 years.
*  You go first.
*  I mean, first of all, I like to consider myself the director of House Eats 3.
*  Producer director.
*  Just producer director.
*  Showrunner.
*  Tarantino.
*  Yeah, showrunner.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Okay, I bet we all have something to say about this.
*  So I'm glad I had the first pick.
*  I'm honored and it's very polite of you guys to allow me to have this
*  spotlight in the first pick in the draft.
*  And my first pick in the draft that I did not see coming in September.
*  If you were to time travel back to September, me and tell September me
*  that the Grizzlies have turned heel and they're unlikable.
*  I would be like, what?
*  Let's just over the past month, we have John Moran being like, I'm not concerned
*  about any team in the NBA except for the Boston Celtics, the Malika Andrews.
*  Dylan Brooks punches Donovan Mitchell in the penis like a direct targeted penis punch.
*  And then we have, oh, I don't know.
*  There's some incident where the Pacers are playing against the Grizzlies in Memphis
*  and the Pacers are getting into it with some of John Moran's friends.
*  And then there's a laser pointed at the Pacers that they're getting on the bus.
*  The NBA has to spend time and money investigating this alleged laser.
*  Was it a gun incident?
*  Was John in the car?
*  Whose car was it?
*  And then they're arguing with Shannon Sharp in LA.
*  It's honestly like it's a script.
*  It's like, what happened?
*  This team in the playoffs was so much fun, so likable.
*  Remember after every game last year, they would win a game on League Pass.
*  And I would stay watching that game just to watch the postgame interview
*  because they turned it into a party.
*  They were the most fun, the best chemistry, the best group,
*  and they've turned completely heel.
*  I don't know how this happened.
*  I don't know how the Grizzlies became unlikable.
*  I don't know how it happened.
*  Please explain to me because I know you guys had this on your list as well.
*  House, I had this in my top three.
*  It wasn't my number one pick, but it was in my top three.
*  I don't understand how it happened either.
*  I've never seen a team go faster from Young and Lovable to
*  just Giant Bullseye on their back against everyone they play.
*  Everyone they play is like completely pissed off at the Grizzlies.
*  And it's kind of fun.
*  I like it.
*  But usually like the basketball we grew up with, House,
*  you usually at least, I don't know, made the conference finals
*  before you started carrying the swagger.
*  This has been unusual to watch a team that really hasn't done anything,
*  carry themselves like this.
*  This is, this is, I'm not going to say a bad thing about Ja,
*  but they've taken on his personality.
*  And I think it all begins and ends with him.
*  He has supreme confidence and he plays that way.
*  And I'm happy for it.
*  The thing that remains the open item, they needed another adult.
*  Like Stephen Adams clearly is super important to that team.
*  And poor Verno keeps telling us to wait till Stephen Adams comes back.
*  Then we'll start, we'll see a semblance of offense at the end of games.
*  They'll settle them all down.
*  He'll be the adult in the room.
*  The only acquisition they made of the trade deadline was Luke Kennard,
*  who is a fine piece, a good shooter, but I don't think he's going to be an adult in any room
*  that the Grizzlies is going to give a shit about listening to.
*  They needed another like player with some gravitas.
*  That was my view going into the trade deadline.
*  And, you know, Dylan Brooks is the best agitator in the league.
*  I mean, he was openly provoking Harden the other night.
*  It was wonderful.
*  I could not have enjoyed it anymore.
*  He brought like a little side out of Harden.
*  I was watching that when that happened.
*  I don't think I've seen Harden mad more than three times since like the 2000s.
*  Have you seen Harden display any emotion, whether it be joy or sadness?
*  I can't tell.
*  He's got the whole beard just covers his whole head.
*  We've seen some pictures of him at Delilah's.
*  He looks pretty happy.
*  When you say adding somebody with gravitas, to me, it doesn't even have to be a player.
*  They could add Sterling K. Brown.
*  Just have them come in and give like this is us speeches in the locker room.
*  Samuel L. Jackson, you know?
*  Yeah, I'm with you.
*  We still love the Grizzlies so much that we're going to Memphis and we're going to eat barbecue
*  there for two days in March.
*  I love the fact that they have positioned themselves as the agitator, but it does feel
*  like it's been counterproductive to them a little bit because since that Shannon Sharp thing,
*  they've really kind of unraveled and you could say, oh, it's Steven Adams.
*  I just find it hard to believe that Steven Adams is that important.
*  All right, House, you go.
*  You have a second pick.
*  I thought this was a very hard challenge because it's much easier to go through
*  the probable stories of this year.
*  Oh, coming into the season, will K.D. or Kawhi play 55 games?
*  No, I don't think so.
*  Will Kyrie sabotage the Nets?
*  Yes, that's probable.
*  Not improbable, but probable.
*  Yes.
*  The $250 million man in Washington, will he deliver a team that's 500 better?
*  No, that's probable.
*  All those things are hard.
*  Improbable and really seizing the mantle for the most lovable team in the entire NBA,
*  like the motherfucking beam.
*  It's the Sacramento Kings.
*  Not only were we bullish on what they showed us on paper coming into this season,
*  we were all over.
*  They're over in terms of their win total this coming season.
*  We thought that there was a beautiful chemistry experiment underway that they could really
*  make something happen.
*  By golly, they did it.
*  And not only that, they like each other.
*  And not only that, they play all the fucking games.
*  There's no load management in Sacramento.
*  Look at how many dudes have played at least 50 games on that roster.
*  It's wonderful.
*  And they came up with this spectacular gimmick.
*  Light the beam.
*  I'm all about it.
*  God bless the VEC and God bless the Kings.
*  They are 35 and 25.
*  House, we did our over under pod with Priscilla.
*  And our big boost that we did for FanDuel, which seemed, you know, we weren't sure about it,
*  was Nuggets 50 plus wins, Bucks 50 plus wins, and Kings 35 plus wins.
*  They boosted from plus 320 to plus 450.
*  And we all like the over with the Kings, but it's still the Kings.
*  They haven't made the playoffs since 2006.
*  They've hit the over.
*  They're at 35.
*  They have 20 games left.
*  They're at 35 plus.
*  I had that.
*  That was my second pick.
*  Sacramento becoming a competent NBA franchise.
*  It's been so long.
*  Like think like Jacoby, you and I have known each other since 2006.
*  It feels like I've known you my whole life.
*  We've only known each other since 2006.
*  That was the last time.
*  That was the first year the Kings didn't make the playoffs.
*  So that's how long it's been for them.
*  I went through longest playoff droughts, which everybody knows Sacramento 16 years
*  since they made the playoffs.
*  The next team is Charlotte with six.
*  And then the next team is Cleveland with four.
*  So they are almost three times as long as a playoff drought as anyone else in the league.
*  That's incredible.
*  And then last round one playoff series win.
*  Their last one was 2004, which was the same as Minnesota.
*  So that's almost 20 years.
*  Charlotte's the leader 2002 is the last time they won a playoff series.
*  Congrats to them.
*  Detroit's 2008 and Orlando's 2010.
*  That's everybody that hasn't won a playoff series in 2010.
*  So just them getting in the playoffs with potentially a game seven at home.
*  Jacob's.
*  I mean, did you watch that Cooper game?
*  Would you stay up for it?
*  It was the game of the year.
*  I sold my tickets because we had like a monsoon here and I could have been there.
*  It was the game of the year.
*  Absolute game of the year.
*  Insane.
*  And my guy, Mike Muck, over the Bulls last year, the beginning of the season,
*  it was like they started out really hot and they had these new pieces.
*  And you were like, OK, I could smell that one kind of falling apart.
*  Yeah.
*  And I can't lie.
*  I did feel the same way about the Kings.
*  And now I was wrong about that.
*  Like I was I was watching King's Thunder tonight a lot more than I was watching Timberwolves
*  Warriors.
*  Yeah, because they're just those are two fun teams to watch.
*  They're not just competent.
*  You had them as a competent team.
*  They're a fun team, a young team, a team I want to root for and House really touched
*  on the most important part.
*  They've got a gimmick.
*  They've got a gimmick.
*  It's like Dave Coulier with Cut It Out.
*  They've got to light the beam gimmick like they've got like they've got a bit.
*  They've got a gimmick they can go back to and it fucking rules.
*  Remember the Celtics when they had Gino dancing on the Jumbotron and it was like,
*  it felt like it pushed them up a level that they had this old 70s disco dig guy
*  with long arms dancing at the end of a win.
*  Gimmicks are great.
*  Anytime a gimmick seems authentic and the team's winning and it's actually working.
*  Just an amazing the fact that it was 16 years for presidential terms basically,
*  but they finally did it and that game the other night.
*  The way Fox is playing right now and some bonus who I have as third team on the center
*  right now 20 games to go.
*  And then a bunch of shooters you expect Keegan Murray will get better as the year goes along.
*  I wish they had made a trade at the deadline, but maybe maybe they just didn't want to upset
*  the apple cart.
*  Kendrick Perkins who as you know will come in on on Twitter with the with the fire of
*  a thousand forest fires.
*  He said today Mike Brown was the front runner for coach of the year.
*  And I mean, first of all, the take burned my eyebrows off.
*  So I had no eyebrows left, but then I was thinking like that's ridiculous.
*  And then I was thinking like, well, who is the coach of the year?
*  Who is?
*  Maybe it's an insane take.
*  I don't know.
*  I also have to mention Kevin Hoerter who I've always liked in Atlanta
*  and they've unlocked they've unlocked Hoerter who's just I just I just love his game.
*  Something about him something about his his whole I can't really put my finger on it.
*  What it is.
*  All right.
*  He's a he's a white guy from America.
*  That's what I like about him, but he's amazing.
*  The the Mike Brown piece.
*  I don't know.
*  I can't top it house.
*  I can't think of another coach of the year.
*  Well, I'm not going to step on it.
*  Is it Missoula who was barely a coach who's like the number two assistant?
*  Well, there is a connection.
*  It's Will Hardy from my humble.
*  Oh, going 30 and 31 31.
*  Yeah, and a team that should make the playoffs, I think.
*  All right here.
*  I'm up on the clock.
*  Here's my most improbable 2023 NBA story so far.
*  Markel Foltz is a better trade asset asset and guy to have on a team than Ben Simmons.
*  That's an absolute fact.
*  On February 26th, 2023, if we were still able to trade and Orlando got called by Philly or by
*  Brooklyn and they said we'll trade you Ben Simmons for Markel Foltz, Orlando would say no.
*  If we were doing a draft of players, Markel Foltz will go ahead of Ben Simmons.
*  It's what were the odds of this, Jacobi?
*  This would have been 30 to one three years ago.
*  Ben Simmons made the all NBA team at age 23 in 2020.
*  He was 13 on NBA as a 23 year old and now he's the 13th man on the Nets.
*  I we all had Ben Simmons on our list somewhere.
*  I love what you did because I forgot that Foltz and Simmons are sort of linked in this way.
*  I remember when Orlando extended Foltz early, after one year, I was like, what are they doing?
*  He was hurt at the time.
*  They know more about Foltz than I do.
*  They've seen more of him and his work ethic and his practice and his rehabbing.
*  They see something in Foltz that I did not and this is what they saw.
*  People always talk about the young Foltz and they don't mention Foltz.
*  Foltz has been great.
*  I love defense.
*  I think people forget that's 50% of basketball.
*  I've always loved Ben Simmons because he, like me, is a mentally weak basketball player.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Just easily shaken, confident, miss one shot, don't want to take another one.
*  But I didn't see this coming from Ben Simmons.
*  Now he's saying he's not healthy, but I didn't see anything like this from Ben Simmons.
*  And the coaches in press conferences being like, I don't even know what to do with this guy.
*  That does not help against trade value at all.
*  But I did never consider if Brooklyn called Orlando and said, I will trade you
*  Foltz.
*  You trade me Foltz and I will trade you Ben Simmons.
*  They would say no.
*  They would.
*  Has which Ben Simmons are you buying going forward?
*  Brooklyn Ben Simmons or my Ben Simmons?
*  Oh, I mean, you're Ben Simmons.
*  Very close.
*  I think my Ben Simmons is coming on now.
*  He's like at least like 10 to one underdog now.
*  I'm just very sad about it.
*  Like we spent a lot of our time and energy on this podcast this year trying to figure out where he
*  can go to get a fresh start because he needs, I honestly wonder if he should leave the country,
*  if he should go play in Australia or New Zealand or something for a year.
*  Wow.
*  Find himself.
*  He's walking away from too much money.
*  He can't.
*  I understand.
*  I got it.
*  But like he needs, he needs a kind of life reset.
*  Like the last two years have been miserable.
*  Jacoby, let's hear it.
*  I got it.
*  Take a week off.
*  Join Aaron Rodgers on a trip to Peru, Iowasco for four days.
*  Ben Simmons comes back like the old Ben Sims.
*  Darkness room?
*  Because you know what?
*  What about it?
*  Can we throw the darkness room in too?
*  Why can't we double do it?
*  No stimulation room.
*  Iowasco in the darkness room.
*  In a shaman, the whole thing.
*  Have the shaman sit behind him on the bench all year, whatever it takes.
*  But I remember when he said he was going to play this year in Brooklyn, I was like,
*  this is the perfect spot for Ben Simmons.
*  They need defense.
*  They do not need him to shoot.
*  They've got Kyrie.
*  They've got KD.
*  This is the ideal situation for him.
*  They need him to run in transition where he is one of the best passers and finishers.
*  They need him to catch and dunk and they will set him up with wide open, easy looks.
*  This is going to be perfect for him.
*  They're bad at defense.
*  He's good at defense.
*  He can guard all five positions.
*  He'll be guarding the best player.
*  This is the ideal basketball situation for Ben Simmons.
*  And then they started playing basketball.
*  I mean, you could argue it's the ideal situation now.
*  They have a million wings and a couple long centers and they,
*  and he could be the point for them.
*  It's really a shame.
*  I hope he figures it out because I really thought he was such a unique player.
*  And I was a big fan of his.
*  Like all the stuff he did, I really liked.
*  It's sad to watch.
*  He's only 26.
*  All right.
*  Most improbable, 2020 NBA stories draft.
*  Jacoba, you're up.
*  Okay.
*  Bill, your kid's a little bit older.
*  House, your kids are kind of my age.
*  Encanto is a very big Pixar film.
*  No one talks about Bruno is sort of the most memorable song from that.
*  And for the fourth pick in the improbable stories that you would never tell me draft,
*  no one talks about email email.
*  You doka.
*  Remember he started coaching the Celtics.
*  They sucked.
*  Right.
*  And then he coached them.
*  They beat the Bucks in seven.
*  They beat an Eric's bolster led heat in seven.
*  They go to the finals, lose to the Warriors.
*  He is the hottest thing in coaching.
*  And then there's this controversy, which we don't get a lot of details about.
*  So he's just gone.
*  And then there's a rumor he was going to coach the nets.
*  I have a theory that like Adam Silver was like, let's not do this.
*  You know, it's like, let's not do this, but no one talks about email.
*  You doka.
*  If you think about the teams in the NBA, the 30 teams, which teams would be better with email,
*  you doka as the head coach.
*  Why isn't this discussed?
*  Why doesn't a team hire email?
*  You doka.
*  And who will he coach next year?
*  I just think that I'm surprised it's an improbable story to me that he is not
*  more of a discussion topic and a potential head coach.
*  When you look at someone like Quinn Snyder, who just got signed today to coach the Hawks,
*  no, you don't his name, not even mentioned.
*  Why is that the case to me?
*  There's an improbable story to not expect to play out this way.
*  Yeah, that's fair.
*  I think, I think everybody's been told hands off till the summer,
*  but I think he will be one of the top coaching candidates this summer.
*  I don't know.
*  What's your take house?
*  Do you have a take that we can run on a podcast?
*  His name was associated with what the nets were going to do, right?
*  Wasn't he?
*  Yeah, that's going to be a Hawks for a split second.
*  But yeah, but, but so it must be the case he's under contract with the Celtics still though.
*  Right.
*  He hasn't that contract hasn't been terminated.
*  Yeah, I think it's terminated at the end of this season because they,
*  they announced Missoula was the full-time coach.
*  I don't need to be overly legal about it.
*  It's not like the contract matters if they really wanted him to go somewhere.
*  I guess it must be the case that they were giving him a one year cooling off period
*  and then he'll come back.
*  I mean that that's an end.
*  He will be in demand.
*  I hope that Washington gives him a long look.
*  Cooling off.
*  Parrot.
*  I'm going to lay off that one.
*  All right, house here.
*  You're on the, you're on the clock.
*  Yeah.
*  So I think it, this one might, might straddle the line between probable and improbable,
*  but I just like to congratulate the Los Angeles Clippers for ruining the NBA regular season
*  because no team is more responsible for shining a giant spotlight on how little
*  many players, many organizations care for the regular season, for the fans.
*  They will take perhaps an outsized hit and I'm giving it to myself by virtue of the way that
*  they've staggered Paul George and Kawhi Leonard's minutes all the way up to this moment.
*  But every instance since the beginning of the season when they were playing that stagger
*  that guys sit out for reasons that are not obvious, it goes back to me,
*  the Clippers and they are paying the price for it.
*  This is a team that is barely 500, a little bit above 500.
*  That was supposed to be a contender to win the Western Conference, a potential NBA finalist.
*  They just brought on Russell Westbrook.
*  He single-handedly sabotaged a game in which they were up by 14 points
*  with four minutes left in the fourth quarter.
*  He was the missing piece.
*  Yeah.
*  And they, you know, trying to experiment with pieces at this stage of the season
*  because you're barely above 500 because you rested
*  your most important players for most of the season.
*  It's disrespectful to the rest of us and I think they murdered the regular season.
*  I had them as a side one of just that anyone would go on to Russ Westbrook as the final piece.
*  The fact that they played that card, I thought was astonishing.
*  I just didn't understand that at all.
*  I just, I just don't get it.
*  I don't, I don't fundamentally, I've been watching basketball my whole life.
*  I don't get it.
*  I just don't.
*  I don't think he's a guy who could be on a basketball team playing more than 25 minutes
*  a game that can win four straight playoff rounds at this point in his career.
*  As the game slows down, as things get closer, teams are just going to back off him and he's
*  going to have to shoot, which is basically what Sacramento was doing the other night.
*  Kawhi had this insane shooting performance and they still lost.
*  And I just, I don't get it.
*  Jacoby just fundamentally don't understand it.
*  The only thing that makes sense to me is if they just use him as a regular season rental
*  and then in the, in the playoffs, he's got that role come in in the second quarter.
*  And if you make three shots, then we'll, we might consider you in the second half.
*  I mean, I can't, but I do have faith in Ty Lui.
*  But he still thinks he's a great player though.
*  Like, like you can't, you can't accept that if you still think you're like an all NBA
*  player, which I genuinely think he does.
*  I still think he thinks he's really good.
*  Of course he does.
*  But I think I have faith in Ty Lui.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I think that he will, he will manage this.
*  It's really about Kawhi Leonard's health and abilities more than Russell Westbrook's impact.
*  It's funny.
*  You have, you have more faith in the Cooper fans too, because they're super frustrated
*  with Ty Lui right now.
*  Like I think that there's a huge break between how the national media and the fans think of Ty
*  Lui versus how the Cooper fans who watch this team, like Terrence Mann, who I think all the
*  Cooper fans are really in on.
*  And there are all these advanced stats of when he's playing with Kawhi and Paul George,
*  like they're like borderline dominant with the per 100 stats.
*  And he played the 18 minutes the other night in the double overtime game.
*  So I think people are looking at going, you're going to play Russell Westbrook, who the Lakers
*  are trying to trade for a year and a half over this guy Mann when it wouldn't, this has clearly
*  been our third best player anyway.
*  House, I have a, I have a Clippers related to what your pick was.
*  Same for me.
*  Most improbable story for me, six pick of the draft.
*  I'm really fed up with Adam Silver.
*  Hey now.
*  Yeah.
*  I, I just think the league has a lot of problems right now and it feels like a league that's kind
*  of missing, missing the parent.
*  It's like an absentee parent league where, you know, where is he?
*  Where was he an all-star weekend when we took this all-star game, which granted was never great for
*  the last 20 years, right?
*  It got the competitiveness started to wane and wane and wane, but we always had the fourth
*  quarter.
*  We always had like, you felt like they were moments.
*  It was fun to watch.
*  Now it's like just a layup line.
*  It fucking sucks.
*  The whole weekend sucks, but the, the player just guys not playing, people not knowing
*  who's going to play from game to team.
*  Somebody told me this story.
*  They went to a Laker game the other night and they were in the, in the kind of runway at the
*  top of the stairs when you're about to walk down.
*  And it was like the game had already started and there was a kid who was decked out in LeBron
*  stuff and the dad and the son had just gotten there.
*  And the, the person who I heard the story from said to them, wow, you love LeBron, huh?
*  And the dad said, yeah, I hope he's playing tonight.
*  And his kids wearing like all LeBron stuff.
*  And it's like, that's kind of this point we've arrived to at 2023, when you go to games or
*  you're going to bet on a game or whatever, and you just have no idea who's going to play.
*  And I, to me, it's like, I just, David Stern, I had a bunch of issues with, I think he really
*  tailed off the last eight, nine years of his career, but he still had some wins.
*  He had a lot of losses, but I just feel like he would have really cared about this.
*  And I don't feel like the league does.
*  And we, as we've talked about this before, but I'm just regurgitating it.
*  What do you think, Chicoaps?
*  Well, a couple of things.
*  I can't take my kids to games because it's too expensive.
*  Like that's another thing.
*  It's like, I, like I went down to Washington to House's hood with, with my son, Quincy,
*  just the two of us, we were going, I looked at the prices for a wizard's nix games, right?
*  Just looked at the prices.
*  Couldn't take them.
*  It's insanely expensive.
*  Right.
*  And then I think everyone talks about player empowerment, player empowerment, player movement.
*  That doesn't bother me as much as players not playing does.
*  And I think, Bill, one thing that you know, and I know is this is sort of a contract year
*  for the NBA too.
*  Like the rights deals are going to be up soon.
*  So this is when you should be looking your best.
*  You know what I mean?
*  This is a contract year.
*  These next two seasons are contract years for the NBA.
*  And I think if you are Adam Silver, you should be smart enough to know that you want to look
*  your best when you go into meetings with streamers and with networks and say, give me billions and
*  billions of dollars for our products.
*  It he's he's in the Godfather where they have the peacetime conciliatory versus the wartime
*  conciliatory.
*  And I think he's been a good peacetime conciliatory, but now he's got to be a wartime
*  conciliatory a little bit here because I think there's some real stuff happening with the league
*  that's starting to mirror for very different reasons.
*  What the late nineties were like when fans just had a lot of issues with whatever was going on
*  with the amount of money people were making for how they treated the product on the court.
*  And you go to these games and somebody who's making 50 million a year and it seemed like
*  they didn't give a shit.
*  And now it's like a different version of that where people think it's okay to just,
*  I'm not playing tonight or teams are like, yeah, I'm not going to play this guy.
*  Like, why hasn't what happened to Shay Gilder's Alexander the last two games?
*  Okay.
*  So he's like, yeah, we're going to, you know, we're going to sit him out.
*  Like, I, I just, I don't like it.
*  And if you're going to devalue the regular season, then we have to come up with real
*  ideas for how to change the regular season.
*  Maybe we have to think more soccer style and go 60 games or something like that.
*  So that the regular season games are just more important where you have to play because
*  you have, you know, a much smaller sample size.
*  I don't know what the answer is, but the answer is in play 82 games
*  and everybody's going to miss 20 to 25 games who matters house.
*  Well, and, and, you know, we, we went through this just in the last handful of, of, of days,
*  the Portland trailblazers on the, the, the first game after the all-star break
*  encountered a snowstorm trying to get from Portland down to Sacramento.
*  They made it.
*  They, they were going to play.
*  They decided to rest Jeremy Krant and Dame like how many times in a year,
*  runway, like imagine telling Oscar Robertson that story.
*  Oscar Robertson was like transferring planes four times to go from like Syracuse to Cincinnati
*  and then just going on the court and shitty shoes and playing 48 minutes.
*  Well, and think if you're a fan of Sacramento and you want to see one of the hottest players
*  of the last, like, you know, 30 games, Dame dollar might drop 50 on any given night.
*  We just got hot off the press.
*  Dame had 71 at home.
*  We just found out against the Rockets as we were recording.
*  They didn't play the other night was awesome.
*  The all-star game took a game off.
*  One, the three points shooting contest and then could have been his first game should
*  have been in Sacramento, but took the night off for, for reasons.
*  I, I, I still don't understand it, but I'm interested.
*  Here's why I think they're going to care.
*  Sorry to interrupt your house because like the ratings for the all-star game,
*  the whole weekend was absolutely atrocious and there's regular season ratings are way down.
*  And, you know, you could say part of that is, uh, well, you know, the playoffs are fine,
*  whatever, but I, I think it's a combination of the way kids and younger people consume the league.
*  Sometimes they're not even watching the games.
*  They're just going to YouTube.
*  Like I don't, is Quincy a fan Jacobs or no?
*  Not really.
*  Yeah.
*  Like Ben Simmons is, I would say he's somewhat of a fan, like knows what's going on,
*  but would never sit and watch a basketball game with me, but feels like he can follow
*  it through TikTok and YouTube.
*  And what should really worry the league is what happens when those kids grow up and now
*  they're the people who would spend money.
*  And are they going to spend money when their whole habits their whole life has been to not,
*  not actually sit through a game.
*  And if you're de-de-de-de incentivizing them from, from, I don't know, caring about the
*  regular season.
*  I just don't know how that's good.
*  There's no upside at all.
*  Well, they, um, so good.
*  So they need less games.
*  We all know what the answer is, but the, you know,
*  everyone says, well, what about the money?
*  What about the money?
*  Take a, take a, take a short term hit on your rights.
*  Your rights deal is going to be lower.
*  Right.
*  I understand that.
*  But the right, right.
*  Deal is going to be higher anyway.
*  So maybe that's a little bit of a yin yang thing.
*  And you're splitting the money with the players.
*  You know, it's just, the answer is less regular season games.
*  That's, that is the answer.
*  We all know that is the answer and just needs to happen.
*  And it's going to be a short term hit, but a long term game.
*  What would Stern do?
*  I don't know.
*  I think you just have to do less.
*  It has to be shorter.
*  It has to be a shorter regular season.
*  That is the answer that is.
*  And I can't take my kids to games.
*  I got three kids.
*  I'm looking at four tickets for like a bad tickets for the Knicks or the Nets even.
*  And I just cannot do it.
*  Every time I look at it, I'm just like, no chance.
*  No way am I doing that.
*  Spending a thousand dollars to watch the Knicks lose by 15.
*  No chance.
*  Wow.
*  Come on.
*  The Knicks are red hot right now.
*  Last thoughts, how's.
*  Well, just the, the TV aspect of it is what intrigues me.
*  We had news over the weekend of another set of RCNs, you know, about to go under all of these,
*  these local TV deals are all going away because they're not profitable.
*  They can't make any money.
*  I don't, I don't understand how it is that the league expects some kind of,
*  you know, gigantic whopper of a, of a rights deal at the national level.
*  When they're telling us they don't give a shit about the regular season.
*  Why are they so certain that there's going to be a giant increase
*  in the national rights deal?
*  If, if the NBA finals this year is Denver against Milwaukee,
*  what kind of rating do you think that that's going to, going to fetch?
*  They were very lucky to get Boston and Golden State,
*  two marquee franchises, a gigantic markets last year.
*  And they celebrated the fact that there was a 22% increase in overall viewership of that,
*  that finals.
*  Let's see what that looks like.
*  If we get, you know, some smaller market teams into the finals this year,
*  which seems very possible to me.
*  Well, you think like going back to the eighties magic and bird, they give way to Jordan.
*  Jordan, um, a bunch of stars pop up during that whole run.
*  The Knicks are involved in the mid nineties, even when Jordan goes away, Jordan comes back.
*  Then you have this whole new wave of stars after Jordan leaves and we get the shack and Kobe era.
*  And then we kind of headed to the mid two thousands.
*  LeBron is starting to come in.
*  Kobe is there.
*  We have LeBron and Kobe, then Curry rises in the beginning in 2010s.
*  Then we have LeBron and Curry.
*  Curry's not 34 LeBron's been the league for 20 years.
*  Now we have Walker Kessler.
*  In the next wave of guys, it starts with Walker Kessler.
*  Yep.
*  But the next wave of guys, ironically, Tatum is the only American out of the top five.
*  You've Giannis, you've Embiid, you've Jokic, you've Luca.
*  And then Tatum and Jah.
*  Right.
*  Those would be like your top six.
*  So I don't know if any of them are going to resonate the way Curry, LeBron, like going
*  backwards, all those guys I just listed.
*  So that's another issue too.
*  It's like, who's going to be your version of, you know, Messi, Ronaldo, MJ, like the signature dude.
*  It's very interesting time.
*  I just, I need some indication that Adam Silver doesn't like this at some point.
*  Just at some point you're in charge of the league.
*  This is your league.
*  Like when the Donald Sterling thing happens and that's an easy slam dunk, everybody wants
*  the guy out of the league and you get to ride an under white horse and he handled that great.
*  That was awesome.
*  But now, now we're in the tough stuff.
*  This is the hard stuff.
*  This is, I, you are now actually potentially losing fans and losing passion for the game.
*  If you don't fix this and he doesn't seem fixated on it.
*  I'm disappointed.
*  All right, Chico, be well.
*  If you would have told me in September that a Greg Popovich coached San Antonio.
*  I had this.
*  This is my next pick was going to lose 16 games in a row in the national basketball
*  association with professional basketball players.
*  And the way the lottery is structured, you all know this, that they've, they sort of like
*  smooth that slope.
*  So you're not as rewarded for being the worst team in the league.
*  I'd be absolutely disappointed if you were to lose that game.
*  I would be, I would wonder about his health.
*  I would wonder about a clone situation.
*  And then you look, I think then you remember how they started their season.
*  Their lottery pick was kicked off the team for exposing himself multiple times.
*  Prima, like a team psychologist.
*  Tough one.
*  And then who also claims that the team didn't do anything about it when she reported it.
*  I don't know if any of that happened.
*  It's all alleged, but it is like this.
*  If you were told that you were going to lose, you know, you're going to lose.
*  If you were told me that this Spurs season would play out this way, I would assume something
*  really dramatic happened to Greg Popovich.
*  The fact that this is happening in front of my eyes, I have to do like a double take every
*  time I see it.
*  I'm shocked.
*  I want to know what you think, Bill.
*  How did this happen?
*  I was Greg Popovich, the head coach, losing 16 games in a row in the NBA.
*  It's hard to do.
*  House, this is what Popovich said in April last year.
*  I can't operate like that.
*  Meaning tanking, which might not be the most intelligent overall philosophy to have.
*  And I get that, but we am who we am.
*  We're going to go ahead and compete.
*  I think the young players gain a real understanding of a philosophically moral space where it's
*  the right thing to do to continue to compete.
*  Frankly, I do not know how I'd go to my team and say, okay, guys, we're not going to compete
*  the way we should.
*  He has this long quote about how important competitiveness is.
*  They just lost 16 straight.
*  16.
*  He's the best.
*  You think about how hard winning 16 is.
*  It's not equally hard to lose 16, but it's like here in the neighborhood.
*  Here's the defense.
*  They did this and they got Tim Duncan and they got basically two decades and they got
*  five titles and they ended up with one of the best seven players of all time.
*  And they must think Wemba Nyama is that good for them to do this.
*  That's my takehouse.
*  I don't think they would do this every year, but I think they're looking at this and they're
*  like Wemba Nyama and look at Scoot.
*  Do you see that picture of Scoot this weekend?
*  Scoot looks like he's 30.
*  He looks like a linebacker.
*  Yeah, he's completely...
*  Seriously.
*  If you fall to number three, then you get...
*  Oh, oh, wait.
*  Wow, that then it gets...
*  Oh, yeah.
*  No, no, there's some other guys before you have to go to that.
*  Oh, no, there's some other guys that are involved in some very serious situations in
*  Alabama right now.
*  Okay.
*  Is there another non-US player?
*  Anyway, my view of the Spurs is like right on time, like the clock strikes 12, who's
*  going to be the very best team at tanking?
*  If you put a challenge in front of the Spurs and say, here's the challenge that's in front
*  of you, let's go execute this massively.
*  You'd be the champion of tanking.
*  If you find out who coach of the year is, I think we just found out.
*  That's exactly right.
*  We talked through Greg Popovich, coach of the year.
*  I'm glad that we were able to unpack this on the pod house.
*  You're right.
*  Nobody more masterful.
*  We have a trauma for Wim Benyama sweepstakes right now.
*  Rockets are 13 and 46.
*  Spurs 14 and 47.
*  Detroit's 15 and 46.
*  Then the fourth team is Charlotte, who actually has looked pretty confident lately.
*  I was texting you about this last night house that Hayward's been playing pretty well.
*  They've won four straight.
*  So it seems like they know Orlando's 25 and 36.
*  They're fifth.
*  So Charlotte can actually try and they're kind of locked into the fourth spot.
*  Houston versus San Antonio versus Detroit.
*  They've combined it's an eight game losing street, 16 games and four games between those three.
*  So that's where we're going.
*  House, who do you have for your next pick?
*  It's the Utah Jazz.
*  I'm feeling, you know, at this point in the season, I want to be a glass half full.
*  I like good stories.
*  I like good storylines.
*  When we were sitting in October, Miyu and Rosillo trying to forecast which team is going
*  to be openly planning for the Wim Benyama sweepstakes.
*  They compiled a mismatched team full of cast offs and castaways.
*  And God damn it, Will Hardy and Laurie.
*  Really, I had to put Utah on here for Saruti because Saruti had to stand up to Laurie Markkinen
*  and publicly apologize to his friend.
*  He was faced in Utah.
*  I think I have to stop calling him the Finnish Bardoni, which kind of hurts.
*  I mean, I've been calling Laurie Markkinen the Finnish Bardoni since his arrival as a rookie.
*  Little known fact, Chikobie fucking loved Bardoni's game there for like three years.
*  He really did.
*  When he got transferred to the Knicks, I was like, oh yeah.
*  Remember when the Knicks got Bardoni and Chikobie saying, whoa, here we go.
*  20 points a game guy.
*  Yeah, him with Mozgov, who knows what's going to happen.
*  He definitely had an unbelievable girlfriend.
*  That's the only thing I remember about Bardoni.
*  Yeah, that's a good one on Utah.
*  I had a Utah side one of just most improbable being Go Bear just for Walker Kessler is a
*  terrible trade for Minnesota.
*  Like just those two take away everything else that was in that trade.
*  Just straight up Go Bear for Kessler.
*  If you said in September, if this trade was just Go Bear for Kessler,
*  Minnesota would have a lot of regrets.
*  You'd be like, that's crazy.
*  That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
*  And yet Walker Kessler is the new Bill Russell.
*  All right.
*  My last take, man, you guys took some good ones there.
*  You're picking last.
*  I don't really want to.
*  I don't want to use my last pick.
*  LeBron averaging 30 points a game 17 years apart.
*  Seems pretty improbable to be, but not quite improbable enough for a draft pick.
*  If I told you that September, you wouldn't, you wouldn't be like,
*  you could see that happening.
*  Yeah, I could have seen it.
*  Yeah.
*  Brooklyn making that crazy Durant trade, but then not trading Seth Curry and Wat Nabi.
*  And now they're just kind of buried on the bench.
*  I, I'm just confused by that.
*  It's not a problem.
*  I'm just more dumbfounded.
*  Like how is Seth Curry not a contender?
*  What are you doing?
*  It's like they made that trade and there was like what 15 hours left to trade dead.
*  And Sean Marks is like, I'm going to go outside and have a cigarette guys.
*  I'll be right back.
*  And they never saw him again.
*  It's like there's still 15 hours left in trade deadline.
*  How do they still have Seth Curry house?
*  He played six minutes today.
*  The guy on Miami, he would close games for them.
*  I really think that there's a decent chance that not only do they drop down into the,
*  into the play-in, but that they get bounced, that they're out of the playoffs altogether.
*  Oh, I think you're right.
*  I think you're right.
*  But how do they end up with Seth Curry?
*  Like, hey, put him in the Phoenix trade, put him on Miami, put them somewhere.
*  They should try to at least buy him out.
*  We have multiple Rivers family members on the ringer podcast network.
*  Anyway, I don't have that one.
*  I think I have, even though we talked about them earlier, I think I have to do this one.
*  Golden state twice in four years coming off the finals, missing the playoffs
*  is an actual possibility.
*  Like I don't care how crazy like the pool punch, all that stuff, but just thinking like,
*  Oh, go and say might actually miss the playoffs.
*  That's in play.
*  But this just happened in 2020.
*  They missed the playoffs after they made the 2019 finals.
*  That could not have happened in the history of the league.
*  Somebody making the finals twice in four years and then missing the playoffs the next year.
*  That has to be making history.
*  Anyway, I would have that for most improbable.
*  And then the other one, this would be my tie for the last pick.
*  Then Jacob's the next nailing a free agent signing like actually like nailing it.
*  Poof.
*  I'm trying to think of last time that happened.
*  Like fucking nail into the wall.
*  I mean, you could say Randall.
*  What was that?
*  Three years.
*  63 was pretty good.
*  But this was like a marquee signing.
*  You had the Knicks fans going, wait, Jalen Brunson for 108 million.
*  But this is like one of the best signings of the last couple of years.
*  Yeah, it's the Knicks are extremely exciting here in New York with what the Knicks have
*  been doing of late recently.
*  And also like also improbable RJ Barrett still on the team.
*  Julius Randall still on the team.
*  They've got RJ Barrett's like a tick away from averaging 20.
*  They almost have 320 point scores.
*  I'm amazed.
*  Brunson is the king in New York.
*  Isn't he?
*  Isn't he?
*  Cubs people love.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, he's like five, nine.
*  It's so wild.
*  It's just like it doesn't make any sense.
*  Like I'm watching the game with my nine year old son.
*  I'm like, see that little dude there.
*  He's the best player on the floor right now.
*  He gets to whatever he wants, and he scores in the paint constantly.
*  And he gets whatever shot he wants and he runs the team.
*  It is really been.
*  I had faith in the sort of like new look front office because of like who the people were in
*  their names, but they hadn't shown me much.
*  But this time is one of the first times I was like, oh, maybe they do know what they're doing.
*  Okay, this makes some sense.
*  This does make some sense.
*  And then pushing this another way.
*  So we all love the challenge.
*  Now the Knicks, the Knicks aren't Johnny Bananas from a title standpoint.
*  Johnny Bananas, seven titles made the finals, just made the finals with Nani, almost won an eighth.
*  I went on his podcast.
*  They talk about it, but banana is like an institution on the challenge, right?
*  Year after year, people coming at them and the Knicks are an institution in New York,
*  even though they haven't won a title since 1973, there's still the Knicks, the New Yorkers.
*  There's generations of fans.
*  They're going to care about them the most.
*  And then that's where like the guy in the challenge who comes in, who's like,
*  they were like Nelson.
*  They're like, this is my year.
*  I'm going to, I'm going to steal the challenge from bananas.
*  I'm going to go right at him.
*  This is my chat.
*  And then it was just a disaster.
*  And then they lost on some climbing thing in round two.
*  The next challenge to the Knicks in New York was aborted.
*  Oh, it was bad.
*  It was never going to happen from the beginning.
*  It's over.
*  Never going to happen.
*  It never had a chance to begin with.
*  We've got, we've got James Harden, Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving on the same team in New York City.
*  Collectively, it was just like, so you've got
*  Julius Randall.
*  They're like, we just got a hard scene.
*  Should they relocate?
*  Should Brooklyn relocate to Kobe?
*  Oh, oh, they can't.
*  It's, you know, the Jersey is going to sell.
*  They're going to be good eventually.
*  The Liberty play there.
*  Are they?
*  It's a great venue.
*  I think I should have two teams.
*  I agree.
*  It's the same thing with that way.
*  Like they, people have come through twice.
*  It's a huge city.
*  You get, I mean, double the honest games, double the yolkage games.
*  Like there's a game.
*  Stealing from Jersey though.
*  That felt that.
*  Why the, why the theft?
*  Jersey was close enough.
*  You ever go to a Nets game in New Jersey?
*  It was one of the most depressing things ever.
*  But I like when, cause it happens here in LA too.
*  Like yolkage has a, has a weekend in March where it's like Knicks at one o'clock on
*  Saturday, Nets at one o'clock on a Sunday.
*  And if you love basketball in New York, it's like, all right, it's yolkage weekend or
*  you have the same thing where Yanis will be in there.
*  Knicks Tuesday night, Nets Wednesday night or something like that.
*  So I'm glad we have two teams.
*  We can gamble here.
*  So, you know, the second game is almost guaranteed to be a no.
*  It happens all the time.
*  It's like, oh, we're playing the Knicks on Thursday and then we're playing the Nets
*  on Saturday.
*  It's like, they're going to lose to the Nets.
*  That is a schedule loss.
*  You're going to go out Friday night in New York City.
*  I know you are.
*  House gambling legal in Massachusetts on March 10th.
*  Whoa, that is bad for the J-Bug.
*  I mean, it's bad for a few people I know in the in the extended Boston area, including
*  myself when I go back to Boston.
*  Yeah, right.
*  I was just in Colorado for for All-Star Weekend and you're just looking at those All-Star
*  props like, all right, Mack McClung, minus 125.
*  Winner.
*  You really start.
*  Well, you know, it wasn't a winner was team LeBron.
*  But it is it is nice to have those easy ones.
