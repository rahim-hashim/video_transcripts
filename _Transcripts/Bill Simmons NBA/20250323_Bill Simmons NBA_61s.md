# Does Risacher still go #1 in a 2024 NBA Re-Draft?
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [March 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGBfdLv6mv8)
*  My one would still be Castle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGBfdLv6mv8&t=0.0s)]
*  Would your one still be Castle or is there anyone in this draft you like more than him? [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGBfdLv6mv8&t=1.84s)]
*  I'm not, I'm not ready to put Castle one, even though I know he's. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGBfdLv6mv8&t=5.4s)]
*  Rookie of the year. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGBfdLv6mv8&t=9.36s)]
*  And there's just a toughness and maturity to his game. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGBfdLv6mv8&t=9.9s)]
*  That feels like a really good bet as far as the floor, but I like what I've seen [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGBfdLv6mv8&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  from Risa Shea, so I still think he's number one. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGBfdLv6mv8&t=17.32s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGBfdLv6mv8&t=20.0s)]
*  Make the case for Risa Shea. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGBfdLv6mv8&t=20.76s)]
*  It was pretty clear early on that his, his comfort level was a little bit higher [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGBfdLv6mv8&t=22.28s)]
*  despite his physical disadvantages. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGBfdLv6mv8&t=27.16s)]
*  And I just think at that size and that kind of shop making, there's a, that's the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGBfdLv6mv8&t=29.52s)]
*  reason why that guy goes number one. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGBfdLv6mv8&t=33.32s)]
*  And that's why even through a rookie season, there'd still be a lot of teams [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGBfdLv6mv8&t=34.88s)]
*  and be like, give me the ceiling of that guy, not just his spot of ability, but [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGBfdLv6mv8&t=37.68s)]
*  off the dribble at that size. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGBfdLv6mv8&t=41.68s)]
*  Like even if Castle would probably be the popular pick and maybe everybody's right. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGBfdLv6mv8&t=43.6s)]
*  Do you understand the ceiling part of it for his size and shooting? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGBfdLv6mv8&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I had him. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGBfdLv6mv8&t=50.8s)]
*  He was number two to me. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGBfdLv6mv8&t=52.68000000000001s)]
*  And I just like Castle a little more because I can see him as a top three [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGBfdLv6mv8&t=53.84s)]
*  guy on a contender down the road. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGBfdLv6mv8&t=58.400000000000006s)]
