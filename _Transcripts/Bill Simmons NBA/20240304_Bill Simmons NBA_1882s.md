# Bill Simmonsâ€™s NBA All-Star Disappointments | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [March 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qRhF6XXN5M)
*  Let's do the disappointment.
*  We're gonna call this the disappointment all-stars.
*  We'll just make a team, team of 12.
*  We're going 12 deep, no extra Ross response.
*  Yeah, we'll go fast.
*  There's a couple that, I mean, we're not gonna spend
*  an hour talking about Monty Williams.
*  Who is your number one pick for the disappointment all-stars?
*  2000. Monty Williams.
*  He's the captain. Monty Williams, captain.
*  I don't wanna make him the captain.
*  Look, there's two different numbers that flow out there
*  that he's 196, well, let me put it this way.
*  There's two different numbers.
*  I think it's without Chris Paul in games
*  and without Chris Paul on the roster.
*  And basically both of them tell you
*  he's 100 games under for both.
*  We've already covered this.
*  We even covered it last week.
*  But there's a lesson in this.
*  It's just because you've been bad for a long time
*  doesn't mean you're due to be good.
*  Okay, this isn't a roulette wheel.
*  This is still, you are only going to be as good
*  or as bad as your roster.
*  And I felt like there were a couple teams this year,
*  I think Charlotte thought they were gonna be good.
*  I think Portland thought, hey, we have Aitin
*  and we got Brogdon coming off the bench
*  and we've got Sharp, we've got Simons,
*  we've got the Snoop guy.
*  Like, hey, you know, as a plucky,
*  maybe we're fighting for a nine or a 10 or whatever.
*  It's like, nope.
*  So you can start carrying yourself like your owed
*  improvement just because you haven't been good
*  for a long time.
*  And I think Detroit should have just looked
*  at the four guys that matter, that they've had these.
*  And I still like, I think all four of those guys.
*  I know I'll probably be super disappointed by two of them,
*  but just like, what was the point of trying
*  to balance this out until you figure out what you have
*  with those guys that you've spent these high picks on?
*  So that's my, I don't need to do anymore
*  and I've already spent too much time on it.
*  My number one pick, I guess this is the second pick
*  of the Disappointment All-Stars, Jordan Poole.
*  And I'm gonna zag a little bit.
*  It's not just that he's been really bad to watch
*  and that's one of the worst trades in a while now
*  because that's one of the worst contracts in the league.
*  I just thought it would be more fun to have him
*  on a bad team.
*  From a league pass standpoint, not only is it not fun,
*  it's the opposite of fun where I feel bad
*  for him half the time.
*  I don't wanna feel bad for guys on league pass.
*  That's not what league pass is for.
*  I either wanna watch really good teams battling
*  or I wanna watch players on bad teams
*  in meaningless games put up stats.
*  I don't wanna feel sad for somebody.
*  And over and over again, when you watch these Wizards games,
*  you feel sad for them.
*  I feel bad for Jordan Poole.
*  I feel like that Draymond punch
*  kinda changed the course of his career.
*  And he's so bad in some of these crunch,
*  like in the Laker game the other night
*  where he actually kept the minute, got hot.
*  And then he's like, I'm feeling it.
*  And then he took like four or five of the worst shots
*  I've ever seen in my life.
*  And then like sad Jordan Poole came back.
*  It just bums me out.
*  It's way worse than just that he's been not good
*  on the Wizards.
*  Jordan Poole, also on my board.
*  I think you're.
*  Shooting splits, 40 and 31% from three.
*  I mean, he shot like almost 37% from three
*  a couple years ago.
*  And you're right, at one point with the Warriors,
*  you're like, hey, they did it again.
*  They did it again with one of these late picks,
*  high profile recruit, whole deal.
*  He's gonna be at least Luke Williams or Jawel Crawford.
*  He's gonna be one of those guys, worst case scenario.
*  So he's taken 14.6 field goal attempts per game.
*  That's 52nd most shots per game in the NBA.
*  If you go through the top 100 field goal attempt guys,
*  all right, the guy who takes the most shots
*  to the 100th most, he's 99th in field goal percentage.
*  Ugh.
*  Scoot's number one.
*  I mean, every advanced metric is a disaster.
*  99th lowest.
*  Scoot has not had a month over 40% from the floor.
*  So he's also probably on the border
*  for the disappointment driver.
*  I'm not gonna pick him because I have to wait
*  until next year to actually be disappointed
*  by the whole thing.
*  I would feel a little worse for Poole
*  if I didn't see it in person with that Wizards game.
*  It's funny because after we talked about the Wizards
*  and I said multiple times how bad they were,
*  I love chesty fans from this kind of team
*  where I don't know what I'm talking about
*  because they're tanking.
*  It's like, yeah, but you know what most teams do
*  even if they're tanking?
*  When they inbound the ball and they're on defense,
*  they don't just let a guy go down to the other rim.
*  Right.
*  In high school you do that.
*  Also, what are you tanking for?
*  This is the worst draft in 10 years.
*  Well, lock up the number one pick.
*  It's a fun, I don't think they have to worry about it.
*  And then when he said his legacy was cemented,
*  I just don't think anybody under 30
*  should talk about their legacy being cemented.
*  When, you know, look he helped that team.
*  But yeah, also on board.
*  And then every three months,
*  Draymond will give another interview about the fight.
*  I tried to get Iguodala this week to open up about it.
*  All right.
*  You're up next.
*  Atlanta Hawks, 26 and 34.
*  They were on my board.
*  Two games up on the 11 seed Brooklyn Nets.
*  If Brooklyn were actually like a little more stabilized,
*  you wonder if Atlanta would miss the play-in.
*  Through 60 games last year, they were 30 and 30.
*  They finished 41 and 41.
*  This team should at least be 500.
*  But defensively, they are 28th in the league,
*  only better than Charlotte and your Wizards.
*  I was in Boston visiting my daughter right for the NBA season
*  and I made a slew of future props on FanDuel.
*  And I did really well,
*  except for everything I put the Hawks in.
*  Because I thought we both, you and I thought,
*  oh, Quinn will get them to like 43 and 39.
*  Yeah, that was pretty much it.
*  We're like, they're good enough to do that.
*  We're not saying they're gonna win the East,
*  but they're gonna be so good offensively.
*  And the fact that Jaelyn Johnson has been as good as he is,
*  and they're still not good,
*  some of the stats with them,
*  what did I say to you?
*  That their record against the spread,
*  they're like 23 games under 500 against the spread,
*  which is like impossible.
*  Vegas are just the line.
*  I have the number.
*  They're 19 and 41 against the spread.
*  They're covering 31.7% of the time.
*  It's impossible.
*  Charlotte is the next worst team at covering,
*  and they're covering 41% of the time.
*  So they're covering 10 points lower
*  than the second worst team.
*  Well, and that's why they need to be a high pick
*  on the disappointment all-stars,
*  because they're not just disappointing.
*  People kept thinking it was gonna turn around,
*  and they kept betting on them.
*  And be like, the last two Brooklyn games.
*  Yeah, right, right.
*  Oh, the Hawks are favored against Brooklyn.
*  It's today, it's today.
*  They're like, no, they lost again.
*  And they're kind of fun to watch.
*  They're also one of those teams that,
*  if you have somebody on the other team
*  that you either like watching,
*  or is on your fantasy team,
*  or something like, oh, he's got the Hawks tonight.
*  Could be a huge game.
*  This is the team, I think Luca will be the next guy
*  to get 81.
*  Kobe's 81 is gonna go down over the next two to three years.
*  Somebody's gonna do 80 plus.
*  And it's gonna be like Luca against the Hawks type thing.
*  But I think the Hawks are gonna be involved
*  in somebody's 81 point game.
*  Well, he did get his 70 against the Hawks.
*  He got 73 against him.
*  I'm saying like the 80 plus, whenever somebody does that,
*  it's gonna be against a team like that.
*  I think he could have had more points.
*  They actually needed to win that game,
*  and he was making some really good passes in that game.
*  Luca was still making the right plays.
*  I wish I had said this prior too,
*  because I completely agree with you.
*  Because Luca has the kind of game
*  where if he just decided,
*  I think there's a lot of players in the game
*  that were like, hey, I wanna get 60 tonight.
*  And then if a few go my way and I get a few free throws,
*  maybe we get a 70, maybe we get close to 80.
*  I think if Luca decided in an awful matchup defensively,
*  if he said.
*  I'm getting 20 points a quarter.
*  I'm just gonna get 80 tonight, guys.
*  And everybody was like, awesome, let's do it.
*  He's like, I'm getting 20 points a quarter,
*  and I'm gonna get to 80.
*  And then Grant Williams.
*  I'm gonna foul at everybody else.
*  Ever heard of passing?
*  Grant Williams is like, bad idea, Luca, I don't like it.
*  All right, my next pick.
*  OKC not trading for a center.
*  On the board, have it on my board.
*  It made me mad during the trade deadline.
*  We talked about it a lot.
*  It made me mad that they used the Bertons extension
*  for something that wasn't a center.
*  They also used it for Gordon Hayward,
*  who the odds of him being healthy during the playoffs,
*  I would say is a coin flip.
*  It's 50-50 at best.
*  He just has some of the worst luck of any in the league.
*  But the Gordon Hayward thing was way more
*  about clearing the cap space.
*  Once I looked at, sometimes I hate doing
*  the trade deadline stuff live because of that.
*  But when you looked at some of the stuff,
*  there's just more flexibility that allows them.
*  That's all.
*  OK, well, you know what else would have allowed them
*  something is getting a center,
*  because they have a chance to at least
*  make the Western Finals.
*  And I just think they could have topped the Gafford press.
*  Gafford is exactly what they needed.
*  Some flexibility depending on the team.
*  They just don't have enough flexibility
*  for three straight playoffs series.
*  And I just don't fundamentally understand why Presti,
*  who I think has been in the running for best GM
*  in the last 15 years,
*  why he looked at this big picture and just thought,
*  we don't have enough to win the title.
*  I'm not going to use any assets.
*  When they have so many assets, I don't get it.
*  They could have topped that Dallas trade.
*  And it would have done nothing for them.
*  Like from an asset loss standpoint,
*  they would have been fine.
*  I know that we look at centers like for a while,
*  it felt like, hey, you can just get one.
*  You'll get one late.
*  They're always nobody cares.
*  They're super cheap or whatever.
*  And then I think, I don't know if they banked on that or what,
*  but I just wish they had a different look.
*  I wish they had.
*  It's not even about every single playoff game,
*  but depending on a certain matchup,
*  I just wish they had a little bit more behind Shet
*  and Jaylen Williams.
*  Yeah.
*  If they end up playing Minnesota in a playoff series,
*  you're basically going to have to duct tape the series together
*  and hope Shet doesn't get in foul trouble
*  and try to attack them in different ways.
*  I just don't know why they removed the option for themselves.
*  All right.
*  Who do you have next?
*  Tobias Harris without MB.
*  I know he had 28 points today.
*  Yeah.
*  We've talked about Tobias Harris a lot.
*  I beat this joke to death.
*  I don't know.
*  Every month or so, I would just tweet out,
*  like, hey, the Sixers have Tobias Harris.
*  No, he gets a chuckle out of me.
*  I know.
*  That's why I do it.
*  January, 19-6, 3 and 1 half assists,
*  51 and 35% from the floor and 3, 4 and 1 half free throw attempts
*  for game in January.
*  So no MB, right?
*  Got hurt in that Warriors game.
*  That was the very end of the month.
*  He's 15-6 and 3 and 0.7 assists.
*  He's shooting 25% from three, and his free throws
*  are down by more than half.
*  So I know that Buddy Heald and Ubre were like, hey,
*  that big guy's finally out of our way.
*  Yeah.
*  Heald's like, now it's Buddy time.
*  And Max, he should be taking a ton of shots or whatever.
*  But it just unfortunately kind of reinforces some of the stuff.
*  You look at Tobias.
*  We all know how talented he is.
*  But I would be looking at that if I'm another front office.
*  And who knows?
*  Maybe it's going to be a team that's like,
*  we've got to spend our caps base on somebody
*  and whatever he's talented, he'll score.
*  Orlando, come back.
*  Yeah, he's tall, so that would fit in.
*  But I know he had a nice game tonight.
*  But how do those numbers go down?
*  Unless the argument is that MB just makes his life
*  that much easier and all that stuff.
*  But there's just certain nights where it's like, hey, man,
*  you're going to have to take some bad shots.
*  You're going to have to bail them out of this.
*  And he can't quite do it.
*  Yeah, I'm with you.
*  I went on a three-hour walk with my wife today.
*  And I watched the entire Mavs Sixers game on my phone
*  as we were walking.
*  And at halftime in the game, Stephen A came on
*  and brought up Tobias Harris.
*  And he says, and he said something like,
*  we don't talk about Tobias Harris enough.
*  And I was like, I was walking up like,
*  that's got to be one of the weirdest sentences
*  anyone said this year that we don't talk about.
*  So we should be talking about Tobias Harris more?
*  Because I feel like we've actually probably talked about
*  Tobias Harris too much is where I landed
*  as I walked on some side street in West Hollywood.
*  I think that's the show.
*  That's the show.
*  We were talking about Blaine Pye.
*  All right.
*  And I think the new show is you just have one person
*  that we generally trust, higher approval rating
*  in sports media.
*  Yeah.
*  And they just come on for like 10 minutes a week
*  and go, talking about this too much,
*  need to talk about this more,
*  need to talk about this a little less.
*  You're too much, not enough for just right?
*  Right.
*  And so all he's doing is keeping track of
*  so that all of us know.
*  Cause it is, look, I'm guilty of it.
*  I've done it plenty of times, you radio show it.
*  But when you think of the statement
*  and then how there's never a fucking followup to it
*  of we need to be talking about fill in the blank more.
*  And then everyone at the desk-
*  It's a big college football and NFL one.
*  Right.
*  You just, then everybody just looks at the person.
*  It's like, okay, so what is now?
*  So it would be like, all right, next step,
*  Jalen Williams.
*  And I'll be like, need to talk about it more.
*  It's like, no, I meant the other Jalen Williams.
*  Oh, maybe just enough.
*  Probably good.
*  Yeah, we're probably okay.
*  J Will, not J Dub.
*  I just write one and two.
*  All right, my next one.
*  I don't know if this guy's on your board.
*  What's your name?
*  Okay.
*  Michael Bridges.
*  P-E-R went from 21 to 16 on my board.
*  Oh, he was.
*  Okay.
*  You know, average 26 a game after the KD trade.
*  A lot of talk about how he was this rising star
*  including on this podcast
*  and became the guy on Brooklyn this year.
*  And it's starting to look like he's the third option.
*  And as you and I have discussed many times,
*  I think if you're the first option on a basketball team in the NBA,
*  you're probably going to score around 20, 21 points as a worst case scenario.
*  It's called the Jeremy Grant corollary.
*  And Cambridge is 21 a game, never jumps off any of the TVs for me.
*  And I just.
*  Disappointed.
*  That's where I landed.
*  This is disappointment though, directly in relation to like, Oh my God, last year.
*  Cause he was awesome.
*  Yeah.
*  It was like, Whoa, is this guy now a top 20 guy in the league?
*  Yeah.
*  And you know, I was, I admit all the years in Phoenix, I was like, I still
*  think he's somebody that, that needs other things to happen around him.
*  And then the way he was getting to kind of the middle area, you know, those,
*  they weren't just straight, like Booker mid range pullups, but he would work it.
*  And he'd get these.
*  He would get, and it was like, man, he's got the ball in his hands all the time.
*  And this stuff's all happening.
*  I mean, his box score plus minus went from over three last year, or not a great
*  team with Brooklyn to zero this year.
*  Uh, I don't love the full cam Thomas experience.
*  The usage is dipped down.
*  So there's other guys taking shots, but for somebody that you thought, like,
*  maybe he actually is a two on a really good team.
*  I, there's just a decline there.
*  There's a decline there for his numbers.
*  That is alarming based on how excited we were with his Brooklyn run last year.
*  Unless it could be the bicycle.
*  Some people are saying curse a Tommy alter.
*  It's a hell of a curse.
*  We love you, Tommy.
*  Um, I just thought he'd be better on Brooklyn.
*  I agree.
*  It seemed like, especially with scoring up 25 a game minimum, and then he was
*  kind of floating around like, uh, uh, yeah, I guess I want to be here for now.
*  There was a couple of those.
*  I know the, uh, the side family loves them, but, um, I'll tell you this.
*  He would not be untradable for me if I was the nets.
*  Like if okay.
*  See, wanted to come in and say, Hey, we're going to be a shitload of picks here
*  or pick a team that's got a ton of assets.
*  Yeah.
*  But I got to know what the picks are now.
*  Like, I think we've all fallen for this.
*  It's like, Oh, we'll give you four first.
*  We're like, okay, what are they two lottery and two top 24 protected
*  a good young player too.
*  I'm just, Brooklyn is in all time.
*  No man's land with this team they have.
*  And they're either the 11th seed or the 10th seed.
*  Congratulations.
*  Who's next on your board.
*  There's a couple of that I cannot believe have not gone yet.
*  I'm going to do it.
*  It's dangerous because it all could be corrected if a playoff run happens, but
*  Dame is not the same guy.
*  This is not who you thought you were getting.
*  If you were a buck, this would have been a good hottest take.
*  Uh, whether it's the metrics, he's not the same guy.
*  He's just not, uh, you know, it's not the same.
*  He's good.
*  Once he's a, I'm good.
*  Once a week guy now, or I'm good.
*  Once every 10 gay or the quarter, he'll have that quarter.
*  You're like, okay, it's Dame's time.
*  It's not like, Oh my God, Dame just ripped off this eight game stretch
*  where he averaged 35 a game and made six threes.
*  I just think he's at a different point of his career, but he still can dial
*  it up in the fourth quarters.
*  Like there's been moments where he can summon it for four or five minutes, but
*  I think over the course of the game, not the same.
*  No, the January shooting numbers were terrible sub 40 sub 30 from three, but
*  whatever, um, you know, you look at that and go, okay, not a big deal.
*  I mean, his overall shooting numbers from the floor are probably lower than
*  people realize just because he's been such a dynamic score, but he also
*  got to the free throw line so many times.
*  And now like February into March, he's not getting to the free throw line as much,
*  which is always a bit of an alarming thing for somebody that lives off their
*  athleticism, but I think I've watched them enough to be like, ah, he's still
*  getting to the floor, like he's still getting to the rim, he's still getting
*  past guys, he's still one of those really good small finishers.
*  I don't know if the rim rate numbers would tell me something different there,
*  but you know, that's the thing I always worry about with somebody who's a little
*  bit older and had the injury history with all this stuff, but just who he has been
*  this year, if you're a Bucks fan, you're probably, you probably thought you were
*  getting a little bit more and the numbers would tell you that you would
*  have been getting something more even in his last year with Portland, where like
*  that's a terrible defensive team and he was still a plus seven in the box and
*  now he's like a plus 1.9 and his lack of interest defensively, like there'll be
*  moments and then people put out clips be like, oh, he did this.
*  I noticed like it happens a lot, I think with Milwaukee and maybe they're just
*  like, Hey, we'll worry about it when we get to the playoffs and none of this will
*  matter.
*  And I still think they have a chance because Giannis is that good, but he hasn't
*  played.
*  No, they, they're in a way better spot than they were, but I'm with you on Dame.
*  And they, and he hasn't played in the playoffs.
*  It'll be the first time he's played in the playoffs in three years.
*  I forgot to do this in my hottest take about Miami.
*  Super lucky.
*  They didn't make the Dame trade.
*  Now they're now you're cooking.
*  Now I'm cooking with gas.
*  Yeah.
*  Fucking typical Miami.
*  They, even when they seem like they slipped in shit, it turned out it was, it
*  was a good thing for them.
*  Um, all right.
*  So I, I'm just not going to take them.
*  I'm going to make you take them.
*  My next disappointment, all star.
*  We haven't had a GM yet.
*  Messiah, Messiah, you Jerry, I just don't understand what you've done the last
*  three years.
*  I don't understand the team you've assembled.
*  I don't understand if you're trying to tank or be good.
*  Um,
*  so the nurse thing in there,
*  the Nick, the nurse thing was super weird.
*  The not getting anything for van Vleet thing was weird.
*  The team they have now, it's like, I kind of like this.
*  Like I like when they play a Linux with the guards and they've got, there's
*  something fun and kind of 2026 about it.
*  But at the same time, I don't think they would have any chance to even get to the
*  second round.
*  Um, and I dunno.
*  I just thought Scotty Barnes.
*  I know, I know the stats are there and I know people are excited about him.
*  I just don't know where you're going.
*  If he's your main guy, then the last three minutes of games, I just feel like
*  there's better offensive players that he's going to be going head to head with
*  game after game.
*  And if you're really giving him the car keys to be your guy, not sure what, where
*  that's going ultimately in the East.
*  Well, it's a short list of guys that are like true number ones in carry you.
*  And despite how much I love Barnes and we both really like them.
*  I just don't know if he's that guy.
*  I don't think he is.
*  Probably not.
*  Don't love the shots, but I just, in general, and they might lose their pick.
*  The portal trade is just gets weirder by the week.
*  Um, and then not trading him at the deadline is also weird.
*  And I just, you know, I, I think sometimes like he, the Kawhi thing works out
*  right.
*  They win the title and everybody's like, this guy's amazing.
*  Messiah.
*  Whoa.
*  What a Jedi.
*  I talked about it on this pod.
*  He's a Jedi.
*  Amazing.
*  Maybe that was the worst thing that could have happened to him as a GM.
*  Cause it starts making you think, ah, can do anything.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know what I'm doing.
*  Cause the last few years have been pretty rough.
*  Most of these guys default to patients though.
*  So yeah.
*  Do you like, like quickly and bear it for in an OB and precious.
*  I didn't love that trade when it happened, but now I'm looking at it.
*  It's like, you're going to pay quickly $140 million.
*  I think we both said we like Barrett more before the trade happened.
*  Um, to be fair.
*  Yeah.
*  But I'm just saying they, they got the second and third guys in the trade.
*  They gave up somebody who is easily the best guy in that trade has now of course hurt.
*  I think you, yeah.
*  No, geez.
*  He's hurt a lot and he's going to be really expensive.
*  Yeah.
*  But Oh geez.
*  Corner three numbers.
*  Like I can't even know.
*  Like he's been terrific on the corner three stuff, but I don't know if you
*  looked at it with New York.
*  It's like, is he going to keep that up?
*  Cause like then it's at a whole nother level with it.
*  Uh, it sounds like you would rather he just do what everybody else did and trade for picks.
*  And instead it was like, maybe I'm going to get these guys, but now this problem is
*  like, once you get the guys and know who you are, you're going to be able to get
*  like, well I'm going to be able to find a way to zuke them up to a point where maybe
*  he's still crushed well, but covers the worst team that there is.
*  You know, but the point I can, I think, would be, okay.
*  I don't have, I may have a foot that I have not lost.
*  I'm not going to have a foot that I have not lost.
*  I'm not going to have a foot that I lost on my succeed, I might get the
*  m Not as flexible on my succeed as they did on the win.
*  Like this is not a very good team.
*  What was the point of the Olympic trade.
*  team in the league. So you know, but now, now you catch them on the hot team. Yeah.
*  I'm talking like this, my guy, Grant Williams, 40 minutes today, 18 and 13, five assists. He's
*  bringing a winning championship attitude to them. Uh, who do you have for next?
*  Imagine an assistant coach quote tweeting that you're a loser.
*  We didn't, we didn't talk enough about that.
*  People listening to the pod last year, we were dropping a lot of breadcrumbs.
*  I like him. I think he's a nice guy. I just, you know, maybe he needed a little bit of a come up.
*  And so now, uh, now he's had it. Who do you have for your next pick? I still have a couple good ones left.
*  Uh, yeah. The problem is we said six each and then we, we had overlaps, which we knew we were going to have.
*  All right. Can I re can I rip off a couple more of them? Yeah. I'm just going to say I'm disappointed in,
*  in myself.
*  Why would happen?
*  Why would happen?
*  Um, I'm on a new routine, working out, putting myself through some stuff.
*  Just started working out?
*  No, I've always been, but I, I, I want to take it to, to another level, like another level.
*  Oh, the no fucking around zone.
*  Like Eastern European steroids from the seventies. Like what kind of level are we talking?
*  Think, uh, Southeast Asia.
*  Okay.
*  And I w I was doing okay. I was doing the work. I was taking the steps.
*  And then I don't know if I fractured my leg or blew out my Achilles. I didn't blow up my Achilles.
*  I think I'd know by now, but, uh, you're injured.
*  Yeah. I couldn't walk for a day. And then the pain traveled from the front of the leg to the back of the leg.
*  So it was Muay Thai and we've been about six to seven months into it.
*  Pretty rigid, rigid training. And I was feeling good and my buddy was visiting me and he's like,
*  what the fuck are you doing? He's like, dude, have you looked at your birth certificate?
*  And I was like, I'm aware, I'm aware. And then the next day he was like, can you do anything?
*  And I was like, no, uh, I can't walk today, but I was able to walk after that day and see Yokech.
*  Yokech doesn't walk great, so he's doing all right.
*  So we're not, neither of us are taking scoop for the disappointment draft?
*  No, I haven't written down because I almost was going to say I was disappointed in myself until
*  the leg injury. And I just have, I've said this too many times in my pod. I've said it four fucking
*  times already. Talk to me next April and I'll give you, I'll give you everything you want.
*  I don't want it.
*  Not you, the Royal you, but I cannot do it until he's this bad again next year. Although I did
*  think there were some small glimpses before this last abductor injury.
*  I've sold no stock, no stock.
*  Oh, I love it. Is that because you're right or stubborn?
*  I just think that team is, that team is bizarre.
*  Yeah, but he's also, sure, but he's also, he's also, he's also, he's also, he's also, he's also,
*  bizarre. Sure. But he's also had moments where it's like, you don't have to be this bad.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  Evan Mobley not being awesome yet. I have as a personal disappointment.
*  And by the way, he's, since he came back from injury, he's been pretty good. And he had a
*  couple of defensive sequences. He's always going to have earlier this week where you're just like,
*  oh, there it is. But I'm telling you, let's, let's watch for it. What's the closing five
*  of close games in the fourth quarter? Like start paying attention to that. Cause in the Dallas
*  game, he was not in there and then came in for defensive substitution. So it's just something
*  I know now with Cavs games, I'll go back and I'll look at the fourth quarter to see what happened
*  with them. This would be a tough one for me because I was really all in on him. I think the
*  dunk special special player, the dunk is not my regret. I have some regrets. Yeah.
*  I mentioned the Lakers not taking Hawkeyes as a disappointment, although maybe also a,
*  a positive thing. And then I had Zion's rebounding
*  in the disappointment all-stars. I'm not going to put Zion in there because Zion still been really
*  fun to watch and there's a rebounding. This is, this is new.
*  Oh, sorry. Sorry. Oh, it's new. It's getting fucking worse.
*  He just never has rebounded as well as you would think for somebody like him.
*  He used to get seven a game. He said five and a half this year. It's five and a half rebounds a game.
*  You've always been a stickler.
*  It's embarrassing.
*  By the way, Mobley came in today with 454 left down six, and then it looks like he closed out the game,
*  but we're taping this while that happened. So I didn't know. That's a good sign,
*  but there's no Mitchell today.
*  One of my favorite char Charles Barkley things is when he gets mad when big guys
*  can't get eight rebounds a game.
*  He's right. That's two rebounds a quarter. You can't get two rebounds a quarter.
*  He's right. It's two rebounds a quarter. Zion can't get one and a half. He can't get three rebounds a half.
*  Three.
*  Rebounding. You have to decide you want to rebound. You do. And he's decided I don't want to rebound.
*  And he's made a decision. He's made his announcement. I'm actually good.
*  I'm not going to make a decision for Christ.
*  I'm going to, uh, I'm going to read you all the guys who
*  have more rebounds than Zion in the, let's see, five and a half.
*  The, Oh, this would be a good game show. Does this guy have more rebounds per game than Zion?
*  Donovan Mitchell.
*  Active.
*  Yes. Higher or lower.
*  Oh, higher.
*  He's lower. He's 5.4.
*  Wow. You set me up.
*  I did.
*  Vince Williams Jr. More or less than Zion.
*  More.
*  5.6. Drew Holiday.
*  Really good rebounding guard. Uh, I'll say he's still under.
*  Higher.
*  5.7.
*  Wait, in Zion's what again?
*  5.5. Five and a half rebounds a game.
*  So we get it off a tent here. I got to get it right. This is tough. All right. I'll lock in.
*  I'll lock in.
*  Kevin Love.
*  Who's playing lower. 17.5 minutes a game. Kevin Love.
*  Lower.
*  Higher. He's averaging 6.2 rebounds a game.
*  This is like rock, paper, scissors. And you just in my head, I don't even know what you're going to.
*  I'm going to go scissors eight straight times.
*  James Harden.
*  Higher.
*  Not lower. 5.1. You're just getting killed.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, this is the company that he's in. If you look at the rebounding leaders.
*  Zion, can you get to eight? You just get two rebounds a quarter.
*  What's the most he's ever had in a season? Do we know?
*  A little over seven. It's weird because he has the explosiveness. He's got the girth.
*  He's just not interested in doing it.
*  So 7.2 his second year, then missed third year, fourth year, and then he played 29 games. So he
*  didn't get tired that year. Look, I think when I see it, he just peels off.
*  So neither of us took Jalen Green.
*  No, he went off last night.
*  There's been just enough flashes from him that I'm not giving up on something maybe
*  significant happening with him at some point. I just wish he was on a bad team making mistakes.
*  Feels like this team is the worst team for him. Would have been fun if he was on Charlotte or
*  something. I don't know. Did he get to do that for two years? I mean, it's not like they're awesome
*  this year. I know, but he's still pretty young. I think he's like 21.
