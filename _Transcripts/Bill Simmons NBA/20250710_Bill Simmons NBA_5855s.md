*  We're, we're going away from the NBA. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=33.12s)]
*  We got summer league. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=34.84s)]

*  Do you? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=36.2s)]
*  No, I mean, I just seeing clips tonight as I was prepping this out, I'm like, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=37.88s)]
*  I can't, I can't do this right now. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=43.44s)]
*  Somebody sent me a text last night about how edge comb looks so much better than [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=45.68s)]
*  Bailey and I was like, I need a break. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  I need a break. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=51.68s)]
*  I'm not ready for any of this. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=52.32s)]
*  Uh, I do think the summer league, I'll, I'm sure I'll watch some of the clips [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=54.36s)]
*  and stuff, I'm not going to go. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  Um, but I just, I need a break that, that 17 day finals followed by the draft [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=60.32s)]
*  right after that, all the fridge. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=66.16s)]
*  So I'm like, all right, I need a, I need a reset. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  Gotta start thinking about NFL. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  Did you start your prep yet? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=70.80000000000001s)]
*  For NFL? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=72.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=74.76s)]
*  I need, I need a full, like I was going to go to summer league. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=75.88s)]
*  And then I realized I'm like, I'm not going to go to summer league. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=79.64s)]
*  110 degrees. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=83.88s)]
*  It was this unbelievable epiphany because the problem is it's too busy. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=85.36s)]
*  It's too popular now. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  And it's a great setup for families. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=89.44s)]
*  It's great for kids. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=91.64s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=92.52s)]
*  If you're a basketball junkie, the cost is great, but now the smaller gym, it's [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  like really hard to find a spot. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=98.24s)]
*  And even if you have the media pass, it can be a pain if you're jumping back and [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=99.88s)]
*  forth and you know, I think a lot of us that have been doing it for a bunch of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  years, there's different people with teams that you want to say hi to, but I [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=106.75999999999999s)]
*  don't blame them for never wanting to talk to us. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=109.16s)]
*  So they're all roped off now and it's been happening at the combine. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=111.72s)]
*  So now, now you end up kind of like sitting by yourself, just watching [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=114.72s)]
*  basketball the whole time and you're not like somebody might wave to you. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=118.92s)]
*  And then a kid in a security jacket. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=122.12s)]
*  It's like, what are you doing? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=123.6s)]
*  So, um, I went, I went to Vegas too many times over the stretch of like F1, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=124.28s)]
*  super bowl, everything that we were doing. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=129.64s)]
*  So I just realized the other day, I was like, Hey, you don't have to go. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=131.92s)]
*  I was like, perfect. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=136.44s)]
*  Summer league grew itself. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=137.96s)]
*  Now we sound like the two old media guys complaining about traveling somewhere [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=139.56s)]
*  for a fun sporting event, but I'm with you. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=143.28s)]
*  I don't want any part of it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  And also it is really hot. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  Like that Vegas hot that it hits in July when you leave the stadium and it's like [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=149.6s)]
*  one 13 it's three in the afternoon. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=153.88s)]
*  You're just like, why am I here? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=156.96s)]
*  What is this place? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=159.56s)]
*  But, uh, Cooper flag would be fun. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  I would, I'm sure Trey Johnson will have one heat check if he's there. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=162.4s)]
*  Um, so some stuff happened since the last time we, we talked, um, the biggest, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=166.4s)]
*  the biggest thing is Whitmore Island. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=173.08s)]
*  Now house is involved because he went to Washington. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=175.08s)]
*  Um, there were a couple of guys that, you know, there's so many movement back [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=178.44s)]
*  and forth now with its contracts are shorter and just guys, it's almost impossible [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=182.76s)]
*  to get like all of a sudden Jay Huff's on Indiana. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm like, Oh, I kind of like that. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=188.68s)]
*  Uh, Whitmore on the wizards, but Whitmore was one I was watching cause I, I'm [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=190.36s)]
*  still all in on that dude. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=195.52s)]
*  And I think in the right team in the right situation, that guy is [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=197.4s)]
*  instant offense off the bench. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=200.56s)]
*  I don't know if Washington's the right team or not, but I do like some of [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  the assets they're collecting. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=205.44s)]
*  We're going to talk about them in a second with a gimmick, but, uh, that [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=207.04000000000002s)]
*  was one of my favorites. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=210.08s)]
*  Did you have a favorite? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=210.88s)]
*  Oh, I'm so glad that guy's on that team. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=212.56s)]
*  Do you have any of those like the lower level ones? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=214.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I even, I even post on threads about Jay Huff. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=217.48000000000002s)]
*  I mean, that's where, that's where, you know, I'm really like locked in. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  Like it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=224.32000000000002s)]
*  Uh, I saw him. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  I went to go see McClung play for the South Bay Lakers. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  So it's a fun Thursday night, right? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=232.52s)]
*  But I noticed a lot of Jay Huff. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=235.0s)]
*  And then when Jay Huff was with Memphis, I'm like, you know, this guy might be [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=237.12s)]
*  the prototype of that stretch five. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=240.84s)]
*  Everybody's looking at maybe not the protection on the other side, but yeah, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  when I saw that Pacers, what they gave up, I'm like, great. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=245.68s)]
*  Love the Jay Huff acquisition Pacers. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=249.08s)]
*  Are they back? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=251.72s)]
*  Another one Pacers? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=252.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=253.52s)]
*  They could, they might be able to patch together some miles Turner stats. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=253.68s)]
*  The Halburn thing is going to be a little more insurmountable. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=256.52s)]
*  There's a couple of decent guys left. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=259.44s)]
*  I'm intrigued by Ryan Rollins seeing where he ends up. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=261.76s)]
*  We're at that level of free. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=265.0s)]
*  It's just there. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=266.4s)]
*  I'm like, I wonder who can snare Ryan Rollins. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=267.08s)]
*  Um, look, but we should say the cam went more thing for a second. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=270.04s)]
*  Cause I, I agree with everything you said, but I don't know if he should be someone [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=272.96s)]
*  you're ever describing as being all in on a guy, right? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=278.35999999999996s)]
*  Cause I think we kind of know what the downside to him is too. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=282.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=286.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=287.28s)]
*  I mean, if you're talking. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=287.55999999999995s)]
*  I don't know where a bench guy that could do a little like what math [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=289.67999999999995s)]
*  Warren was doing in the, uh, in the playoffs a couple of times. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=294.08s)]
*  I think that's the upside for him. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=297.47999999999996s)]
*  Um, I think the wizards, I like all this stuff they're doing. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=299.35999999999996s)]
*  There's some teams that I really do not like, which we're going to talk about [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=302.2s)]
*  in a second, but, um, from a big picture standpoint, okay. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  See is the heavy favorites. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=310.32s)]
*  And then there's a bunch of contenders after that. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=311.76s)]
*  And the odds are really interesting. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=314.6s)]
*  Do you know who has the second best odds on Fandota win the title right now? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=316.28000000000003s)]
*  Houston. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=319.64s)]
*  It's the New York Knicks. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=320.88s)]
*  They are now seven 50. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=323.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=325.0s)]
*  Houston, Denver and Cleveland are all plus eight 50. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  They're three, four, five. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=328.12s)]
*  And I think that's the consensus top five. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=330.04s)]
*  I Minnesota 17 to one. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=332.56s)]
*  I personally would have Minnesota in there as a top six. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=335.0s)]
*  Um, but I think because they lost Alexander Walker and maybe they made [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=338.44s)]
*  conference finals two years in a row, but I still feel like Minnesota [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=342.72s)]
*  should be in that combo. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=345.72s)]
*  Am I crazy? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=347.48s)]
*  No, I, this is the overreaction to the new stuff. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  Cause I've seen Houston. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=353.88s)]
*  I think Houston was second best odds for a little while. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=355.28000000000003s)]
*  And then the next, the Yabba Yabba, Sally just swung it and you get that [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=358.6s)]
*  guy's your seventh man. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=363.68s)]
*  By the way, Philly, this time it's personal was Yabba Sally. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=365.08s)]
*  He was like, they offered me 2 million. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=368.40000000000003s)]
*  Um, yeah, it was like, he was like, it's like they wanted me to leave. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=370.44s)]
*  They were like driving me to the airport trying to get rid of me. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=373.52s)]
*  It was weird. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=376.6s)]
*  I really like Yabba Sally. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=377.04s)]
*  I actually thought he would have been interesting Laker signing. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=378.56s)]
*  I think the Nixon done a really good job in like, it was, it was fun for them to [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=382.4s)]
*  be thinking we just need to add like two or three guys that can actually play in [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=386.56s)]
*  a top eight rotation for a good team and not have a cost a lot. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=389.92s)]
*  And this is something I was saying with Bobby marks on Thursday's pod is that. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=393.40000000000003s)]
*  Really good. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=397.76s)]
*  By the way. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=398.2s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=399.12s)]
*  It feels like you're going to love this. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=399.64s)]

*  The old Belichick free agency period where he was like, go ahead, everybody [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=404.56s)]
*  spend all your money, spend all your cap space to your guaranteed $60 million [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=408.16s)]
*  deals, we're just going to hang out here in the back. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=411.72s)]
*  Now, I think part of that success we realized too, was that he was a great [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=413.52000000000004s)]
*  defensive coach and Brady fixed all of their offensive limitations, but he would [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=417.92s)]
*  shop in this bargain base because there'd always be all these guys left. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=422.08s)]
*  And you'd be like, well, how was this guy 20 million guaranteed? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=425.4s)]
*  And this guy's like a $2.7 million guy for like one year with incentives. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=427.84s)]
*  I am wondering if, if you're like a pretty good team and granted you're up [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=432.96s)]
*  against the cap wise, if the advantage now with everything we're seeing with [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=436.84s)]
*  the first and second aprons is just like, Hey, we can pick off. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=440.56s)]
*  Like if you're getting a top eight minutes guy on a good team for free. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=443.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=448.88s)]
*  And I mean free in the sense of like what free is for an NBA investment, you [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=449.56s)]
*  know, one year, less than 10 million. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=453.68s)]
*  Uh, I wonder if that's something I'm wondering if that market is going to be [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=456.0s)]
*  where teams feel like, Hey, we can just wait around and grab somebody instead of [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=458.8s)]
*  grabbing our first or second choice. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=462.56s)]
*  There were some stunning salaries. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=464.64000000000004s)]
*  Like I thought, I thought Gary Trent with some of the stuff he did in the [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=467.0s)]
*  playoffs had at least earned his way into maybe like a two years, 15, two years, 16. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=471.16s)]
*  The bucks like kind of stole them and brought them back, you know, well, I'll [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=476.24s)]
*  save it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=480.64s)]
*  I have a whole bucks thing I want to do, but they, they have been able to patch [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=481.08s)]
*  together some salaries combined with the fact that they got Turner maybe for a [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=484.59999999999997s)]
*  little less than I think everybody thought he would go for a free agency. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  And I think they have two moves left to your point that it's like this bargain [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=493.68s)]
*  shopping, maybe you can grab a guy here or there. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=496.96s)]
*  The ones that I don't understand, because I agree with what you said is when [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=499.71999999999997s)]
*  teams are paying like 15 million a year for Schroeder, you know, or even like [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  Duncan one year 16, and then the second year you have an option, you have to buy [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=507.6s)]
*  it out. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=511.32000000000005s)]
*  But, um, I, that was what I, to me, you don't have to pay double figures for [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=511.6s)]
*  guys that aren't impact starters anymore. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=517.2s)]
*  The market seems to be somewhere between five and 10, or you could trade for a [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=519.84s)]
*  house or contract. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=524.4s)]
*  That's what made the nets that Terrence man signing so strained or trade. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=525.6s)]
*  It was like, Oh cool. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=529.6s)]
*  It was like, Oh cool. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=531.16s)]
*  We get Terrence man for 46 million for the next three years. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=531.9200000000001s)]
*  Like that's just not what the market would be for him. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=535.04s)]
*  If he was in the market, you're seeing it with somebody like coming to two [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=537.6800000000001s)]
*  where teams don't even know. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=540.64s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if that'll be resolved by the time people hear this, but [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=542.88s)]
*  they coming to things crazy. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=547.64s)]
*  That's somebody that over the years would have been at least three for 70. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=548.8000000000001s)]
*  Somebody would have taken a fire and I had no idea what he's going to get. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=552.88s)]
*  That seems a little high, but yeah, you'd think somebody would at least [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=557.12s)]
*  just send out some kind of offer sheet. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=560.48s)]
*  But if Brooklyn, I mean, it was just such a weird summer too, because it was like, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=562.96s)]
*  what's Brooklyn going to do? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=565.88s)]
*  What's Brooklyn going to do? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=566.84s)]
*  And it's like, well, you know what? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=568.52s)]
*  They're not going to do spend it on a player. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=569.5600000000001s)]
*  They want, they're going to take an asset and the man contract, uh, the Porter [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=571.36s)]
*  junior deal, you know, I know it's an unprotected and 32 for that, but you know, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=575.52s)]
*  I was thinking about this. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=580.76s)]
*  I'm like, once you've had to give up a pick just to get off of Porter junior at [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=581.84s)]
*  like 80 million the next two years. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=585.48s)]
*  This is going to be one of the things I brought up to you today. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=586.9200000000001s)]
*  What if they had offered? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=589.2800000000001s)]
*  No, what if they had offered Brooklyn? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=590.9200000000001s)]
*  Here's Michael Porter. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=593.48s)]
*  We'll give you our 2032 first, just absorb him into the cap space. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=595.6400000000001s)]
*  Like, do the nets do that? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=601.0400000000001s)]
*  Well, clearly they would have done it because they gave him cam Johnson. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=604.4000000000001s)]
*  That's the thing was like, they have to even put cam Johnson in the trade. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=608.0400000000001s)]
*  I just think that trade, the more I thought about it over the last five days, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=613.6s)]
*  I'm like, that's one of the worst trades of the decade that you have to, you have [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=617.4s)]
*  to attach a pick to get rid of Porter. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=622.76s)]
*  And I also didn't get anything for cam Johnson. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=625.12s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=627.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=629.36s)]
*  Cause that's Sam. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=629.5600000000001s)]
*  Glad. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=630.52s)]
*  I'm glad we hadn't talked about this at all because when it happened, it was like [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=630.84s)]
*  just, oh yeah, this makes sense. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=634.36s)]
*  And it's cam Johnson and he, and then at first it was like, I love cam Johnson [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=635.6s)]
*  way more than I like Porter junior for a bunch of reasons. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=639.88s)]
*  Then he costs half as much. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=643.76s)]
*  And so you're like, what's the cam Johnson trade if you're trying to acquire a good [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=645.92s)]
*  player, like, isn't there a piece? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=651.0s)]
*  And then this is classic, like salary cap dumping for the asset, which is what [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=653.32s)]
*  Brooklyn's whole approach was. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=658.84s)]
*  And I just felt like there should have been a second asset with this because they [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=660.5600000000001s)]
*  were giving up a player. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=664.6800000000001s)]
*  Other teams would have liked while also taking on Porter junior who had the worst [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=665.72s)]
*  contract. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=669.32s)]
*  So maybe their point is that with Porter junior, they'll be able to flip them in a [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=669.76s)]
*  year at 40 million and then get an asset on the way back. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=672.96s)]
*  That's the only thing I could, I could fathom them saying bad with, with the [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=676.9200000000001s)]
*  explanation of it all. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=681.2s)]
*  I thought it was a miracle trade for the nuggets when it happened. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=682.72s)]
*  And the more I thought about her over the last four days, I was thinking like, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=685.72s)]
*  think about over the years, teams adding pick, going back to the Kurt Thomas days, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=689.72s)]
*  teams adding picks to dump a contract, to try to reset their salary structure in [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=695.0400000000001s)]
*  some way. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=699.9200000000001s)]
*  Porter, I didn't think was tradable unless you took like a Bradley Beale or, you [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=701.1600000000001s)]
*  know, 78 million for two years. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=706.32s)]
*  He's a bad back. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=707.8800000000001s)]
*  He's a fucked up shoulder. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=709.24s)]
*  Um, I just think he's a 15 to $20 million player. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=710.96s)]
*  I mean, he was good in the 2023 finals. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=714.8000000000001s)]
*  It's not like he hasn't had good moments, but for them, he was a complete impediment [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=716.8800000000001s)]
*  to making their roster better because they couldn't touch Murray. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=721.44s)]
*  They couldn't touch Brown, couldn't touch Jokic. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=724.2800000000001s)]
*  Um, they, it's just, and they couldn't touch Gordon. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=727.3599999999999s)]
*  So what, how else were they going to improve the roster? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=730.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=732.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=732.9599999999999s)]
*  Here comes, here comes Brooklyn. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=733.56s)]
*  They're like, what if we just, we just need one pick and we'll save 70. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=735.3599999999999s)]
*  I was fucking crazy. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=739.88s)]
*  I think they could have taken Porter's thing, gotten a pick and traded Cam Johnson [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=741.8s)]
*  and ended up with way more. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=747.0799999999999s)]
*  And I, I continue to think they did an awful job, like really bad. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=748.4s)]
*  I didn't like their draft. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=752.76s)]
*  I don't like really any of that. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=753.9599999999999s)]
*  I don't think they have like an awesome kickass asset. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=755.56s)]
*  Um, their best asset is basically their own pick in 2026, which they traded to get back. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=758.5999999999999s)]
*  But, uh, I just don't understand anything they did. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=763.92s)]
*  They had all that cap space. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=767.1999999999999s)]
*  I said this to Rob Mahoney on Wednesday. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=768.8s)]
*  They were the guy in the fantasy draft that had a hundred dollars to spend with 10 and, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=771.7199999999999s)]
*  and everybody else ran out of money. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=775.8399999999999s)]
*  They were in the driver's seat in all these different ways. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=778.04s)]
*  I just don't think they exploited it correctly. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=780.68s)]
*  I don't like what they did. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=783.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, it must have been that there just weren't that many teams that were going to give up an [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=784.0s)]
*  asset to also park stuff to get off a cap space. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=787.24s)]
*  But for Denver, it's just perfect for Denver on top of the other things they get to do and bringing [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=789.6s)]
*  it like full circle to the odds. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=795.48s)]
*  Like Denver should be, Denver should be more of a favorite for an MBA title than Houston [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=797.24s)]
*  should be. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=801.48s)]
*  I said that on Wednesday. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=802.84s)]
*  That's the game. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=804.84s)]
*  No, I just said on Wednesday, they were nine to one on Wednesday. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=805.6s)]
*  I'm like, that's the best bet. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=808.48s)]
*  I think they should have the second best odds. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=810.44s)]
*  I think it'll be five to one by the time we start the season. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=812.36s)]
*  It looks like Mark Stein was reporting that they convinced Valenshuenis to stay for a year. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=814.9200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=819.5200000000001s)]
*  It seems like they have one more move that they can make. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=819.96s)]
*  They're under the apron, so they have flexibility during the season and they just have a [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=822.6s)]
*  better team. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=826.24s)]
*  Cam Johnson is going to be better for them than Michael Porter was. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=826.9200000000001s)]
*  He's going to be, I just think a better health bet for nine months. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=829.24s)]
*  He's just a better foxhole guy. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=834.0400000000001s)]
*  I think too. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=835.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=835.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, that's, that's my biggest thing with Porter Jr. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=835.96s)]
*  Like it is impressive, man, when he's, when he's, when he's, when he's, when he's, when he's [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=838.24s)]
*  six, 10, he's pulling up and he's hitting these shots off the dribble. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=841.84s)]
*  And you're like, this is ridiculous. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=845.32s)]
*  But then there's just a nicer, you're like, oh, I guess this guy's just totally out of [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=846.5600000000001s)]
*  it tonight. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=849.5600000000001s)]
*  And yeah, you know, for somebody who's been in the league as long as he's been in the [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=850.6s)]
*  league. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=853.48s)]
*  And it is also interesting too, like when we were going through, and I know you probably [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=854.2s)]
*  spent a good chunk of your Sunday doing what I was doing in preparation for this, but [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=858.1600000000001s)]
*  looking at all the extensions, looking at all the contracts and like the best thing you [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=861.0400000000001s)]
*  can be is in that Patrick Williams stretch of like, we're still not sure, but man, we'd [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=865.12s)]
*  hate to be wrong. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=869.72s)]
*  So here's your 90 million and Porter Jr. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=870.84s)]
*  Kills it because it's like, hey, you've been hurt, but God, you're so talented and you're [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=875.72s)]
*  so tall and you're such a good shooter and we don't really have other moves. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=880.84s)]
*  And we're also kind of cheap sometimes, but like that window of like, like, look, the [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=884.52s)]
*  best thing is to be awesome and then get the max extension, right? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=889.9200000000001s)]
*  Like a kid, Cunningham or something like that, even though, okay, you know, it took a little [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=892.9200000000001s)]
*  bit longer maybe. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=896.2s)]
*  And that's just another reminder. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=897.48s)]
*  We should maybe look at these point guards coming up through the draft and realize, you [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=898.56s)]
*  know, it might take these guys a little bit longer than being the finished like asset [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=901.3199999999999s)]
*  that you'd want. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=904.88s)]
*  But when you're like that top pick and you don't know, those are the contracts where [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=905.88s)]
*  now you're looking at it going, I can't like you said, Kaminga 70, like Kaminga might be [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=913.3599999999999s)]
*  not even like a full mid-level guy because there's also it's pretty clear, too. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=920.16s)]
*  I think there's enough teams that look at what her does and what Golden State does. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=924.0s)]
*  And I'm sure Kaminga, it's driven him crazy and his reps crazy there. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=928.2800000000001s)]
*  But I don't think Golden State's like hiding this amazing steady player from the rest of [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=931.6800000000001s)]
*  the league either with the way that they've yo-yoed him and out of the line. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=936.84s)]
*  He's probably a good stats, bad team guy, ultimately. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=940.84s)]
*  And there's a lot of guys like that. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=944.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Giddies Giddies, the weirdest one to me because. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=946.36s)]
*  I still really like him and he's young and he's had some success and I think he's [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=951.1600000000001s)]
*  competitive. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=955.16s)]
*  And I think for the most part, he's a winning player and his shot might get better as he [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=956.8s)]
*  gets older. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=960.6s)]
*  It was really good in the second half. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=961.9599999999999s)]
*  It's something to build on, something to be happy about. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=963.88s)]
*  I don't know if it's real. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=966.3199999999999s)]

*  Worst roster situations for each conference. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1040.44s)]

*  explain it. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1047.96s)]
*  We talked about this maybe a month ago when we argued about who does Indiana [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1049.32s)]
*  now have the best roster situation in the East. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1054.92s)]
*  And we went back and forth. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1058.4s)]
*  You settled on Cleveland. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1059.64s)]

*  Now I think Cleveland you'd probably pick, but going the other way with the [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1069.96s)]
*  worst, it's a good time to talk about it because we just had free agency. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1073.8s)]

*  What's yours? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1104.2s)]
*  Uh, man, just, just give me 20 seconds on it because there's like, sometimes it's [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1106.72s)]
*  Hey, who's the best player on these four bad teams because that's kind of the [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1113.24s)]
*  most important part. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1117.64s)]
*  So what do you care the most? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1119.28s)]
*  So if you have a great player, does that excuse some of the other stuff that [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1120.68s)]
*  would make you nervous? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1124.4s)]
*  Like the Milwaukee situation. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1125.1200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1126.92s)]
*  Do you have like one player? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1127.3600000000001s)]
*  Because we could do the same thing in the West and I'm going to head over [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1130.52s)]
*  so it's cause like, it's like, is it all flexibility? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1132.6000000000001s)]
*  Is it all cap space? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1134.88s)]
*  Is it all draft assets? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1135.92s)]
*  So I got to tell you, like, if you're telling me the next, the next four years, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1137.1200000000001s)]
*  five years, I don't want to be Toronto. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1142.8400000000001s)]
*  Uh, I don't want to be Toronto because even though Scotty Barnes is better [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1146.68s)]
*  than some of the other teams, best players, it's 38 and a half million for him. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1150.44s)]
*  It's 38 million for Brandon Ingram. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1155.0s)]
*  It's 32 and a half million for quickly. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1156.56s)]
*  It's 28 million for RJ Barrett. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1158.44s)]
*  Pertle who's fine, you know, 20 million. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1160.88s)]
*  That's going to go up with the extension. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1162.8s)]
*  They just extended him for another three. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1164.68s)]
*  They have five for, he's basically five for one 14. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1166.88s)]
*  Now you want to argue last year, Ingram didn't play RJ didn't crack 60 games. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1170.2s)]
*  Pearl didn't crack 60 games quickly played 33. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1175.0s)]
*  Scotty Barnes only played 65. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1177.92s)]
*  I think there's some Scotty Barnes numbers that are going in the wrong [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1179.6s)]
*  direction in an alarming way, but I'm not ready to just write him off as like [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1182.36s)]
*  somebody who's going to now like his best year ever was the second year. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1186.52s)]
*  And now it's all downhill. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1190.04s)]
*  So that doesn't seem entirely fair. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1191.0s)]
*  So even though I like Barnes better, there's, there's no moves here really for [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1192.24s)]
*  Toronto and all of these players other than RJ are under contract for the next three years. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1197.6799999999998s)]
*  I had them third on my list. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1203.48s)]
*  I don't like their, their top five guys. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1206.4s)]
*  I don't like any of the contracts for the top five. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1209.88s)]
*  And they did that. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1212.24s)]
*  So they did that Ingram move where that before the trade deadline, they traded [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1212.92s)]
*  some of the stuff they got for the Siachen trade forum, and then they gave him this [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1218.56s)]
*  extension of three years, 120, so 40 a year. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1222.1200000000001s)]
*  And then we get to the summer and like Nazarit's going for 25 miles. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1225.8400000000001s)]
*  Turner's going for 24. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1230.44s)]
*  And now it just feels like they shot their gun in a major way on that one. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1232.64s)]
*  And what does Brandon Ingram get in July? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1237.3200000000002s)]
*  If they hadn't done that extension, they must've been freaked that Ingram was the [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1240.64s)]
*  only like big time scoring wing, but you know, Ingram's another one of those guys [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1245.92s)]
*  that he'll get you the 20, but I just don't know, like, are you going to give me 20 [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1251.8000000000002s)]
*  in a big spot? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1257.8000000000002s)]
*  You're going to give me 28 in a big spot. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1258.5200000000002s)]
*  If I need you to be the number one scoring option, because there's some times [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1260.44s)]
*  in some big games where I feel like the guy gets pushed around. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1263.72s)]
*  So I'm thinking Toronto went, there's no good free agents. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1265.52s)]
*  And what if Brooklyn goes, but that's where you kind of have to go, Hey, Brooklyn, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1269.96s)]
*  Brooklyn wants to give him another 40 million a year when he's hurt. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1274.3600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1278.28s)]
*  Then, then maybe we have to take that risk. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1278.8000000000002s)]
*  You know, I don't know if that's why I'm a size not there anymore. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1281.64s)]
*  If they eventually were like, okay, we're paying you 15 million a year to run this [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1284.16s)]
*  team and now you're spending, they're doing a lot of a level spending on like [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1287.76s)]
*  B minus guys. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1292.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1294.08s)]
*  I think. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1294.32s)]
*  Did Mahoney say that somebody said this on my pod that they were top 12 just for [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1296.04s)]
*  salaries in the league, but you wouldn't say they had a top 12 roster. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1301.44s)]
*  It's kind of not where you want to be. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1305.96s)]
*  I thought the Ingram thing was an overpay. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1307.56s)]
*  I wouldn't want to pay Barrett 29 million a year quickly is 32 and a half years or [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1310.2s)]
*  32 and a half million each year for the next four. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1315.76s)]
*  Where in a league where like Clarkson's getting bought out and you're just, you're [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1319.1200000000001s)]
*  Callum sexting gets traded for NERC edge. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1323.88s)]
*  You have to attach a pick. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1325.84s)]
*  He's making 19 million. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1326.96s)]
*  So you think of that and it's like, that contract's awful. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1328.64s)]
*  I, I was on the record. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1331.28s)]
*  I didn't like the Barnes Max extension. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1332.72s)]
*  I understand what they had to do. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1334.3600000000001s)]
*  He's going to get it. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1335.28s)]
*  Like, I don't think he's going to get it for the bonds one. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1336.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, I just, that does make me feel good. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1339.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1341.68s)]
*  But as we were talking about, like the best thing is, is almost that rookie [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1342.0s)]
*  extension, that first rookie extension. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1346.24s)]
*  Cause you're like worried you might be wrong. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1347.92s)]
*  Like the Knicks didn't want to do this quickly number now. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1350.04s)]
*  And then they get OG out. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1353.44s)]
*  Now I don't know if there's a ton of teams that wanted to pay OG 200 million [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1354.92s)]
*  either because they are afraid of this injury history on top of everything else. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1358.52s)]
*  So, you know, maybe there's an argument here where it's like, Hey, you and [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1361.6s)]
*  Bill are completely wrong because this is more stable. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1365.0s)]
*  You know who your five guys are. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1367.88s)]
*  They didn't even play that many games last year together for whatever reason. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1369.68s)]
*  Five guys together. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1373.0s)]
*  Barnes Ingram quickly Baird and Pertle. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1374.6s)]
*  I would say I'd rather, the reason I picked them is I'd rather have worse [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1377.8s)]
*  talent and have more options the next two years, because I don't have any [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1381.48s)]
*  options with this unless Barnes turns into a superstar. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1385.44s)]
*  I like Grady Dick. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1389.04s)]
*  I think he he's a rotation guy. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1390.6s)]
*  Murray, Murray Bowles can't speak. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1392.4s)]
*  Murray Boyle, Murray Bowles. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1395.4s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1399.52s)]
*  Walter, some people like. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1400.92s)]
*  Agbaji had some moments. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1402.6s)]
*  Agbaji's expensive too. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1404.72s)]
*  But he had some moments. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1407.24s)]
*  Um, they have all their firsts. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1408.4s)]
*  I had them third. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1410.08s)]
*  My number one was Chicago. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1411.24s)]
*  I stared at it. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1413.2s)]
*  They still have this giddy RFA. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1414.92s)]
*  This is your least favorite one. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1416.48s)]
*  Yeah, here's why. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1418.6s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1419.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1420.36s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1421.76s)]
*  I don't love a single guy in their roster. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1422.8s)]
*  Maybe Bud Zelis. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1425.32s)]
*  Like at gunpoint. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1427.48s)]
*  I like Bud Zelis. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1428.72s)]
*  I don't, is he going to make it on NBA team? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1430.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1432.04s)]
*  Um, they have $85 million in expirings this season. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1433.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1437.2s)]
*  So you think like, Oh, look out for the bulls summer of 2026. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1437.84s)]
*  They just never been that team. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1442.16s)]
*  We've never seen it. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1443.52s)]
*  They didn't pay the luxury tax in forever. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1444.68s)]
*  Um, they have all their firsts. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1447.1200000000001s)]
*  I didn't, yeah, it's a small market, big market team. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1449.28s)]
*  I didn't like their first round pick this year. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1451.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't know why they didn't make the dare queen. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1453.1200000000001s)]
*  The Red Sox are like, what's the issue? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1454.72s)]
*  The Red Sox are like, I like what the bulls are doing. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1457.4s)]
*  I thought they should have made the dare queen trade. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1459.96s)]
*  Move back 11 spots, get, get new ones as first round pick. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1462.3200000000002s)]
*  But, uh, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1465.68s)]
*  it all depends on which version of the Derek queen trade you were offered is I [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1467.8400000000001s)]
*  think what the lesson is. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1471.3600000000001s)]
*  We'll never, we'll never know the answer is like, yeah, we would have done that. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1472.2s)]
*  If we had known it was unprotected, but we'll see, we'll see. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1475.76s)]
*  It'll be written in the books. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1478.96s)]
*  Um, Colby whites about to be a free agent. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1480.72s)]
*  That scares me. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1484.84s)]
*  Like what, what is his next contract? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1485.76s)]
*  Uh, that Patrick Williams in a Coro six, four for 72 for Williams, two for 22 for [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1488.56s)]
*  a Coro, they have some expirience, but I just don't know what this team is. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1495.1999999999998s)]
*  Like what's, where am I going the next three years? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1499.24s)]
*  I know I'm not going to be like a bottom five team next year. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1502.6399999999999s)]
*  Maybe I'll get lucky when the lottery, but, um, it's just, it just seems bleak to [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1505.7199999999998s)]
*  me. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1510.24s)]
*  Who am I selling to my face? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1511.8s)]
*  If I'm a bulls fan, what am I excited about? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1512.8s)]
*  My owners have already made it very clear to me. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1515.2s)]
*  We're never going to really spend money. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1517.6s)]
*  Um, I don't think free agents are going to be like, man, I'd love to go to Chicago. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1519.6399999999999s)]
*  They've done a shitty job with the Jordan legacy where you never hear a [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1523.48s)]
*  poor be like, I want to go to Chicago and reinvigorate the bulls. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1526.8799999999999s)]
*  That team really meant something. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1530.3999999999999s)]
*  I just don't really know what this team is other than a team that's going to go [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1532.6s)]
*  40 and 42 every year. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1535.84s)]
*  So that's my number one pick. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1537.52s)]
*  Yeah, this play in stretch where they just lose to Miami every year. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1538.76s)]
*  Like, yeah, you'd go through it and you're like, this is, this is kind of [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1541.84s)]
*  the same thing over and over again. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1544.92s)]
*  Uh, I think the Giddy trade will turn out to be a good trade for them. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1546.84s)]
*  You know, at the time they get killed, they don't get a draft pick, especially [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1551.4s)]
*  it's okay. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1554.8s)]
*  See, you know, it works for okay. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1555.32s)]
*  See perfectly. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1556.8s)]
*  Yeah, we defended them. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1557.6s)]
*  I think we're in the minority. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1558.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1560.08s)]
*  But Giddy was also like not super popular at the time either. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1560.4s)]
*  So it wasn't like there was going to be a bunch of people sticking up for him. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1563.8799999999999s)]
*  But yeah, the rest of the roster, I think at least the Bezellas piece, that's kind [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1566.36s)]
*  of what I would look for in this too is like, there's, there's some unknown. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1570.72s)]
*  That's exciting. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1573.92s)]
*  Like I would give you points for that. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1575.12s)]
*  And at least Bezellas is in that and, um, the Sangay, if you like what you saw [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1577.2s)]
*  from him in the bundas Liga, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1584.32s)]
*  Frank, Frank, Fran, for Shella just going in on him. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1588.24s)]
*  I really enjoyed it. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1590.72s)]
*  Did you see that? [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1591.48s)]
*  Every once in a while, Fran just goes nuts on the foreign, on the foreign players. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1592.12s)]
*  He was like, here's a guy who quit on his team played four minutes. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1596.24s)]
*  Uh, anyway, I did think that was pretty shocking, man, that he would just bail. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1601.6799999999998s)]
*  And then you would hurt, all of us had heard about it for like a week. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1606.12s)]
*  I'm sure you heard about it too. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1609.4399999999998s)]
*  And then no one had said anything and everybody was like, is he really going [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1611.32s)]
*  to do this? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1614.04s)]
*  Is he really going to go to the draft while his team is playing for him? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1614.6s)]
*  And then he would just go to the draft and then he would just go to the draft. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1617.4399999999998s)]
*  While his team is playing for championship. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1620.88s)]
*  And it's like the reason he's coming to the draft is because clearly the team has [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1623.0s)]
*  told him whichever team it is in the lottery, like we're taking you and it [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1625.92s)]
*  doesn't matter. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1629.3200000000002s)]
*  They, they didn't care that he wasn't going to play. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1630.4s)]
*  Um, so I don't know. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1633.76s)]
*  GM, would you make promises? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1634.92s)]
*  Yeah, I think, I think it's part of it. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1638.3600000000001s)]
*  I know you probably think you wouldn't, but would you do promises with, with [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1639.72s)]
*  caveats? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1643.76s)]
*  Well, what do you do if you make a promise to him at 12 and then Troy Weaver [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1645.6000000000001s)]
*  calls you and says, yo, we really want to move up. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1649.88s)]
*  We'll give you 23 in our unprotected pick next year for number 12. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1655.0400000000002s)]
*  And you're like, fuck, I made this promise to this French guy. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1659.7600000000002s)]
*  I can't. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1663.0400000000002s)]
*  I just wouldn't. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1665.6000000000001s)]
*  That's, I think that's the whole reason you don't do promises because you never [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1666.2800000000002s)]
*  know and Troy Weaver is calling you with some fucking asinine trade that you have [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1671.2s)]
*  to accept. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1674.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1676.2800000000002s)]
*  I mean, that's where you could say, Hey, you have a promise unless, you know, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1676.44s)]
*  something comes down the pike. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1680.16s)]
*  But then I think most GMs would tell you how many clients does the guy have. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1681.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1687.28s)]
*  But what's, but what's the upside of the promise that if you're worried that [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1687.92s)]
*  he's going to keep working out and then he'll move into the top 10, you won't be [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1691.2s)]
*  able to get him like you have to think that guy is incredible at that point. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1694.72s)]
*  They didn't, they'd have to think he's like a potential all NBA guy and just [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1698.48s)]
*  lock in on somebody that far away from the job. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1701.8s)]
*  I just wouldn't do it. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1704.92s)]
*  I don't get the upside. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1706.52s)]
*  I've heard about teams going back to the agent going, Hey, something changed. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1709.3600000000001s)]
*  Can we get out of the promise? [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1712.8s)]
*  And then the teams won't do it if the agent's going to lose, lose his shit about [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1714.92s)]
*  it. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1719.0s)]
*  I'm sure other stuff has happened. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1719.1200000000001s)]
*  Uh, I'm sure there's millions of stories I haven't heard, but when, um, like it [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1720.72s)]
*  was funny, there was a guy, there was a team that had a pick, but then their [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1726.28s)]
*  agents were saying that their guy was going there. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1731.2s)]
*  So like that was one of the rumors, like two weeks before the draft, it's like, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1734.24s)]
*  Hey, this guy has a lock. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1737.7600000000002s)]
*  He's promised here. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1739.1200000000001s)]
*  That's what, that's what everybody's saying. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1740.3200000000002s)]
*  And the pick got traded. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1742.1200000000001s)]
*  So it was like, Oh Jesus. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1743.7600000000002s)]
*  So either it was a conditional promise, kind of like what we're talking about [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1745.2s)]
*  here, or that guy was just full of shit the whole time and was trying to get [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1749.24s)]
*  people to maybe take the guy even higher than the slot. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1754.24s)]
*  So it's all part of it. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1756.8400000000001s)]
*  I have a little 45 second monologue for you about the bulls. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1759.0800000000002s)]
*  Good. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1762.68s)]
*  So I wrote in podcast about this in the early 2010s when the warriors were for [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1763.88s)]
*  sale, I can't remember their owner. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1768.88s)]
*  I think his name was like Chris Cohen. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1770.72s)]
*  Wasn't that his name? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1772.3200000000002s)]
*  So the guy who was sold and he sold to, uh, Lake and the price was high and [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1773.5200000000002s)]
*  people was like 360 and people were like, Oh my God, that's a lot. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1779.24s)]
*  And I went all in on, I think that's a great deal. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1782.72s)]
*  I think this is one of the best markets in the league. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1786.24s)]
*  I think their fans really give a shit. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1788.8000000000002s)]
*  I think their fans really give a shit. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1790.92s)]
*  And this has been a misused under owned asset that if the right ownership group [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1793.08s)]
*  comes in, they could really turn this into a major thing. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1798.72s)]
*  Well, you were there in the, in Boston, the early two thousands with the Red [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1802.0s)]
*  Sox, when it was just like that. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1805.84s)]
*  It was this misused, terribly owned asset that everybody thought like, if [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1808.4s)]
*  somebody can come in and do this correctly, there's this amazing fan base [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1813.16s)]
*  ready to pay any amount of money and everyone will go to the games. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1818.92s)]
*  Everyone's going to the games anyway. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1822.3200000000002s)]
*  Like if the right ownership group figures this out, holy shit. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1823.52s)]
*  I think the bulls are like that. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1827.8000000000002s)]
*  I think this has been it criminally misused asset for really since Jordan [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1829.96s)]
*  left when instead of going for the seventh title, they said, Oh no, we're [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1835.5600000000002s)]
*  going to rebuild, we're smarter than everybody. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1840.28s)]
*  And from that moment on, all they did was cheap out. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1842.16s)]
*  And, um, and basically they're in the third biggest city. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1845.5600000000002s)]
*  They're just cashing all this revenue that you get from being in Chicago, all [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1850.2s)]
*  of these people, these generations of people that grew up on the Jordan's [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1854.48s)]
*  bulls or remember the great days. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1857.64s)]
*  And so they keep their tickets and just kind of wait for something good to [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1859.48s)]
*  happen and nothing good is going to happen with these owners. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1863.8000000000002s)]
*  And I just feel like if I was like a kajillionaire, that would be the [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1866.3600000000001s)]
*  team I would try to buy. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1870.24s)]
*  Cause if you can reignite that team and rebuild them and tap into the Jordan [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1871.36s)]
*  DNA and Pippen and the, you know, bring those guys back and give Jordan a [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1876.68s)]
*  ceremonial position and really like ignite it, I think that would be a [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1880.68s)]
*  really special franchise. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1884.28s)]
*  And right now it's not, I think it's the worst situation in the East. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1885.56s)]
*  End of monologue. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1889.08s)]
*  Agree with all of it. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1891.76s)]
*  I do wonder what Jordan relationship would be because if he wanted to like [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1892.6399999999999s)]
*  hang out in the draft room on draft night, have him put it, be like, Hey [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1896.16s)]
*  Mike, we're not going to do this. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1898.96s)]
*  He's like, let me tell you about the Kwame Brown night. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1902.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1904.36s)]
*  We like, Hey man, you can have all the gear in the world. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1905.24s)]
*  You have some cigars. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1909.76s)]
*  I blow the smoke. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1910.96s)]
*  You're allowed to smoke inside. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1911.92s)]
*  You can have a golf cart wherever you want to go. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1915.04s)]
*  We just don't want a ton of input on draft night based on the, uh, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1917.32s)]
*  the scouting reports. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1920.84s)]
*  Here's 5% of the team. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1921.76s)]
*  Just go to, go to some games and be an ambassador for us. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1923.08s)]
*  But I think that's like a seven, eight billion dollar franchise. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1927.28s)]
*  Just sitting there. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1931.72s)]
*  Chicago is a massive city. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1932.72s)]
*  Like think about what's happened with the Cubs. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1934.8s)]
*  Think about like the bear. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1936.56s)]
*  Think about the fans. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1937.6s)]
*  Think about the people we both know from Chicago. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1938.48s)]
*  It's, I just can't believe they're this mediocre every year. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1941.4399999999998s)]
*  So you're on record right now saying you would rather have every other [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1945.36s)]
*  roster situation in the East ahead of Chicago. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1949.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1952.48s)]
*  Because I'm including the ownership situation. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1952.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1955.72s)]
*  I just don't, the only thing they have is the potential cap space a year [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1956.8s)]
*  from now and I don't think they'll give a shit. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1960.32s)]
*  So I have Chicago when you have Toronto number one, where'd you have [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1962.32s)]
*  Chicago in your rankings? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1965.24s)]
*  Were they in top four? [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1966.8s)]
*  No, because. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1968.8s)]
*  So who do you have second? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1971.48s)]
*  Well, this is where it becomes kind of like a debate of like is Washington's [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1974.6799999999998s)]
*  most valuable asset right now, Trey Johnson, that seems a little weird. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1980.9199999999998s)]
*  He's never played. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1985.72s)]
*  And yet we both like everything they're doing. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1988.76s)]
*  I like everything they're doing, but I mean, I wouldn't still a lot of [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1991.6s)]
*  other rosters I would rather have. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1997.9199999999998s)]
*  So you would rather have Chicago's roster and situation over, over [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=1999.96s)]
*  Washington's roster and situation. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2005.12s)]
*  Cause I think I, to me, no way. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2006.8799999999999s)]
*  I think that's crazy. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2009.1599999999999s)]
*  I would so much rather be Washington. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2010.2s)]
*  But there's not really, yeah, there's just not a lot on the team though. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2011.68s)]
*  Like you want to sell me on 110 million and expiring contracts next year. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2015.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2019.8400000000001s)]
*  So we just saw Brooklyn do that. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2020.3600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2022.96s)]
*  Middleton, smart homes, McCollum, Malinick, all expirings. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2023.44s)]
*  They got kiss bird on decent contract and they have a young nucleus of [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2027.04s)]
*  all guys that kind of like SAR. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2031.64s)]
*  I thought it looked a little Serge Ibaki last year. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2035.0800000000002s)]
*  We both like Trey Johnson and Michael Jackson. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2037.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2039.24s)]
*  The worst case scenario will be a 25 minutes a game, 16 minutes, 16 points [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2039.72s)]
*  a game, 40% from three, Bob Carrington. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2045.84s)]
*  I think we both liked. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2049.04s)]
*  Kim Whitmore. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2050.64s)]
*  We both like Kula Bali. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2051.44s)]
*  I feel like there's something there. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2052.92s)]
*  I like Kula Bali and Bob probably more than any of the players that are, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2054.24s)]
*  that have played in games for them. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2058.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2059.92s)]
*  I do think they, they do have a little bit of a, a little bit of a [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2060.16s)]
*  They have all their firsts. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2064.88s)]
*  They have a couple of good swaps and the big thing they have the 2030 and [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2066.0400000000004s)]
*  Phoenix with Phoenix, they can swap picks with Phoenix and, and cash in. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2069.8s)]
*  And that might be, I don't know, I think it's a, it's a little bit of a [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2076.5600000000004s)]
*  little bit of a, a little bit of a, a little bit of a, a little bit of a [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2081.6200000000003s)]
*  little bit of a, a little bit of a, a little bit of a, a little bit of a [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2086.2000000000003s)]
*  And cash in. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2092.12s)]
*  And that might be a good one. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2093.52s)]
*  So the draft pick situations, good, the salary cap for the first time. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2095.6s)]
*  When is Washington had a good seller cap situation? [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2100.68s)]
*  I can't even think of it in the last 15 years. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2104.12s)]
*  When they got Gilbert arenas was that 20 years ago? [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2109.48s)]
*  Um, and I think the guys that run the team know what they're doing. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2112.44s)]
*  I love the guys that run the team. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2117.2s)]
*  But I do think when you're trying to like gauge rosters going forward, like [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2119.1600000000003s)]
*  SAR might actually not be good too. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2123.92s)]
*  Would you allow that? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2126.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean, there's a chance that SAR is like, Oh, that didn't really work. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2127.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2130.28s)]
*  And then what is Bob? [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2130.92s)]
*  And then it's cool. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2131.94s)]
*  A Bali, like an energy guy, or is he a guy that you're like, is there one guy on [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2132.5600000000004s)]
*  this team, like the guy who may be getting you tasked with getting you buckets at [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2136.48s)]
*  the end of a game where it's tight. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2140.7200000000003s)]
*  Granted CJ could be there Middleton, whatever. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2142.2000000000003s)]
*  Is that on Chicago then? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2144.48s)]
*  Well, I still think Kobe white and Vuch and, and giddy. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2146.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2152.16s)]
*  Like there's, there's next year though. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2152.7999999999997s)]
*  I, well still like there, it was harder for me to go, Hey, 110 and expiring [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2155.08s)]
*  contracts, good draft capital coming in. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2160.4s)]
*  But the most valuable players, a guy who just went six in the draft two weeks ago. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2163.68s)]
*  Like that was hard for me to choose that. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2167.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's fair. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2169.2799999999997s)]
*  Over like, I'm not telling you, I love everybody on the bulls either. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2170.44s)]
*  We're in agreement, but I think there has to be something to set it's like, Hey, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2173.8s)]
*  there's a couple of guys that are actually like good and have played [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2177.8s)]
*  multiple years on that team. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2179.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2181.2000000000003s)]
*  Would you rather, would you rather have Washington's roster or the nets roster? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2182.28s)]
*  I had the nets second on my list of situations I wouldn't want to have. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2187.6000000000004s)]
*  And I know they have a bunch of fun picks. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2193.76s)]
*  Um, they have, so they got Porter and Terrence man for 54 and 56 [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2196.6400000000003s)]
*  million combined next two years. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2203.68s)]
*  Claxton's are one tradable asset. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2207.12s)]
*  I don't really love a single young guy on this team. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2210.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't even know if you asked me who my favorite net is. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2215.6s)]
*  I don't know what my answer would be. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2220.68s)]
*  I guess Nick Claxton. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2222.3199999999997s)]
*  That seems like a weird favorite player. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2225.3599999999997s)]
*  What's who's the, but who would you have as the best nets asset? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2228.04s)]
*  Who's the one you're driving at home about thinking like that's our guy. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2231.36s)]
*  He'll be on the side of Parkway someday. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2235.4s)]
*  Isn't it Cam Thomas is scoring. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2237.32s)]
*  I know you can't believe I just complimented cam Thomas. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2241.68s)]
*  So they have all their firsts. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2245.12s)]
*  They have a top eight, 2027 Philly pick. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2246.52s)]
*  They have three nine future picks. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2249.6s)]
*  They have a good, yeah. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2251.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2252.56s)]
*  They have three Knicks first, 27, 29 and 31. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2252.7200000000003s)]
*  And the only bad thing is they, uh, they have a swap with Houston in 27 where [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2256.0s)]
*  they lose the first. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2260.04s)]
*  So the, and what are the things with about like just throwing a season away? [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2262.0s)]
*  We just saw this happen in the lottery. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2267.2s)]
*  It doesn't necessarily guarantee anything because they change these lottery odds. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2269.0s)]
*  You saw Utah and Washington throw seasons away and get the fifth and six picks. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2273.2799999999997s)]
*  So when you hear about Brooklyn, they don't want to be good next year. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2277.84s)]
*  It's like, I don't know if they realize that doesn't guarantee jack shit anymore. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2280.2799999999997s)]
*  It got cool. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2285.44s)]
*  You'll get the fifth pick in the draft. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2286.08s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2287.68s)]
*  I at some point I'd rather, I'd rather have some combination of maybe some, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2289.04s)]
*  some young building blocks and I'm going to be bad anyway, just because there's [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2294.32s)]
*  so many good teams in the league or as much cap spaces, but they're like in no [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2298.16s)]
*  man's land. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2303.56s)]
*  I just, I don't understand what they did with all the cap space where they [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2304.6s)]
*  basically turned all of their cap space into Porter and Terrence Mann. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2307.7599999999998s)]
*  This, I thought it was really stupid and lost cam Johnson somehow. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2311.32s)]
*  My guess is they canvassed it. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2315.04s)]
*  That was the best they could do the unprotected, but I don't understand how [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2317.0s)]
*  they didn't get two assets because they did two things that helped the other team. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2320.56s)]
*  So we're just saying the same thing over here again. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2324.48s)]
*  But the problem is they're coming off of using five first round draft picks. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2328.16s)]
*  And there are a lot of teams that were like, if you were to say, Hey, you get [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2332.12s)]
*  five swings at it in this range, like you would have never thought that you were [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2337.2799999999997s)]
*  going to come up with those five players. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2340.72s)]
*  And who knows, I'm not going to be able to do that. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2342.2s)]
*  I'm going to have to go to four or five players and who knows, there's plenty [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2344.04s)]
*  of stuff that's wrong with the draft. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2347.24s)]
*  But Winnhorst was even saying for Winnhorst to share that other GMs were [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2348.48s)]
*  laughing during the night at what the nets were doing. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2352.44s)]
*  So you combine all of this together and it's like, okay, so you picked up a [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2356.08s)]
*  couple picks here, but your starting five is Yegor it's Cam if he's healthy, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2359.04s)]
*  that's your back court. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2365.4s)]
*  Ooh, Zyre who they will have at small forward, MPJ power forward and yeah, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2366.7599999999998s)]
*  20 million, it's declining contract. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2373.16s)]
*  He's still young. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2374.92s)]
*  That was kind of a weird thing because it seemed like they didn't really want to [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2376.32s)]
*  pay him, but they didn't want to lose the asset for nothing. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2378.44s)]
*  And then it's just all of these other guys. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2380.28s)]
*  Well, why not trade Claxton at this point? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2383.0s)]
*  If you're, if you're down this far down the road, trade Claxton, the Lakers or [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2384.88s)]
*  whoever, try to pick up a couple more assets. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2388.44s)]
*  I just think using Capspace and Cam Johnson to end up with Porter and one [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2393.48s)]
*  pick was insane. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2400.08s)]
*  That was my second, uh, that was my number two roster situation. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2401.68s)]
*  I wouldn't want to be. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2405.28s)]
*  So you had them third. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2405.96s)]
*  No, I like, I like Washington situation better than the nets. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2408.36s)]
*  So let me, if I'm doing this, yeah. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2412.0s)]
*  So I'm going to Toronto, Brooklyn, but this whole exercise is I was doing it. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2416.04s)]
*  I was kind of like, well, this doesn't feel, feel fair to Toronto. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2422.48s)]
*  If I'm qualifying, like, Hey, Chicago has a bunch of good, but I just don't like [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2425.92s)]
*  how expensive Toronto is for the next three years. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2430.4s)]
*  We have no rules. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2433.1600000000003s)]
*  It's just how you feel. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2434.28s)]
*  This is a, how do I feel in my gut with these rosters? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2435.92s)]
*  You think if the nets called in some hypothetical and called the Wizards and [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2439.12s)]
*  said, you can have everything we have, we'll swap situations, totally swap [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2443.7200000000003s)]
*  situations, Wizards are saying no, 10 out of 10 times hanging up. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2448.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2452.1600000000003s)]
*  We agree. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2452.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2454.96s)]
*  So I had Toronto third. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2455.88s)]
*  I had one team ahead of Washington in the number four spot and it surprised me. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2458.2s)]
*  And, uh, and I'm sure it's going to lead to some victory. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2462.9199999999996s)]
*  I'll come in my way over the next 24 hours. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2465.8799999999997s)]
*  Can't wait for that. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2467.8399999999997s)]
*  Don't tell me you pick Miami. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2469.24s)]
*  I did. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2470.7599999999998s)]
*  No way. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2471.56s)]
*  I did. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2473.8399999999997s)]
*  I flirted with it, but I was like, I can't, I can't. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2475.52s)]
*  And by the way, I liked some of the things they did, but, uh, they have this [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2477.7999999999997s)]
*  hero extension coming that I I'm just on pins and needles waiting to see how bad [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2482.3999999999996s)]
*  that contract is. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2486.76s)]
*  I think, especially when you've seen these numbers drop anything over. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2487.84s)]
*  What year one hero number, what number do you immediately start going like this? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2492.44s)]
*  Like that 40? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2499.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2501.2400000000002s)]
*  I think North of 40, you're like, why do you have to do this? [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2501.48s)]
*  39? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2504.44s)]
*  Well, what are the numbers? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2508.0400000000004s)]
*  Well, I'm just saying you're one, you're one of the hero extension. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2509.44s)]
*  So if it's in the 37 range, you're feeling half decent. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2512.4799999999996s)]
*  Let's say it's 37, 39, 41, 43, 45. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2516.64s)]
*  You're that's basically 200 million bucks. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2520.16s)]
*  Five years to 200. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2523.8399999999997s)]
*  He could do a four year two Oh seven. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2525.2s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2529.6s)]
*  Just that's where you just go. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2531.24s)]
*  No, or we don't have to do that. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2533.8799999999997s)]
*  Like, thanks for the buckets, man. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2536.2799999999997s)]
*  I just really good score. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2539.2799999999997s)]
*  You can't do that. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2540.9599999999996s)]
*  No, that immediately would be a top five worst contract. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2542.24s)]
*  And I like here. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2545.2799999999997s)]
*  And I think he's a very fun offensive player, but that's you can't BAMS 37 this [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2546.0s)]
*  year, 51, 55, 59 Wiggins is 28 and 30. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2551.12s)]
*  They just gave Mitchell. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2555.3599999999997s)]
*  I was okay with that 11 and 12 for the next two. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2556.6s)]
*  They have Roger as an expiring young players where Hakez, Yaka, Shoeness, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2559.12s)]
*  Jovich, uh, the alarming thing is there 27 first goes to Charlotte and that's [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2565.12s)]
*  just unprotected. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2570.96s)]
*  Uh, that makes me nervous. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2572.36s)]
*  And I think what really makes me nervous with this roster is I'm not sure. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2574.8s)]
*  If they pay hero, I'm not sure how you get to the late 2020s with a move. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2580.04s)]
*  And I know they pulled a rabbit out of the hat. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2586.68s)]
*  I'm always scared of the heat. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2589.08s)]
*  Some of the shit they've done, like convincing Portland, take us on white [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2591.28s)]
*  side, somehow ended up with Jimmy Butler, like getting LeBron and Bosch. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2594.6s)]
*  Like they've been able to do it over the years, but at some point, uh, the [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2599.12s)]
*  past is the past and the future is the future. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2603.08s)]
*  I don't know how you go up a level with this roster. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2605.3599999999997s)]
*  I don't know what the miracle move is. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2608.96s)]
*  As much as I like BAM, there's probably a conversation about him being 51, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2611.88s)]
*  55 and 60 million. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2615.44s)]
*  Like, is he that guy? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2618.56s)]
*  And then you compare it like that's where the hero extension seems even nastier [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2620.68s)]
*  because I probably like hero more now than I ever have because I think the [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2625.04s)]
*  shot making is that special, but it's pretty one dimensional and you know, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2629.36s)]
*  there's, if there's not somebody else to hide him defensively, it's a disaster. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2635.08s)]
*  As we've seen in the last two playoff rounds, I mean, they got smoked against [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2638.64s)]
*  Cleveland. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2643.72s)]
*  He was hunted, I think, as voraciously as any player in the East. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2644.16s)]
*  And they did it with the Celtics in that matchup last year. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2648.2s)]
*  They had, because they had to put the better defender on Tatum ended up with [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2652.48s)]
*  Jaylen Brown being guarded by hero. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2655.7999999999997s)]
*  You're like, Oh my God, this is, and you still had like some zombie heat stuff. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2657.68s)]
*  So if you're going 50, that's just a lot, like 101, 105 million with BAM and [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2661.7999999999997s)]
*  hero is your, is your top two guys. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2667.8399999999997s)]
*  And that kind of gets back to like, Hey, we're not a friend, you know, depending [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2669.7599999999998s)]
*  on whatever team you are, we're not afraid to spend, but it's like, how are [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2673.3999999999996s)]
*  you spending on your top three guys? [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2675.9599999999996s)]
*  That's, that's way too much for those two guys. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2678.72s)]
*  And I, and I actually like both players, but it's a problem when I, I like BAM [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2680.92s)]
*  and hero too, but when you just levitate above it and you go, all right, where's [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2685.88s)]
*  my ceiling with BAM and hero are my two best, most expensive players. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2689.56s)]
*  What am I winning? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2693.48s)]
*  And the answer is nothing. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2694.28s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2696.08s)]
*  LeBron is in this situation right now in the Lakers. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2696.84s)]
*  LeBron, like the, we talked about last week about those rich Paul LeBron wants [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2699.96s)]
*  to compete for titles. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2704.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2706.48s)]
*  Well, you have a team that has Luca Donchich on it. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2707.0s)]
*  Who's probably the best young offensive superstar that has come into the [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2709.56s)]
*  league that's a non-center in a long time. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2715.84s)]
*  And he was one of the best seven guys in the league. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2718.56s)]
*  You have role players, you have a good coach. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2720.96s)]
*  You were a three seed last year. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2724.76s)]
*  You're not a title contender. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2727.84s)]
*  Could part of that be that you're paying LeBron $53 million and he's 41 and you [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2729.52s)]
*  have to get nine months out of him. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2734.2400000000002s)]
*  I think that's a piece of it. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2735.4s)]
*  You know, so at some point, like, can you win a title if Luca LeBron and Reeves [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2737.1600000000003s)]
*  are your three best players and most of your salary cap and LeBron seems to [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2742.48s)]
*  think maybe not, but he's part of part of the issue because of what they're paying [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2746.84s)]
*  them and it's same thing with Miami. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2753.4s)]
*  Like if you have BAM and hero, I just don't know what the, what the ceiling is. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2755.2400000000002s)]
*  Round two. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2760.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2763.56s)]
*  I mean, that's why they were looking at Durant. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2764.32s)]
*  Although I guess they backed off on it this summer. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2766.0s)]
*  Um, [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2769.04s)]
*  then that we can just wait till next year floated around for Rui and then all [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2771.0s)]
*  these other Lakers pieces. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2774.84s)]
*  And I'm like, I'd rather have Rui than Wiggins. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2775.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2779.4s)]
*  I didn't understand. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2779.56s)]
*  What was that? [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2780.12s)]
*  Like Rui and Vincent and some other stuff. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2780.48s)]
*  So anyway, I have a connect that poor kid just hasn't been able to [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2782.88s)]
*  unpack his bags for months. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2786.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2789.48s)]
*  He's a, he's in a motel eight. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2789.64s)]
*  So I have Miami fourth. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2791.4s)]
*  Who else did you have in your top four? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2792.44s)]
*  Did you put Charlotte in there? [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2794.84s)]
*  I put Charlotte in there. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2795.92s)]
*  Um, you know, they won 19 games last year, third lowest in the league. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2797.48s)]
*  They have a million players on the books, by the way, too. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2804.52s)]
*  It is a shocking spot track. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2807.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2810.44s)]
*  It's you need, you need a break. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2811.0s)]
*  I forgot they have Josh Green. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2812.36s)]
*  Oh, there's Grant Williams. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2813.92s)]
*  And so if you look at LaMelo, he's 38, 41, 43 and a half, 46 and a half. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2816.04s)]
*  He's played 105 games the last three years. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2821.36s)]
*  And then with Mello bridges, Sexton's expiring Josh Green, Grant Williams, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2824.6800000000003s)]
*  Miller, they're all the next two years except for Sexton. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2829.4s)]
*  And again, Miller's not an extension yet. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2833.48s)]
*  So you could talk me into, Hey, Miller's nice. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2835.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, they, they, maybe they killed it in the drive with [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2839.5600000000004s)]
*  Kniepel and getting back in at the end of the first round. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2841.8s)]
*  But this Charlotte is in my top four as I would rather have Miami. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2845.84s)]
*  Cause at least if I'm paying Bam and hero, I'm paying, I'm paying guys that. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2851.52s)]
*  I know I'm top seer, but I like, I don't think I have to worry about them. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2856.56s)]
*  Where I think Mello is, unless it changes, and this isn't exactly new, but. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2861.12s)]
*  I think the franchise is somewhat held hostage to somebody who was really [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2868.4s)]
*  dynamic and fun and a fan favorite. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2872.7599999999998s)]
*  And it's like, all right, we kind of have something here. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2876.36s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, but you may have something that's like a worthwhile [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2878.68s)]
*  attraction that is also getting in the way of who you can be as a basketball team. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2881.04s)]
*  And if I were running a team that had to deal with that, like that's the stuff [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2886.88s)]
*  where I just think it's like, we're not making basketball decisions here. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2890.84s)]
*  We're making like entertainment decisions. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2893.44s)]
*  But if Charlotte called Miami and said, well, Che, do the Mello for hero. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2896.56s)]
*  I think Miami's cool. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2900.6s)]
*  Would call it in. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2902.0s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2904.24s)]
*  I mean, he doesn't, he misses a ton of games. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2905.08s)]
*  So even if you love them. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2907.24s)]
*  So, I mean, if, if you were Charlotte and they call Pat Riley and said, do you [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2909.08s)]
*  want our situation? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2913.2s)]
*  I was going to ask you that if Charlotte calls Pat Riley and said, we'll flip [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2915.52s)]
*  everything, every player we have and all of the draft picks we have for your [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2919.0s)]
*  entire situation, I think Miami says, yes, you do. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2923.2s)]
*  I do. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2928.36s)]
*  I think it's a better situation. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2929.32s)]
*  I get Lamello. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2931.28s)]
*  I get Brandon Miller. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2932.08s)]
*  I get Canipal. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2932.88s)]
*  I get bridges on a decent deal. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2934.36s)]
*  Maybe that's the guy. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2936.28s)]
*  Sexton, I get all these picks. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2937.92s)]
*  I get a Dallas first. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2940.2799999999997s)]
*  I have some calf space. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2941.56s)]
*  I think I'd rather have that situation. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2944.04s)]
*  I think I talked about this, uh, on the pod with you already, but I really like [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2945.92s)]
*  all this stuff Charlotte did where they're basically like the, just these [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2949.7599999999998s)]
*  little slight upgrade deals, you know, like, all right, we'll take, we'll help [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2953.12s)]
*  you out with Conaton and you can take me to buy them out and, um, and we'll take [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2957.4s)]
*  some stuff with that, but you know, nothing, nothing major, but just kind of smart. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2962.08s)]
*  Just seems like the boats rowing in the right direction finally for them. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2967.0800000000004s)]
*  Took a while, but it only took the entire decade. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2970.44s)]
*  Uh, all right. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2973.6000000000004s)]
*  Teams. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2974.1600000000003s)]
*  The ownership. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2975.48s)]
*  I think it's smarter, much smarter group and everybody would tell you the [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2976.5200000000004s)]
*  front office owners and Charles Lee. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2979.2400000000002s)]
*  So it was going to take a little while for you to feel it. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2981.6000000000004s)]
*  And, you know, I think the Lamello decision is a big one. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2984.6800000000003s)]
*  Uh, we'll see, maybe he's just healthy and plays well and there's more [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2989.8s)]
*  talent around him and it all kind of works out cause that'd be cool too. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2993.0400000000004s)]
*  Cause there's a lot of people that love them down there, but [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2995.6s)]
*  two honorable mentions for me. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2998.4s)]
*  We're we're Milwaukee and Indiana and I, I'm not willing to panic about Indiana. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=2999.96s)]
*  Um, I just think it's going to be one bad year for them, but they do [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3004.92s)]
*  have their first run pick. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3008.48s)]
*  They do have a bunch of guys on good contracts. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3010.04s)]
*  They have a great coach winning pedigree. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3012.24s)]
*  Halburn should be back in a year and whatever. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3014.6s)]
*  Um, so Milwaukee just quickly, cause I think that didn't make the top five for [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3017.28s)]
*  me. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3022.72s)]
*  And, uh, I'm already on the record as just how stupefied I was by the [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3023.56s)]
*  Dame thing and everything they did. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3028.24s)]
*  And, uh, it's interesting that the Bucks fans for the most part seem like. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3030.2799999999997s)]
*  They're fully supportive of what they did with the honest. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3036.16s)]
*  And I was trying, I was really trying to look at it from the other side. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3039.56s)]
*  Cause my, my instincts on it were so against it. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3042.2s)]
*  And I thought it was just so crazy because if you're going to do everything [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3047.04s)]
*  they did, but not locked down, Oh, they did all this stuff. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3050.36s)]
*  They now have no outs whatsoever, but now they're the second best team [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3055.96s)]
*  in the East. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3059.88s)]
*  Like you could get it. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3060.4s)]
*  They still have, I think the eighth best odds on Fandl with the East. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3061.44s)]
*  Eighth in the East, eighth in the East. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3065.36s)]
*  That's nuts. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3067.8s)]
*  They're 20 to one in the East. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3069.04s)]
*  So if you, so if you're going to do counters, I guess it looks like this. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3070.52s)]
*  Yannis doesn't want to go and they don't want to lose Yannis. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3078.4399999999996s)]
*  So they have a two year window with him and then he's got the player option. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3081.2799999999997s)]
*  So they're basically looking at it. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3084.52s)]
*  Like these next two years, like this Dame thing fucked us. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3085.7999999999997s)]
*  We have to figure this out. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3090.7599999999998s)]
*  We don't want to trade Yannis. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3092.16s)]
*  What can we do? [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3093.68s)]
*  So they save 14 million and 13 million for those first two years [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3095.4399999999996s)]
*  with the Dame Turner thing. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3098.9199999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3100.2799999999997s)]
*  So you can be like, okay, that's good. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3101.3199999999997s)]
*  That's positive. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3102.6s)]
*  We've saved money, even though we're paying out of our ass in the back way. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3103.3199999999997s)]
*  Turner on paper is a good center for Yannis, right? [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3107.8799999999997s)]
*  Can shoot threes shop, their defense is going to be good. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3110.64s)]
*  They really hurt the Pacers, which I think they hate the Pacers. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3115.3599999999997s)]
*  So I'm sure that was like a fun thing for them. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3118.9199999999996s)]
*  One thing I was thinking, and maybe I should have thought about this a few days ago, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3122.16s)]
*  but I think we both think Turner would have been a, maybe a third, if you're [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3126.2s)]
*  talking about overpaying Turner, maybe it's 130 for four years. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3129.68s)]
*  I wouldn't have blinked if that was the number, right? [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3134.16s)]
*  It would have been like, Whoa, that's high. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3136.2s)]
*  But I kind of thought it was going to be around there. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3137.3599999999997s)]
*  So they get him like 5 million a year cheaper. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3140.3999999999996s)]
*  Um, the East is wide open. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3144.3199999999997s)]
*  And you mentioned this on the pod with Bobby that with the cap jumping [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3145.96s)]
*  seven to 10% every year, maybe there is a little bit more of an NFL mentality [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3150.0s)]
*  where it's like, all right, we're going to lose 22 million a year, but the [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3154.64s)]
*  cap's going to go up like by the time we get to year five, maybe that's not [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3157.8399999999997s)]
*  that dangerous anyway, but the big thing is he did nothing. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3161.08s)]
*  You throw away Yannis here. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3163.72s)]
*  So I really tried to see it from their side. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3165.88s)]
*  I never would have done this. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3168.96s)]
*  And I just, I just want to make that clear again, but I understand [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3170.44s)]
*  like they're just, they're so far all in that at this point, it's like, Whoa, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3175.08s)]
*  everyone's getting fired anyway. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3179.6s)]
*  If this doesn't work out, we might as well try this. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3181.0s)]
*  I still wouldn't have done it. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3183.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3186.3599999999997s)]
*  My first thing on it was like, just knowing the Pacers, cause we had even [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3187.2s)]
*  mentioned this, I think just in passing, we didn't really dig into it, but I [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3191.68s)]
*  was like, I wonder if the Halliburton injury will be an excuse for that [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3194.92s)]
*  Pacers ownership group to then not pay the tax again, even though they had [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3197.4s)]
*  flipped the 25 pick for the 26, you looked at it like, Hey, that's a [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3201.48s)]
*  pretty smart kind of heady deal. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3204.52s)]
*  And it maybe means like they're going to go into the tax a little bit, but I [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3206.4s)]
*  don't know how the revenue split breaks down because like even going in the tax [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3209.8s)]
*  a little bit, then when you officially become a tax paying team, I know back in [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3213.7200000000003s)]
*  the day it was like, you're sacrificing millions, but you would have thought, [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3216.28s)]
*  Hey, they can't do this, right? [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3220.88s)]
*  They can't just a week and a half after being eliminated and came seven [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3222.28s)]
*  of the finals, they can't just let Turner go. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3224.72s)]
*  And then the more I thought about it, the more I, I actually was like, the [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3227.3199999999997s)]
*  only thing that impressed me about it was that Turner and his reps were able [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3232.08s)]
*  to pull this off, that they were able to find cap space for him that didn't [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3235.3999999999996s)]
*  exist through the stretch revision. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3239.9599999999996s)]
*  Because I, it reminds me a bit of like, I remember when the vooch trade was [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3243.24s)]
*  done to Chicago and a front office guy who's really good, we were talking [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3248.04s)]
*  about the trade and he said, you know, I just have, I think a good rule is. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3253.76s)]
*  If you're giving up those kinds of assets and they're giving up two first, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3259.4s)]
*  right, and they're giving up Wendell. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3262.44s)]
*  And yeah, that was, that was a lot to give up for food with two firsts. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3263.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3267.5600000000004s)]
*  So you're like, if you're going to do that kind of deal, you have to be able [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3269.1200000000003s)]
*  to say like, okay, we go from a first round exit to like a second round exit. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3275.0400000000004s)]
*  Or maybe, you know, we, we have the third best chance of being in the [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3279.44s)]
*  Eastern conference finals, right? [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3282.4s)]
*  We're not one, we're not two, but like, could we sit here and be [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3284.04s)]
*  realistic about it and say, Hey, we'll, we'll be in the top three of the [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3288.4s)]
*  East with this investment. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3293.52s)]
*  And it's like, when you look at the vooch deal, you go, yeah, we're probably [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3295.88s)]
*  the same team, we're probably the same team ceiling wise of what we can be in [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3300.04s)]
*  the East in the playoffs, despite, you know, vooch who puts up some numbers [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3304.52s)]
*  in theory, stretches of floor and all that kind of stuff. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3308.76s)]
*  This deal felt like it reminded me of that where it's like, okay, what were we [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3311.0s)]
*  before and now what do we guarantee ourselves? [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3314.96s)]
*  Like how much is the ceiling actually improved? [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3318.2799999999997s)]
*  Even though Turner's better than Brooke Lopez at this stage of their careers. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3320.92s)]
*  There's an argument. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3324.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3326.4s)]
*  As an argument to be made, it's like, you may not have guaranteed yourself [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3326.64s)]
*  advancing at all in the East and that's. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3330.24s)]
*  It's tough. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3337.0s)]
*  Fun. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3337.52s)]
*  I don't, I think the Dame thing combined with the situation in the room with [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3338.7200000000003s)]
*  the honest, they didn't have the luxury with the Celtics did, but I just, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3343.6800000000003s)]
*  when you look at their picks, which is the other piece of that, where they [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3349.48s)]
*  basically don't control any of their picks the next five years, they kind of [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3352.28s)]
*  don't have a choice at that point. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3355.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3356.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3357.08s)]
*  We're just like, well, what are we going to do? [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3357.6s)]
*  So hopefully miles Turner's awesome for us. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3359.08s)]
*  Hopefully we can patch together. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3361.32s)]
*  I mean, if they got your guy's CP for a year, not inconceivable. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3362.92s)]
*  Um, we'll see. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3371.08s)]
*  Um, okay. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3372.88s)]
*  We're gonna take a break and then we're gonna do the West. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3373.72s)]
*  All right. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3375.64s)]
*  The West, the number one is a little easier in the West. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3375.88s)]
*  I would assume we have the same number one, a team owned by, uh, the [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3380.08s)]
*  one, the only Matt Ishvia, Matt was one T. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3383.6s)]
*  I am going to ask you if this is the bleakest situation since the mid [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3387.3999999999996s)]
*  2010s Brooklyn nets after pro crops, like let's do one 80. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3392.52s)]
*  I know we don't have any picks, but I don't want to spend money anymore. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3397.3999999999996s)]
*  Uh, is this the worst situation since then? [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3400.24s)]
*  Uh, I don't think it's that bad. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3404.9599999999996s)]
*  Is it still a booker? [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3410.2s)]
*  You still have Booker? [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3414.48s)]
*  All of their picks are gone or swapped until 2031. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3416.48s)]
*  And that picks gone too. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3420.92s)]
*  I think that goes to Utah. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3421.92s)]
*  They have Booker lockdown. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3425.96s)]
*  They're going to buy Beale out apparently in the next 24 hours for some crazy price. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3427.4s)]
*  Jalen green three for one Oh five. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3434.08s)]
*  I don't think either of us would want to pay that Brooks for two years. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3435.7599999999998s)]
*  Grayson Allen and Rose O'Neill double figures for the next couple of years. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3441.16s)]
*  They have the two Charlotte centers and they're going to be paying Booker [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3445.28s)]
*  like $75 million a year on a new extension. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3450.08s)]
*  And then probably what nine months from now is good. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3454.64s)]
*  Like, Hey guys, I can use, send me to a winning team now. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3457.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3460.16s)]
*  It seems to be, he seems to be like to totally into the Phoenix thing. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3460.56s)]
*  So I, I don't know. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3464.68s)]
*  I can't predict how he's going to feel other than he's felt like a really good [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3466.3199999999997s)]
*  partner as the face of the franchise, as opposed to some other guys. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3470.68s)]
*  Uh, they're going to be a lottery team without a pick and I don't see any path [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3474.48s)]
*  forward. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3480.36s)]
*  I don't, I mean, Mali, it's Mali actually would have to be a, like a revelation [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3480.7999999999997s)]
*  for me to feel better about this situation. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3487.92s)]
*  Like a revelation where we're like, Holy shit. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3490.88s)]
*  This is like watching Ewing in Georgetown. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3493.04s)]
*  It says QF the 85 viewing highlights. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3496.4s)]
*  He's back. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3499.36s)]
*  Yeah, that would be a little surprising. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3504.0s)]
*  Although, you know, I did, I did like him. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3505.92s)]
*  Uh, yeah, this is just one of those it's back to the no outs things. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3509.88s)]
*  Like Booker's still better. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3514.24s)]
*  Booker's better than anyone on Utah. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3515.68s)]
*  Booker's better than anybody on Portland. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3517.52s)]
*  Booker's better than anybody on New Orleans. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3520.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3522.96s)]
*  San Antonio, you know, that's probably not a conversation just because of what [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3523.68s)]
*  we think of Wemby, but it's, uh, the only argument you have here is, is Booker's [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3527.36s)]
*  talent level then surrounded by no options and it's expensive. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3534.2400000000002s)]
*  Who do you have number two? [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3541.8s)]
*  Sacramento. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3544.96s)]
*  I had them as well. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3546.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't know that you realize how bad it is until you go through the exercise. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3548.76s)]
*  I was stunned. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3552.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3553.68s)]
*  So it's Levine and Subonis are a cool 90 million. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3554.08s)]
*  Um, and then 94 in a year from now. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3560.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3564.36s)]
*  Like Miami fans should be going, well, at least we're not doing that with [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3564.68s)]
*  Banner Hero, right? [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3568.04s)]
*  Oof. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3569.24s)]
*  So you've got Subonis, Levine, DeRozan who, you know, look, DeRozan at 25 and [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3569.68s)]
*  28 million is fine. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3576.88s)]
*  Like a guy just seems to age really well. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3578.48s)]
*  Monks at like 40 million in the next two years, but it's 133 and a half [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3580.16s)]
*  million for those four guys this year. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3584.64s)]
*  It's 142 and a half million next year for those four guys. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3586.08s)]
*  Um, then here's Dennis Schroeder for three for 44. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3589.3199999999997s)]
*  Let's throw him in there. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3593.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3595.16s)]
*  I went out at the time though. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3595.48s)]
*  I would have rather done that deal than the Laverte deal. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3596.64s)]
*  Cause I just think Schroeder can find ways to help in multiple ways, but [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3599.3199999999997s)]
*  it's just not a very exciting team. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3603.72s)]
*  You have, I think the least winning top paid player on a team, a guy that, I [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3605.68s)]
*  mean, none of this is again, new on my Levine stuff, but that's, um, that's [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3612.8s)]
*  a team that is fucked. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3617.2s)]
*  Well, and Keegan Murray, who they're going to have to make a decision on an [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3619.84s)]
*  extension at some point. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3623.92s)]
*  And I just feels like he's gotten worse the last two years where they felt like [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3625.2400000000002s)]
*  there was something there. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3629.92s)]
*  I'm not seeing it. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3630.72s)]
*  They have, they have their own first. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3631.52s)]
*  They have a mini 2031 and they have a top eight San Antonio first. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3633.76s)]
*  So they have stuff to trade. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3637.76s)]
*  I, there was, Zach floated this out a couple of times that this seemed like a [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3640.44s)]
*  possible Jalen Brown overpay team. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3644.32s)]
*  Um, I still feel like if you're going to make the, if we're going to do an [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3647.28s)]
*  overpay who's most likely to just do a complete crazy overpay trade fantasy [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3651.0s)]
*  draft, I think I would have them first. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3655.5200000000004s)]
*  Cause they're, they're like Chicago and no man's land, but they don't want to [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3658.6000000000004s)]
*  be a no man's land and they're ready to do stuff. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3662.4s)]
*  I just don't think the opportunity has presented itself, but, uh, it's a weird [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3664.6800000000003s)]
*  one. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3670.6s)]
*  I just don't like their roster. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3670.76s)]
*  I don't like the guys together and they don't really have a lot of outs with it. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3672.08s)]
*  You know, the DeRozan contract last year made sense when they did it, but now, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3676.12s)]
*  you know, is if you called Atlanta and said, Hey, you want to take the [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3680.96s)]
*  Rosen in your trade exception? [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3683.64s)]
*  I just don't think Atlanta would do it. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3685.2400000000002s)]
*  So, uh, yeah, I had them second as well. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3687.96s)]
*  Sure. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3691.08s)]
*  They can move DeRozan if they want to, cause I still think the Rosen, like I [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3691.3199999999997s)]
*  cannot believe how productive he still is, but it's, you do it for Norm Powell. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3695.16s)]
*  Um, you know, I think norm, I probably, I'd probably rather pay norm cause he's [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3700.56s)]
*  younger and I would give, uh, I would say his injury stuff last year is what [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3706.24s)]
*  derailed, what was like an insane start for him. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3710.6s)]
*  So, uh, and norm's a better shooter from three. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3714.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3718.2799999999997s)]
*  I'd rather have norm too. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3718.84s)]
*  Who'd you have for your third team? [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3719.7999999999997s)]
*  This, I thought number three was tough. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3722.04s)]
*  It was pretty clear that Phoenix was one and Sacramento was two. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3724.08s)]
*  And then third, I thought, uh, I thought it was a hard one. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3728.36s)]
*  See the way you're going with this, I feel like you're going to say Pelicans now. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3734.2799999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3740.08s)]
*  You know me, you know me so well. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3740.4s)]
*  That's who I had. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3743.24s)]
*  All right. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3744.24s)]
*  So give me the Pelicans argument. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3744.52s)]
*  It's a team of assets that I like that make no sense together. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3745.96s)]
*  I don't think they're going to be good next year and they don't have their pick. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3751.76s)]
*  And I think my favorite asset of everybody they have is Troy Murphy [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3756.8s)]
*  at four for one 12, Herb Jones, two for 29. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3762.0s)]
*  Um, I said Troy Murphy, Trey Murphy. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3765.64s)]
*  Sorry, Trey. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3771.76s)]
*  I said Troy Murphy, Trey Murphy. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3772.7599999999998s)]
*  Sorry, Trey, Trey Murphy. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3774.7599999999998s)]
*  Remember Troy Murphy? [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3777.16s)]
*  My dad always liked them. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3778.36s)]
*  His cap hold is still my dad. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3779.7999999999997s)]
*  I always enjoyed Troy Murphy, Trey Murphy, four for one 12 Jones, two for 29. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3781.2799999999997s)]
*  They've queen and fears and Hawkins and Missy, you know, some good young talent. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3786.16s)]
*  Murray coming back up in Achilles. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3791.52s)]
*  They have Jordan pool for two years for reasons that remain unclear. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3793.2s)]
*  And then this weird Zion situation. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3797.04s)]
*  And it's like there's Zigg and Zagat at the same time by trading your pick. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3799.6s)]
*  You're telling us you think you can compete for a top six playoff spot. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3804.88s)]
*  And yet looking at the raw at the West, I don't see any chance that happens. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3808.84s)]
*  I like a bunch of the guys. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3815.44s)]
*  So. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3817.0s)]
*  Me too. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3818.52s)]
*  Saying this is third worst. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3818.88s)]
*  It's more a reflection of the West than, than them. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3821.6s)]
*  Cause I don't think they would be top five worse than the East. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3824.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3828.3599999999997s)]
*  But like, let's just play it out. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3828.52s)]
*  Why is this worse than Utah? [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3829.64s)]
*  Um, cause all those picks Utah has combined with, uh, [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3833.3599999999997s)]
*  they have two first out of their own Minnesota and Cleveland and 27, 29. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3844.16s)]
*  They've got a Lakers top four protected 27. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3848.24s)]
*  They've got the unprotected Phoenix 31. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3851.2799999999997s)]
*  They've got a swap with Minnesota or Cleveland and 28. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3853.7999999999997s)]
*  Another swap or excuse me, in 26 and then another Cleveland swap in 28. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3857.5600000000004s)]
*  But it's weird. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3863.5600000000004s)]
*  I guess I'm factoring in like Utah knows what they're doing more. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3864.28s)]
*  Maybe that shouldn't factor into this. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3867.5200000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3869.76s)]
*  But if we're going like through the Utah players. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3869.96s)]
*  So you'd rather have the new Orleans players in the Utah picks. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3873.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3878.6800000000003s)]
*  Who's the best asset? [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3882.7200000000003s)]
*  Give me the, give me the three best assets on Utah. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3883.84s)]
*  Marking. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3887.1600000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3888.5200000000004s)]
*  Probably ace Bailey just cause of where they picked them. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3891.6400000000003s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3894.92s)]
*  Go back to the Washington thing. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3895.32s)]
*  Kessler. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3896.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3899.0400000000004s)]
*  It gets bleak fast. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3899.36s)]
*  Hendricks Clayton Jr. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3900.76s)]
*  Well, New Orleans has two cap killer assets in, in Murray coming off of his [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3903.2000000000003s)]
*  injury and then Jordan poll who they willingly traded for, for 66 million [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3910.0800000000004s)]
*  for two years, they were like, sure. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3915.96s)]
*  Um, I, uh, and they have a bunch of young players. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3918.56s)]
*  I actually think the way they built their roster is going to be [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3923.6s)]
*  counterproductive because it's too many guys and none of them [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3926.64s)]
*  have really proven anything. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3929.2s)]
*  So you have all these different assets. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3931.52s)]
*  Like Trey Murphy is going to be like, I'm ready to have an awesome year [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3933.2400000000002s)]
*  and be discussed in a real way. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3936.56s)]
*  Herb Jones is like, I'm ready to do all her Jones things on a good team. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3938.76s)]
*  Zion has been in the league now six years. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3943.2400000000002s)]
*  What's when is the Zion? [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3946.88s)]
*  Hey guys, I'm laying the smack down. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3948.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't know what to make of this team. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3950.76s)]
*  Um, Zion is in this, in his career. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3952.84s)]
*  It's just always worth reminding everybody this 24 games, 61 games, [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3955.96s)]
*  zero games, 29 games, 70 games where you got hurt in the plan against [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3960.36s)]
*  the Lakers when he had 40 and then 30 games last year. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3965.44s)]
*  So it's, it's a lot like the Lamello thing where you have this thing and [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3969.08s)]
*  you're like, okay, but you're just waiting around for him. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3975.24s)]
*  I mean, if he's healthy somewhere, honestly, if he's healthy somewhere else [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3979.08s)]
*  and puts up some big numbers, then so be it. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3981.68s)]
*  You got to move on from this. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3985.08s)]
*  There is a New Orleans stink that is it's hard to separate it from the situation [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3985.68s)]
*  because being in New Orleans with how dysfunctional that organization and [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3990.12s)]
*  city and ownership has been year after year after year, if you just basically [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3993.8399999999997s)]
*  took all this stuff and put it with a better infrastructure and everything [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=3997.52s)]
*  around it, you might be in better shape, but you know, it's just year after year [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4003.2s)]
*  in that city with the, with the, you know, I don't know. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4009.08s)]
*  I mean, you read that piece this week about [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4014.96s)]
*  called Atlanta kept asking them over and over again. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4019.6s)]
*  So it's an unprotected pick, right? [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4024.08s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, yeah, it's I'm protected. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4026.2799999999997s)]
*  It's like, just one more time. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4027.6s)]
*  It's unprotected, right? [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4029.24s)]
*  Like you hear stuff like that. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4030.84s)]
*  And like, holy shit. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4032.32s)]
*  How does, how does this team even suit up 82 times? [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4034.0800000000004s)]
*  How do they even coordinate the travel correctly? [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4036.96s)]
*  And these are the new guys, cities. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4039.88s)]
*  These are the new guys. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4042.0800000000004s)]
*  So it's basically weavers running the team for Dumars and weaver. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4043.28s)]
*  Like, I don't think could have done a worse job for the pistons. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4047.2000000000003s)]
*  Could he have done a worse job? [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4051.28s)]
*  I'm not, that was one of those, like, I'm not positive that guy was [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4054.0800000000004s)]
*  going to get another job. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4056.76s)]
*  All right. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4059.1600000000003s)]
*  So who'd you have third? [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4059.36s)]
*  If it was New Orleans, you had Utah. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4060.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4064.2000000000003s)]
*  Cause I like Trey Herb and the potential of Zion. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4064.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4070.04s)]
*  It's a three, three B. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4070.8s)]
*  There's, that would be an interesting one. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4072.36s)]
*  I think Utah would probably say, we're fine. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4075.1200000000003s)]
*  We have all of these picks. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4078.4s)]
*  We, you know, if Taylor Hendricks turns out to be something Clayton or [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4080.44s)]
*  Chianti turn into something, maybe, I mean, you know, it's a good argument. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4086.3199999999997s)]
*  It's I think those are the three and four in some order. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4091.3999999999996s)]
*  And then I couldn't believe I had this team in the top five, but I kind of ran [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4094.3999999999996s)]
*  out of teams because the West is, but I think it's the Clippers. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4099.679999999999s)]
*  I think they have to be fifth, even though I think that's a, I think they're [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4105.679999999999s)]
*  potential round three playoff team this year, but I just like big picture. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4112.24s)]
*  Kawai for two more years, 50 and 50. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4117.76s)]
*  They're paying Kawaii and hearted 90 and 92. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4120.5599999999995s)]
*  They pound Bogdanovic on expirings. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4124.12s)]
*  That's about it. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4126.08s)]
*  Not a lot of leverage with the roster. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4126.679999999999s)]
*  Um, they have some, some couple of positive pick stuff and a couple lousy pick [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4129.2s)]
*  stuff, including, um, a Philly swap. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4136.16s)]
*  They're 28 goes to Philly and stuff like that. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4139.0s)]
*  Um, they do have 26 million on the cap in 27, 28. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4141.76s)]
*  I listen in the East, it's, they would, wouldn't even sniff the top five, but I [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4146.32s)]
*  was just trying to think of like, what situation could potentially just go [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4149.72s)]
*  badly and you have to go with them or Golden State because Golden State is [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4153.04s)]
*  basically this two year runway. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4157.679999999999s)]
*  Now they're on the cap in the summer of 27, they'll have $23 million [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4159.4s)]
*  employers in the cap, so they're open for business in all of these ways. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4164.639999999999s)]
*  But that could also go horribly. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4168.76s)]
*  You know, and maybe short term at my time. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4171.2s)]
*  So it's one of those two, I think in that spot, cause I can't put Portland. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4173.72s)]
*  I like the Portland five year situation over both of those teams. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4178.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4183.28s)]
*  I went through and did Portland stuff. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4183.48s)]
*  Um, you know, Grant's done all the books for 32, 34 million the next two years. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4185.36s)]
*  And you forget he's on the team, but I think between. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4189.599999999999s)]
*  Like if you look at the drew, you didn't like the drew contract either drew three [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4193.88s)]
*  for a hundred basically, and then the grain, I was honestly, I was shocked [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4197.0s)]
*  that they did that. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4200.88s)]
*  But, uh, [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4201.6s)]
*  if you were right, it's starting to look worse now that we've seen some of the [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4203.64s)]
*  free agent money that drew is going to make that with some of the other prices [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4207.08s)]
*  that guys got, maybe that I might've been wrong in that one. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4213.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4217.320000000001s)]
*  But you kind of were right because they got an asset out of it where I thought [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4217.4800000000005s)]
*  that's clearly a pick in a dump. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4221.84s)]
*  I would've thought they were going to have to attach a pick to it. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4224.76s)]
*  And then the Celtics were just super confident. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4226.84s)]
*  Like they did a really good job. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4228.6s)]
*  They came into the market. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4229.52s)]
*  You had heard they, they've got a landing spot for this guy, but if they [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4230.8s)]
*  don't need to do it that way, they could do this thing first. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4234.200000000001s)]
*  And then, you know, they, they got out of a ton of money and saved [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4236.240000000001s)]
*  themselves a ton of money and they still have the flexibility back. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4239.68s)]
*  Like I think Nying's a rotation guy and a good team. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4242.4800000000005s)]
*  Um, I think Simon's allows you to get creative or you could just say, why [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4245.4800000000005s)]
*  don't you score some points? [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4250.64s)]
*  I don't know what they're going to do with them, but you could, you could see [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4251.400000000001s)]
*  them having like an okay season where he's scoring a ton off the bench. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4253.72s)]
*  And they're just like, look, you're a scorer and you can find much [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4257.200000000001s)]
*  better shots. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4259.48s)]
*  So look, I think if you go through Portland stuff, you go, okay. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4260.16s)]
*  The picks are where it gets really good. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4264.639999999999s)]
*  Sharp feels like a nice, like maybe Denny's looked like he's going to be good. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4266.639999999999s)]
*  I think Scoot took a step in the right direction still needs to be better [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4272.24s)]
*  for him to match kind of our excitement. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4275.919999999999s)]
*  Kamara, I love Klingon. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4278.2s)]
*  You know, I don't, I don't know if Chris Murray's getting the world excited [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4280.879999999999s)]
*  about it, but there's at least like among the five new guys that are in there. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4283.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4287.639999999999s)]
*  There's kind of some hope where even with some of these other teams that are bad, [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4288.0s)]
*  you can't, you've probably given up on three of three of the six or seven young [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4291.96s)]
*  guys already, if that makes any sense. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4297.08s)]
*  They have Milwaukee swaps in 20 and 30. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4301.2s)]
*  They can keep the best version of Boston or Milwaukee in 29. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4304.48s)]
*  They have all their own picks. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4308.36s)]
*  It's pretty good. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4310.72s)]
*  And, and I think they're going to be a really interesting, wouldn't be shocked [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4311.32s)]
*  if they went like 47 and 35 type of team this year, just cause I think their [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4317.16s)]
*  defense is going to be really good. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4321.24s)]
*  And it's going to hinge on our guy. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4324.36s)]
*  We have a ton of Scoot stock. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4328.36s)]
*  Um, it's going to hinge on how good offensively he can be for them. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4329.72s)]
*  But, uh, I kind of liked the team. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4333.96s)]
*  I think they have an identity. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4336.639999999999s)]
*  I think that's a really hard thing to do when you're a lottery team, to build a [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4337.8s)]
*  type of group of players that seem like they actually fit together, which I [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4341.12s)]
*  don't think New Orleans has. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4344.84s)]
*  Um, it'll be interesting though, cause there was one number that showed kind of [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4348.16s)]
*  an outlier opposing three point percentage in the second half and that may every now [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4354.32s)]
*  and then you'll see some weird outlier opposing three point percentage where you [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4361.4s)]
*  go, Oh, that's what happened. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4365.76s)]
*  Like, were they really good defensively or did they just get really lucky in [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4368.08s)]
*  opponent's makes? [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4371.12s)]
*  So that'd be something that I'm like looking for the first few months of next season. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4372.2s)]
*  Would you rather be Golden state or the Quippers the next five years? [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4377.16s)]
*  Golden state. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4381.84s)]
*  Cause you get short-term Curry, long-term cap space. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4384.04s)]
*  Curry's the best partner in his era in basketball. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4387.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4390.48s)]
*  And I don't have to worry about the bullshit that you have to worry [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4391.2s)]
*  about with everybody else. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4393.92s)]
*  You know, I agree. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4395.44s)]
*  The only other team I looked at was Memphis just cause of, uh, they gave [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4396.4s)]
*  Jaren that extension, he immediately got hurt. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4400.8s)]
*  Um, John Moran. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4403.4s)]
*  Just shows how much he's built different though. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4405.64s)]
*  He's just outgrinding. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4407.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4408.72s)]
*  Is that non-sanction hoops? [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4408.92s)]
*  John Moran. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4411.0s)]
*  No idea what to expect with him. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4412.4s)]
*  Contracts are fine. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4415.12s)]
*  I like some of their young guys. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4416.32s)]
*  They have all their first plus two Orlando first. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4417.68s)]
*  So they didn't, they didn't make it. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4419.56s)]
*  And then I did look at the Lakers situation for a second, just cause. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4421.32s)]
*  Not when you have one of the three best, it's kind of the [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4426.2s)]
*  honest thing in Milwaukee. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4427.84s)]
*  Like it can be a mess and granted the Lakers future met, but there, there has [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4428.96s)]
*  to be some point of these conversations where we look at each other and go, Oh, [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4433.48s)]
*  you have one of the three best players in the world. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4436.4s)]
*  Here's why I paused. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4438.5199999999995s)]
*  He is, he is, uh, does not have an extension yet. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4440.2s)]
*  It's the only thing that made me pause. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4447.639999999999s)]
*  How happy are you going to be if he decides to sign somewhere else? [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4449.0s)]
*  I don't see any scenario where that happens, but I also, if I was a Laker fan, [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4453.719999999999s)]
*  I would be sleeping with one eye open until it happens. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4458.719999999999s)]
*  Who knows? [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4463.24s)]
*  There's going to be a lot of teams with calf space. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4465.08s)]
*  Give me now that now that everyone's figured out the system. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4467.759999999999s)]
*  I mean, one of the things I just think the way they, and we've been talking [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4471.44s)]
*  about it for two years, but they do the, they change these CBAs and they immediately [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4475.08s)]
*  put in the new rules and these teams who have been doing whatever they've been [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4478.639999999999s)]
*  doing, and then all of a sudden it's like, Hey, the rules have changed. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4483.48s)]
*  It's like, okay, cool. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4485.839999999999s)]
*  Well, we didn't know that when we made all the decisions we made the last two [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4487.5599999999995s)]
*  years, like the Celtics and other teams. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4490.5199999999995s)]
*  But I think by the time we get to 26, 27, everyone's going to have a feel for. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4492.719999999999s)]
*  All right. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4497.16s)]
*  If I create calf space and I do this and I can make, so he, he's, that could be [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4497.5199999999995s)]
*  a really good phrase and sweepstakes. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4503.12s)]
*  My assumption is he'll sign an extension in August. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4504.679999999999s)]
*  I'd be shocked if he didn't, but who knows? [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4507.879999999999s)]
*  Would it be like a wild card round for the Pats or Red Sox? [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4513.16s)]
*  If Luca didn't sign. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4519.0s)]
*  That's not on the level of a banner. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4521.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4522.68s)]
*  So would I trade the Pats? [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4524.12s)]
*  Could it make the playoffs for five years? [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4525.52s)]
*  If, but Luca leaves the Lakers, would I take that? [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4528.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4532.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4532.56s)]
*  I think I'd go three years. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4533.96s)]
*  Five's a lot. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4537.84s)]
*  Five's like a half decade. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4538.88s)]
*  I'm old. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4540.04s)]
*  Cause you're still so mad that they got him, which is totally understandable. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4540.92s)]
*  There's been some benefits though. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4546.52s)]
*  It definitely created one of the most bizarre LeBron situations. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4548.36s)]
*  I think that's been pretty fun. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4554.0s)]
*  I still don't really get the LeBron thing, you know, because I think it's [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4555.28s)]
*  actually as simple as it needs to be on its surface. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4558.76s)]
*  It's like, so you were mad you didn't get the extension. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4562.28s)]
*  So you opted in. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4565.24s)]
*  So there was nothing else for you to do. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4567.2s)]
*  There was nowhere for you to make that money. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4568.64s)]
*  And now what? [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4570.32s)]
*  Like somebody's going to hear from you about it. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4572.12s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4574.4800000000005s)]
*  That one's still a weird deal a week later. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4575.32s)]
*  I think it's as simple as this. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4579.0s)]
*  He is the best NBA player ever to be in a situation like this where [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4582.5599999999995s)]
*  he's on somebody else's team. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4587.88s)]
*  I think it's really that simple. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4590.599999999999s)]
*  Like if I go through the best guys of all time that I have, you know, going, [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4592.08s)]
*  going down from like Jordan was never in the situation. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4599.72s)]
*  Bill Russell, never Kareem, never magic, never bird, never Duncan, never [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4605.68s)]
*  will Chamberlain got traded twice, but, but even near the end, like they, [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4611.84s)]
*  they won the title in 72 he was on the Lakers. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4616.96s)]
*  He went to the ABA, like he was always controlling his own destiny. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4619.4400000000005s)]
*  He was always controlling his own destiny. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4621.92s)]
*  Curry, Kobe, Jerry West. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4624.16s)]
*  You finally get to like Hakeem. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4628.76s)]
*  It's like the first great guy who was like, Oh shit, my team doesn't really seem [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4630.6s)]
*  like they want to build around me and, and have it be my team anymore. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4635.72s)]
*  So I think that's a really hard thing to deal with. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4640.32s)]
*  It's been in the league 23 years from the moment Luca showed up. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4643.08s)]
*  And then it was like, Luca, Luca, Luca, and there's jerseys in the thing. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4647.24s)]
*  And they're changing their style on the fly to kind of fit what Luca does. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4650.639999999999s)]
*  I don't know if he was a huge fan. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4655.36s)]
*  You could kind of see it. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4658.839999999999s)]
*  You went to a bunch of Laker games. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4659.759999999999s)]
*  There were moments where he was like, all right, I guess I'll stand over here [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4661.24s)]
*  and Luca's going to do the, do the, uh, dribble the ball out and then shoot thing. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4664.12s)]
*  So I think it's a hard thing to get used to because it's like the Doug [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4670.0s)]
*  Collins quote where Doug Collins, I was like the hardest thing to coach is. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4673.44s)]
*  So a generational superstar star was when they're getting old, [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4677.16s)]
*  it's the hardest thing to coach. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4680.959999999999s)]
*  So, you know, I don't know. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4683.08s)]
*  I don't know what the right situation is for him. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4685.919999999999s)]
*  That's the weird thing. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4687.5599999999995s)]
*  Like he was playing basketball in the Cleveland gym the other day. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4689.04s)]
*  And yeah, I guess he does that every year. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4693.48s)]
*  It was a non story, but it was also like the timing of it was suspicious. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4695.12s)]
*  Cause he takes this Instagram. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4698.5599999999995s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4701.2s)]
*  I don't know how it plays out. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4702.08s)]
*  He's not getting bought out. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4704.32s)]
*  I'll tell you that much. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4705.24s)]
*  But I think the part it's like, can you not understand why somebody wouldn't [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4706.679999999999s)]
*  want to do like another $54 million option that you control for next year? [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4711.48s)]
*  At 42 years old, like, no, Hey, we can't keep maxing you off of that number [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4717.639999999999s)]
*  and then have you be in control of it. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4726.16s)]
*  So could you understand that at all? [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4727.959999999999s)]
*  And I don't, I don't think guys that are this special at stuff, they don't [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4730.959999999999s)]
*  agree with you. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4735.08s)]
*  Well, you made the key point with Bobby when you were saying, this is just [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4735.56s)]
*  something that LeBron chose to do it this way as an employee of a team to [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4740.76s)]
*  keep people in constant suspense, whether he's going to stay or go, because he [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4746.12s)]
*  felt like by never really fully committing long-term, it constantly put [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4749.84s)]
*  pressure on the front office to, we got to do this or he might leave. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4755.88s)]
*  This is go, this is a, this is a, this is a, this is a, [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4761.76s)]
*  this goes all the way back to the first Cleveland run when you first [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4764.88s)]
*  started like really paying attention. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4767.64s)]
*  And it felt like he and Rich Paul enjoyed. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4771.04s)]
*  Well, it wasn't Rich Paul initially. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4775.88s)]
*  It was, I mean, you're going, this is like, yeah, good one. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4777.240000000001s)]
*  But it, it played out after that, uh, even with Miami, but it was, it was like, [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4780.8s)]
*  they wanted you as ownership in the front office to always feel anxiety. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4788.0s)]
*  And I would argue that I think at some point that gets in the way of the [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4795.4400000000005s)]
*  partnership, because it would just lead to some resentment or maybe it didn't. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4800.08s)]
*  You know, I mean, you know, the guy made a million NBA finals. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4804.92s)]
*  So maybe the art, but I just, I was a little surprised that it was like 25, 26. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4808.2s)]
*  It was like, we're, we're going to do this like one more time. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4813.72s)]
*  Well, it was weird on the Lakers because they basically did [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4816.64s)]
*  everything he wanted for years. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4819.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4820.8s)]
*  They did the Davis trade. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4821.12s)]
*  They got rid of every young guy they had. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4822.6s)]
*  They mortgaged all of these picks and, and then year after year, they try to [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4825.320000000001s)]
*  pretend the Westbrook deal wasn't what they wanted. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4830.280000000001s)]
*  Um, you know, they drafted his son. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4832.72s)]
*  They brought in Reddick, you know, there's, there's maybe a move here or [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4834.96s)]
*  there that they didn't do, but for the most part, the coaches have changed a lot. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4838.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4842.68s)]
*  It's not like they've been fighting him in every turn. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4842.92s)]
*  Like those guys wanted Vogel out of there and they go, you know, but they, [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4846.64s)]
*  the reason the Vogel thing didn't work is because he was trying to figure out to [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4850.08s)]
*  make the Westbrook thing work and the Westbrook thing wasn't going to work a [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4853.2s)]
*  million different ways. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4856.64s)]
*  And then LeBron and that camp tried to distance themselves from Westbrook [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4858.08s)]
*  thing being like, yeah, we didn't want them either. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4861.8s)]
*  And you're like, that's not true. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4863.32s)]
*  Um, and then, you know, Darwin Ham comes in and they can't get rid of him quick [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4865.16s)]
*  enough, so I, I don't know, I just, I wonder if you could ever have like an [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4870.68s)]
*  honest moment with him and be like, you know, like people have kind of done what [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4876.56s)]
*  you've wanted to all the time. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4880.4400000000005s)]
*  Do you find things that you think they're doing wrong? [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4882.160000000001s)]
*  The only time I can remember is the summer of 2017 when he wanted the Cavs to [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4884.72s)]
*  trade everything, even though everybody knew he was going to go to LA in a year. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4889.200000000001s)]
*  And the Cavs are the one team. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4892.56s)]
*  They're like, fuck this. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4893.6s)]
*  We're not, we're not going to do that. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4894.320000000001s)]
*  Commit to an extension and we'll, we'll go for this. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4896.320000000001s)]
*  We'll go for Paul George, but. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4898.84s)]
*  It was like a lottery pick for like Deandre Jordan shot at that point. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4900.76s)]
*  And you were going like what? [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4906.08s)]
*  And then, I mean, even the Shabazz Napier thing, Miami ends up taking them. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4908.08s)]
*  I was thinking about the alternate universe. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4913.2s)]
*  So let's say he ops out. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4916.16s)]
*  I can't believe we're talking about LeBron. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4918.5599999999995s)]
*  The ESPN producers are making us do this. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4920.48s)]
*  Uh, he, he ops out. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4922.799999999999s)]
*  We can't make fun of them next time. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4924.92s)]
*  Cause we're doing, we just did. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4926.32s)]
*  Well, at least we're doing at the end of the podcast. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4927.36s)]
*  He ops out, right? [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4929.799999999999s)]
*  June 30th. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4931.44s)]
*  He's like, I'm out. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4932.24s)]
*  I'm done with the Los Angeles Lakers. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4933.44s)]
*  So it's 53 million, but you think like California taxes agent fee. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4936.32s)]
*  So maybe he's pocketing 24 million. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4942.5199999999995s)]
*  Right? [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4946.799999999999s)]
*  So he got, let's say he goes to Dallas. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4947.5199999999995s)]
*  What would Dallas be able to pay him? [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4951.16s)]
*  Like 8.8 for one year. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4952.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4955.0s)]
*  Was it the Angelo Russell deal? [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4955.2s)]
*  So it's like, yeah, so he gets 8.8, no state taxes in Dallas. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4957.08s)]
*  Maybe he pockets five. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4961.5199999999995s)]
*  So he's cost himself 20 million, but now he's on Dallas on this [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4963.44s)]
*  awesome team, potentially going for the fifth ring. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4969.64s)]
*  Could he have made the money back? [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4975.2s)]
*  Would that have been worth it? [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4977.04s)]
*  Like he's supposedly a billionaire. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4978.28s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4980.08s)]
*  It's a, would that have been, I wonder if he regrets like the [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4981.6s)]
*  way this played out going, Oh man, I actually should have opted out. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4984.44s)]
*  That would have been the baller move to be like, fuck it. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4988.32s)]
*  I'm going to bet on myself. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4990.32s)]
*  I'm going to go in. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4992.04s)]
*  I'm going to, I'm going to pick my team. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4992.76s)]
*  I'm going to make this a, or he goes to Golden State, right? [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4994.24s)]
*  Golden state has some cap space to send some free agents or there's [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=4997.08s)]
*  some sign and trade, whatever it is. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5000.08s)]
*  I wonder if he regret's not opting out. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5002.76s)]
*  Cause I think that would have been a smarter move, even though it was, you [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5005.68s)]
*  know, you can't tell somebody, well, passing up X amount of money, but I [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5008.12s)]
*  wonder if he would have been able to make it back. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5012.360000000001s)]
*  But what's making it back for him? [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5016.12s)]
*  You know, this is one of those things where the mistake is like, why [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5017.76s)]
*  wouldn't you just opt out of it? [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5020.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, after this past year and then the next year, 52 million, like I'm [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5021.52s)]
*  just looking at it real quick here again, that's going to put them at [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5025.92s)]
*  580 million in career earnings. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5028.56s)]
*  So just for NBA, not even that doesn't talk about all the off the court stuff. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5031.4400000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5036.080000000001s)]
*  So if you were pissed enough about what just went down because it was sort [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5036.4400000000005s)]
*  of a weird press release, yeah, yeah. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5043.72s)]
*  This is what we're doing. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5046.6s)]
*  It wasn't sort of a weird press release. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5047.320000000001s)]
*  It was weird. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5049.080000000001s)]
*  It was weird. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5050.0s)]
*  It was weird. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5050.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5051.24s)]
*  You're right. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5051.5199999999995s)]
*  We didn't even really know how to talk about it a week ago because I was like, [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5051.64s)]
*  we got to do something about this. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5054.5599999999995s)]
*  And we were kind of like, we didn't really know what it was, but we [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5056.08s)]
*  knew it was something. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5058.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5061.24s)]
*  So if, you know, that's the part where you're just not going to have any [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5061.5599999999995s)]
*  sympathy for him because I'm not, I wouldn't tell anybody, but like, yeah, [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5064.68s)]
*  you should have cost yourself 40 million and then you factor in the taxes. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5067.68s)]
*  Maybe it's 35 million, whatever. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5070.599999999999s)]
*  You should have done that if that was your main priority. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5072.28s)]
*  But now it's like, okay, well, you can't say anything. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5074.5599999999995s)]
*  Like you can't be upset about anything because you could have had all the [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5077.28s)]
*  freedom you wanted, you could, you could have gone anywhere you wanted. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5080.92s)]
*  And you weren't going to do that because you didn't want to sacrifice [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5085.04s)]
*  the massive contract number. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5088.52s)]
*  And so, you know, there you go. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5090.08s)]
*  Like it wasn't like they had the team option and they picked it up. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5091.56s)]
*  You decided to do this. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5094.56s)]
*  So Tom, Tom Brady went to Tampa. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5095.6s)]
*  And I don't, he wasn't full price, but it wasn't like what the situation [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5099.52s)]
*  LeBron would have been in where LeBron would have like taken a major [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5103.24s)]
*  discount to go to a contender. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5106.56s)]
*  But you could argue like, if you get that fifth ring, [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5108.64s)]
*  and you were a big part of a team, or if you went to Cleveland or wherever, [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5114.28s)]
*  um, maybe that would have been worth it. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5118.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5121.84s)]
*  Okay. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5122.5199999999995s)]
*  He like, at some point he's made so much money. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5122.8s)]
*  What is the difference to me? [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5125.64s)]
*  I have $1.7 billion versus $1.6 million, $780,000. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5127.0s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5133.72s)]
*  Cause whatever the situation is now, like, let's play it out. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5134.96s)]
*  There's going to be the Lakers. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5139.64s)]
*  Haven't said anything for a week. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5140.84s)]
*  We haven't heard anything from anybody. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5142.56s)]
*  We haven't heard the new owner, the old owner. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5144.56s)]
*  We haven't heard anything from JJ. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5146.4800000000005s)]
*  Polinka said nothing. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5147.84s)]
*  Nobody's even done like a passive aggressive fight back of like, dude, he opted in. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5149.68s)]
*  We expect him to be here in training camp. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5154.76s)]
*  We, he says he wants to be on the Lakers. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5156.56s)]
*  Well, he's on the Lakers and he's the one who asked for the no trade [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5159.04s)]
*  clause. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5162.12s)]
*  And he's the one like, we expect to see him on October 1st. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5162.48s)]
*  I don't know what the problem is. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5165.5199999999995s)]
*  He's Luka Donchich on his team. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5168.04s)]
*  We got the Andre Aiden. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5169.6s)]
*  Like we were the third three seed in the, in the West last year. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5171.48s)]
*  What's the problem? [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5175.0s)]
*  But nobody said that. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5177.5199999999995s)]
*  I just hope he understands he can't. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5184.72s)]
*  He's not going to be able to do that. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5188.92s)]
*  Hope he understands he can't send the eyes looking at something emoji before the [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5190.4s)]
*  trade deadline. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5197.12s)]
*  And my guess is that he's probably still going to do something cryptic later on. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5201.08s)]
*  And you're just like, Hey man, the rules are different now. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5207.24s)]
*  Like it's your, if you want a multi-year deal, I'm sure plenty of teams that do it, [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5209.4s)]
*  but it's not going to be at 50 million. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5215.599999999999s)]
*  What would be the most amazing? [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5218.16s)]
*  I I'm trying to think how this would be more fun from a content standpoint. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5220.16s)]
*  And wouldn't it be Luka being like, it's my team now. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5224.04s)]
*  He's got to learn how to fit in or like, you know, he's 17 years older than I am. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5228.32s)]
*  At some point you've got to recognize that it's a, it's a different generation of [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5236.72s)]
*  players moving in or just some sort of thing that would be like, Oh, [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5241.36s)]
*  selfishly, maybe LeBron for Jaylen Brown. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5245.76s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5250.12s)]
*  I would, I would, I would ask to come on twice that week with you. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5251.76s)]
*  You just make me do a 24 hour pod. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5255.8s)]
*  Well, that's the other thing. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5258.96s)]
*  Bobby made the point on your pod that I don't even know what is legal with the [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5259.68s)]
*  trade anymore. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5264.72s)]
*  These rules are so confusing. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5265.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, I was wondering like, is could you just trade Jimmy Butler for LeBron? [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5268.08s)]
*  Their salaries are almost exactly the same. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5272.04s)]
*  Apparently you can't. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5274.24s)]
*  No, Jimmy. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5276.32s)]
*  Well, Bobby, Bobby was just so good this week, man. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5278.88s)]
*  So I really appreciate you liking that pod because we got done and I went, God, [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5281.6s)]
*  you fucking killed it today. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5285.32s)]
*  And Bobby was joking that he wanted to have like pre-recorded sounders for us [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5287.24s)]
*  because we just pressed a button. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5291.8s)]
*  Like you and Zach, that triggers the second apron. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5294.12s)]
*  Zach might not need it. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5296.88s)]
*  Is there an AI Bobby? [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5298.8s)]
*  Could we do AI? [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5300.0s)]
*  That should be an app that he invents and you can just download all the sound [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5301.68s)]
*  bytes where he's just like, that would put you in the first apron. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5305.32s)]
*  But since it's aggregated, you know, he just, but then again, we'd have to know [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5308.400000000001s)]
*  that that was happening live as you were bullshitting about all these different [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5311.88s)]
*  things. But the best point, the one that you were going to make there is that [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5314.24s)]
*  poor Bobby gets aggregated by ESPN by saying there's no market for LeBron. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5317.56s)]
*  Then it goes on to explain why there's no market for LeBron. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5321.8s)]
*  Nobody can trade for him. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5325.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5326.4800000000005s)]
*  It looks really bad when you've got one of your most plugged in guys saying, but [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5326.88s)]
*  it's kind of back to the Cleveland thing that we were talking about last week. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5331.6s)]
*  And we should probably finish this topic at this point, because I don't know how [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5334.68s)]
*  much more I have left on it. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5337.32s)]
*  Is it as great as he continues to be this latest career? [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5338.360000000001s)]
*  I can't give up multi-year assets for a guy that I get. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5342.0s)]
*  I get when you're in your prime and you're not an awesome partner for a team, [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5347.12s)]
*  but I can't have you north of 40 fucking with me like you're 28. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5352.56s)]
*  Right. Hey, what do you want to do next year? [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5357.08s)]
*  What would you like to do? [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5359.92s)]
*  Do you want it? Okay. All right. You want to keep everything? [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5361.4800000000005s)]
*  All right. So that means if we're paying you this, we're paying Luca this, and we [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5364.4400000000005s)]
*  got to worry about the extension of Luca and then Austin, the whole thing. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5367.8s)]
*  Chances are we're not like they were lucky to be able to even get Aiden. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5370.76s)]
*  Okay. I don't even think that's necessarily like a bad team next year. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5375.04s)]
*  Well, you know what it is? [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5380.0s)]
*  It's a Bill Duffy team. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5382.0s)]
*  Solo agent changing the guard too. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5384.04s)]
*  The Duffy guys are coming into the Lakers clutch had their seven year run. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5387.16s)]
*  Now, now it's Bill Duffy's time. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5392.360000000001s)]
*  KCP and a one year 20 something. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5394.2s)]
*  The eighth thing happened after I did my pot on Wednesday. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5399.4800000000005s)]
*  You got to talk about on Thursday. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5401.8s)]
*  I just like, there's no more fascinating center you could throw on the Lakers [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5403.360000000001s)]
*  with LeBron and with Luca that where there's more scenarios at play. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5408.96s)]
*  I just, I thought he was, uh, really tough to take in Portland and the [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5412.8s)]
*  Phoenix people clearly had enough of them. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5417.96s)]
*  And we've, I've, I've followed the NBA enough with my life that usually. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5420.0s)]
*  Guys who show a certain set of behavior for season after season, it doesn't just [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5425.280000000001s)]
*  miraculously change when they're 27. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5430.320000000001s)]
*  With all that said, the guy puts up points and rebounds and they kind of, they [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5433.280000000001s)]
*  needed somebody who can just go 15 and 10 every game, you know, it's he, even [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5436.64s)]
*  having him not giving a shit in the Minnesota series last year still would [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5442.24s)]
*  have been better than what they had. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5445.44s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5447.36s)]
*  That's it. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5448.2s)]
*  That's if he, if he could actually give a shit for three of the seven games of a [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5448.679999999999s)]
*  series, it's still three more than whatever they had before. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5453.639999999999s)]
*  So I didn't mind it. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5456.4s)]
*  Uh, we'll see if LeBron can resurrect him. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5458.32s)]
*  He was able to resurrect JR Smith. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5460.679999999999s)]
*  There was, there was some, you know, distressed assets that he was able to [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5464.24s)]
*  pull stuff out of. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5469.16s)]
*  I don't know if it'll happen with eight, but it was certainly a better outcome [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5471.32s)]
*  than I think what we're looking at when you're looking at the free agent centers [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5475.4s)]
*  and they're like, uh, it's a total win. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5480.32s)]
*  And I'm going to give Lakers, uh, media. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5484.4s)]
*  I went looking for the pieces. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5487.48s)]
*  I went looking for the pro eight and new stop there. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5489.719999999999s)]
*  He's going to feed off of Luca. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5494.16s)]
*  He's going to feed off LeBron. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5495.639999999999s)]
*  JJ's always loved his, his skillset, the foundation of his skills. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5497.599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5502.44s)]
*  There's still a chance that it happens, but I went looking for it this week to [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5503.16s)]
*  hate read it and I was going to be so entertained by being like, you're just [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5507.0s)]
*  talking yourself and his credit to all the light. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5511.36s)]
*  I went through a lot of Laker stuff, locally sourced. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5514.16s)]
*  Blog media, good media group. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5517.88s)]
*  Really great work out of you guys. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5520.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5524.04s)]
*  Congrats. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5524.32s)]
*  Nobody's doing the thing. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5525.24s)]
*  I didn't read one delusional eight and thing, which I was disappointed by. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5526.48s)]
*  I was hoping to be entertained and it wasn't even out there. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5530.28s)]
*  So good job. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5533.12s)]
*  Nobody right now. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5534.5599999999995s)]
*  Once upon a time, a guy named Robert parish was traded to the Boston Celtics. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5535.36s)]
*  Much maligned for his work ethic, a lot like Deandre Aten. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5541.12s)]
*  And he became a hall of Famer. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5545.719999999999s)]
*  I like, there was some stuff floating around about how Deandre and Luca, cause [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5548.24s)]
*  they were in the same draft and Deandre had had some positive Luca comments. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5551.5599999999995s)]
*  Um, I actually think it's not an awesome offensive basketball fit for how he plays [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5556.84s)]
*  with, I think, um, just hypothetically, whatever, he's less of a lob guy and [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5562.16s)]
*  he's more of a spot guy. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5569.8s)]
*  Now, can you just say, Hey dude, have you looked in the mirror recently? [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5572.2s)]
*  Just, can you go catch some of these lobs from Luca? [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5575.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5579.44s)]
*  Can, can we show you a tape of a hundred lobs that you dunked over the course of [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5579.64s)]
*  your career? [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5583.48s)]
*  You and I were on, I think we, we had probably more patience for him than most [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5584.08s)]
*  because we really respected that finals run that he had and some of the stuff he [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5590.0s)]
*  did defensively. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5594.32s)]
*  It's in there, but those are the kinds of guys that break your hearts. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5595.24s)]
*  Cause you know, it's in there. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5599.04s)]
*  Because every time I read and look, the, the signings now are reading like press [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5601.0s)]
*  releases from the agencies. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5607.4400000000005s)]
*  And this has been going on for a long time. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5608.8s)]
*  And I understand why we do it or why we have it because the agent wants to get [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5610.4s)]
*  his name in there on the transaction. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5614.04s)]
*  And then when the agent is the one doing the favor to the insider. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5615.639999999999s)]
*  So I can't even really get mad at the insiders, but like, you'll go through [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5618.2s)]
*  and just want to read a story about a guy signing somewhere like, Hey, what could [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5621.4s)]
*  I not be thinking of something that I missed? [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5624.44s)]
*  You know, like I haven't, I've been watching every single eight in game his [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5626.28s)]
*  entire career, and then you run through the ones that come out and they're all, [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5629.48s)]
*  you could tell they're like written by the agency. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5633.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5636.28s)]
*  And by the time you're done with the eight and one, you're like, Holy shit. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5636.639999999999s)]
*  This guy's amazing. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5640.36s)]
*  How many is only 19 guys ever average 15 and 10 their first six seasons? [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5643.799999999999s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5648.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5648.48s)]
*  There's, there's some number that's like, he's the first guy or he's one of only [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5648.96s)]
*  like seven guys to start their career or 10 and 10, which, you know, is still a [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5653.2s)]
*  pretty impressive rebounding number. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5658.12s)]
*  It's not impressive scoring number, but there was about three or four lines. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5659.5599999999995s)]
*  And one of the stories that I read about him and you get done with like the last [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5663.12s)]
*  portion of it and you're thinking, I can't believe this guy was available. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5666.679999999999s)]
*  He's 26. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5670.36s)]
*  And you're like, what a date, like think about everything that you just read [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5671.719999999999s)]
*  and that Portland was still like, we're good. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5676.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5678.5199999999995s)]
*  Paragraph 12 is Portland paid him $25 million to go away at 26 years old. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5678.759999999999s)]
*  Then they have a defensive identity, but even Chauncey was like, please. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5687.4s)]
*  So yeah. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5693.599999999999s)]
*  Um, they got him. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5694.599999999999s)]
*  I really liked the Luray. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5695.679999999999s)]
*  I, as you know, like Luravia. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5697.4s)]
*  Um, I don't know if he would have been my number one target in free agency, but I, [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5699.719999999999s)]
*  I do like them. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5703.36s)]
*  I think he's going to play for them. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5704.12s)]
*  And, um, all the Laker fans who were telling us all summer, they were going to [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5706.16s)]
*  trade Reeves for a center and like, as always like, okay, here's a list of the [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5709.839999999999s)]
*  centers who you getting and, uh, unless you're going to try to trade them for [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5714.04s)]
*  Nick Quackston, which I don't, I wouldn't recommend the centers. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5718.12s)]
*  The centers, uh, don't really exist. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5722.8s)]
*  Anyway. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5725.5199999999995s)]
*  All right. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5726.08s)]
*  That's it for us. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5726.4s)]
*  Uh, you're so both of us are kind of cutting back this summer, but you will be [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5727.36s)]
*  on the Braveheart rewatchables at some point this summer, you promised. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5733.32s)]
*  Yeah, I promised. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5737.32s)]
*  I just don't know if that's a on location one where I'll be. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5738.32s)]
*  So we were already off to a rough start, unfortunately on some of the planning, [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5742.88s)]
*  but that's okay. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5748.4s)]
*  All, all good things. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5749.28s)]
*  Nothing to complain about. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5750.72s)]
*  Um, all right. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5752.48s)]
*  Was that Braveheart? [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5753.679999999999s)]
*  I'll be thrilled to do that. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5754.639999999999s)]
*  Cause I just had those three Scots on that are rowing from Peru to Sydney. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5755.88s)]
*  And one of the questions that I had prepped up was, do you guys watch [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5760.5199999999995s)]
*  Braveheart regularly during the tough days? [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5763.5199999999995s)]
*  Cause they're on like day 90 now. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5766.639999999999s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5768.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, maybe we do a Twitter poll. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5769.8s)]
*  Would you rather hear Rossello on a Braveheart rewatchables or Casablanca? [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5771.36s)]
*  Cause fantasy said, fantasy said he would waive his $53 million dollar, uh, player [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5776.44s)]
*  option and signed for the vet minimum. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5783.12s)]
*  If we did Casablanca, I'm going to be, I'm not doing this as like fake humble. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5785.36s)]
*  I want you three to do Casablanca and I don't want to be on it. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5789.879999999999s)]
*  I think you guys are so fucking good that I, I just don't think, I don't think [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5793.4s)]
*  it makes sense for me to come on and make my jokes and be a dick about some things [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5798.799999999999s)]
*  or, you know, I don't want to get in the way. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5803.92s)]
*  Maybe African queen. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5805.52s)]
*  You come on. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5806.68s)]
*  Yeah, I could do African queen. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5808.2s)]
*  I loved that movie when I was a kid. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5810.04s)]
*  I was like, this Bogart guys got something. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5812.4800000000005s)]
*  Bogart and Hepburn. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5814.4800000000005s)]
*  What a combo. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5816.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5818.24s)]
*  It's just that boat had its challenges. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDWyBoTKo7g&t=5819.0s)]
