# Will the Lakers and the Clippers Miss the Playoffs?  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [July 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc6W2EPxZ98)
*  The Lakers did not get better in any way.
*  They had the exact same team they had last year.
*  And LeBron is a year older,
*  and they have a brand new coach who's never coached before.
*  And then this Bronnie James thing
*  is gonna be a weird wrinkle of the season.
*  I don't think it's gonna be a positive.
*  And it's cool that he's gonna be able to play with his son,
*  but it's gonna be a major distraction this whole season.
*  It just is.
*  And the odds of this team really looking rocky in December
*  and being a panic trade candidate,
*  I would think they're one of my number ones.
*  How about this?
*  So LeBron, who we had to go through this charade
*  of he was gonna take way less to get it for age,
*  and I can't believe people reported on us
*  that story with this straight face,
*  ends up with he took a little less
*  to get them under the apron.
*  But thank God he did that,
*  because the first report was that it was 104 million.
*  It was gonna put them above the second apron
*  going into the season.
*  And you're thinking, there's no way.
*  There's no way the optics alone
*  that you wouldn't shave a few million off
*  to allow yourself. Especially with your son
*  who's making two million a year.
*  So he didn't do that.
*  Well, what he did do, and I've never seen this before,
*  and if anyone can explain this,
*  I would love to know what the explanation is.
*  No trade clause,
*  but there's a 15% trade kicker.
*  How does that make sense?
*  They can't trade them, but it's a 15% trade kicker
*  if they do trade them?
*  What?
*  What is that?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know either.
*  Can he waive the no trade clause?
*  I just raised my suspicion.
*  I just thought it was, I've never seen that before.
*  Are you saying, well,
*  the problem is-
*  It was like, yeah, if we, a wink, wink,
*  yeah, if we have to trade you in January,
*  then you'll get paid, you'll get that money back,
*  and then some.
*  I just don't understand it.
*  And then I was looking at, all right,
*  what's their panic trade in December?
*  It's like, they,
*  I don't even know what the panic trade is
*  because nobody wants D'Angelo Russell
*  at 18 million a year, right?
*  Nobody wants Gabe Vincent at 11.
*  You'd be like, oh, we'll package our contracts together
*  with a couple picks, and it's like,
*  I don't know if anyone wants that
*  because then they're stuck with the contracts,
*  and the only guy I can look at that made sense to me
*  was Levine, who, his stock cratered to the point
*  that Golden State was offered Levine for Chris Paul,
*  who they were gonna wave, and Wiggins,
*  and they were like, we're good, no thanks.
*  So Levine basically has anti-trade value now.
*  And I don't, other than him and Andrew Aitin,
*  who else would the Lakers even get?
*  Levine's contract and his injury history
*  tells you everything you need to know about the market.
*  So that makes sense that you're attaching something to that
*  for someone to take that on,
*  but with the amount of time left on that deal,
*  it's not even really like the salary dump.
*  It's like, now you have to deal with this thing.
*  So that's-
*  Three years, 150 left,
*  which makes it impossible to trade.
*  Right.
*  The other thing that you're hinting at here
*  is why is there a trade kicker?
*  I didn't see that part of it.
*  I saw the no trade part.
*  Because when it was happening, and I thought,
*  are they actually, because the initial report suggested
*  that they were gonna be just over like the second apron.
*  Just over.
*  And I was like, there's no way.
*  There's no way they can go into it,
*  and then it would be really weird
*  if LeBron becomes passive aggressive
*  about the lack of activity before the trade deadline.
*  And it's like, well, dude, we're stuck.
*  We're stuck on this one.
*  They haven't even started the season,
*  and guys have already been in trade rumors with them.
*  Right?
*  It was like, we're gonna get Klay Thompson.
*  It would have been a sign of trade with D'Angelo Russell.
*  Well, I wonder if LeBron knew about that one.
*  Now the season starts like, hey, D'Angelo,
*  good to see you again.
*  How was your summer?
*  It's like, oh yeah, I tried to trade you for the ninth time.
*  The report was, and Klay apparently had dinner down here
*  at the Bottle Inn with the Dallas contingency.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  Once I read the story, I was like,
*  oh, right down the street,
*  get takeout from there all the time.
*  And the report was that the Lakers are willing to go higher
*  than even what Dallas did, and that Klay was like,
*  look, I can see how I fit in with Dallas immediately,
*  even though I think there's some Dallas questions
*  about your perimeter defense
*  if you're closing with Klay, Kyrie, and Luca.
*  What do you think?
*  Yeah, I love, I love.
*  Because Klay can't guard anyone anymore.
*  That was what was so funny about the Lakers scenario.
*  It's like, oh good, another guy who doesn't play defense.
*  He'll fit right in,
*  as everybody's going by all these dudes.
*  I don't like what the Lakers have done at all.
*  And really the only,
*  the only- What else are we gonna do
*  after the AD and the LeBron extension?
*  I don't think they had a lot of choices.
*  Yeah, I don't think they did either.
*  Yeah, they're paying 100 plus million for two guys,
*  but basically they need Vanderbilt to be healthy,
*  and they need Connect to be good,
*  to at least be like a ninth man who can play and shoot.
*  And they kinda need Gabe Vincent
*  to be who he was two years ago.
*  So there's three big can this happen?
*  They're not inconceivable.
*  But other than that,
*  I don't think they're getting
*  that Davis durability season again, do you?
*  It's as durable as,
*  I mean, and we'll talk about Paul George
*  and the Sixers after the break,
*  but are they getting that Paul George
*  durability season again?
*  Not sure.
*  No, I mean, the better bet would be
*  that you're not gonna get the same level
*  of durability from him,
*  because it was basically unprecedented for him
*  at this stage of his career,
*  considering how much he's been hurt in the past,
*  but it was an awesome season.
*  I think you'll see more Reeves on the ball.
*  I think you'll see him initiating more stuff.
*  I think that's what Reddick is probably looking at,
*  is I think in the beginning,
*  Ham didn't quite understand Reeves.
*  Benching him would tip me off to that.
*  Well, how about in the playoffs,
*  the first playoffs a year ago,
*  when that was their best asset against Denver,
*  and then Ham just wouldn't get the ball
*  in the fourth quarter.
*  Remember how much trouble Denver had
*  matching up against Reeves,
*  that first playoffs series?
*  And then you're right,
*  last year, Ham didn't get him at all.
*  I get the criticisms of Ham,
*  because I didn't think he did a great job last year.
*  But to your original conspiracy bill point
*  of the LeBron part of it,
*  it's just not very,
*  because I think anything's on the table
*  when you're theorizing what could happen.
*  Could LeBron say,
*  all right, I played with my son on the same floor,
*  but we're not winning it.
*  But who's trading enough assets back
*  for a $50 million price tag on a player,
*  even if everybody wanted LeBron?
*  Yeah, so I don't.
*  And then the Quippers.
*  It's like, no, they're gonna be better
*  with Batum and Derrick Jones,
*  the Paul George minutes.
*  Now they're gonna emphasize defenses.
*  They're definitely not gonna be better, guys.
*  I have Quipper fans in my life who are like,
*  no, it's more of a team now.
*  It's like, just stop.
*  Paul George was really good last year.
*  To me, the Quippers,
*  I have them last out of all those teams.
*  Zubach, Batum, Kawhi, Derrick Jones, and Harden.
*  And then Man Powell, Chris Dunn, Coffee, Bomba.
*  That feels like a lottery team to me.
*  That's like one 20 game Kawhi injury,
*  and you're in the lottery.
*  The West is too good.
*  The fact they got both those guys all NBA level,
*  and then Kawhi's just not available
*  for them in the first round.
*  I think anything was possible for that team
*  if they were healthy in the West.
*  I really do.
*  Last year.
*  Yeah, that run was incredible.
*  I still think that win against Boston
*  was the single most impressive game
*  I'd seen from a team all season long.
*  I'd put that game up against every other game
*  that I watched this entire year,
*  where they kicked their ass,
*  and they were all locked in,
*  and I went, this is real.
*  Which is also why I could have understood,
*  despite some of the cost stuff that we're talking about,
*  and how much we've all been just referencing
*  the second apron here for weeks,
*  where if they just said, oh, we'll just run it back.
*  At least this gives us a chance
*  because of what we saw before,
*  even if the same thing with the Sixers,
*  and the Paul George part of it now,
*  like Anthony Davis, as you just mentioned,
*  some teams are just better health bets,
*  and the Clippers still would have been a bad health bet.
*  You're right, if they don't have Kawhi,
*  I think Harden will put up some huge numbers.
*  By the way, did you get any sense
*  on who they were bidding against on that Harden deal,
*  or was that just a, hey, this is your status in the league,
*  and since we've lost George-
*  That felt like a wink-wink from nine months ago.
*  Yeah, who was going over 30 on him?
*  But we said that last year with Kawhi and Dallas.
*  Sometimes, there were no other,
*  I'm not Kawhi, Kyrie.
*  There were no other Kyrie bidders last summer in Dallas.
*  Still had to pay it.
*  So I think it's just the way it goes.
*  The thing for me with the Clippers and the Lakers,
*  is I think it's more conceivable to me
*  that both teams missed the playoffs than make it,
*  which is a pretty crazy place to be,
*  when you think like six years ago,
*  when the Davis trade and Kawhi and Paul George
*  go to the Clippers, like, oh my God,
*  battle LA, here we go.
*  And now I look at it, and it's like,
*  maybe that would be a fun fandal bet.
*  Do you think both LA teams
*  could miss the playoffs this year,
*  meaning not be one of the A playoff teams?
*  I think it's these nuts.
*  I'm just going off of last year standings.
*  That would be OKC, Denver, Minnesota in,
*  Clippers out, Dallas in, Phoenix in, so that's five.
*  And then you're putting Sacramento.
*  Memphis basically taking somebody's spot.
*  Sacramento stays in the top 10.
*  Memphis takes somebody's spot.
*  And New Orleans.
*  Maybe Houston.
*  Houston could also be one of those,
*  we actually have too many guys who think they're hot shit,
*  and this has been kind of a weirdly unhappy season.
*  E-May's mad at everybody.
*  I could see that version of their season too.
*  But I do like E-May.
*  A lot of guys who aren't playing enough.
*  I like E-May in that spot, as opposed to a younger dude
*  who's never been a head coach before with a young team,
*  where he'll just be like,
*  I don't care about your rookie extension.
*  Like, here are the eight guys.
*  Yeah, well out of all those odds,
*  I think Memphis,
*  Memphis at 20 to one seems like the best option.
