# Bill Simmons’s Midseason NBA Power Poll | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [January 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs)
*  All right. It is the mid-season NBA Power Pole. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=0.0s)]
*  Can't believe we're here taping this at 1030 [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=3.12s)]
*  on a Thursday morning. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=5.72s)]
*  Hopefully there'll be no more trades. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=7.44s)]
*  We're going to go from 30 to one. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=8.96s)]
*  Worst team to best team. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=11.92s)]
*  First category is the dregs. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=14.48s)]
*  We have five teams that are absolutely terrible, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=16.32s)]
*  that have a minus nine net or worse, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=18.6s)]
*  which is kind of impossible. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=21.44s)]
*  It reminds me of the cocaine era in the eighties [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  when there were just like five, six, seven, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=25.32s)]
*  just horrible teams every single year. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=26.94s)]
*  Going in order, number 30 Detroit. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=29.5s)]
*  They're four and 37. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=31.56s)]
*  Number 29 Washington. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=33.78s)]
*  They're seven and 32. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=34.9s)]
*  Number 28 Charlotte, eight and 30. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=36.66s)]
*  Number 27 Portland, 11 and 29. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=39.54s)]
*  And that might be 11 and 59 in about 30 games. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=42.14s)]
*  And then last but not least, San Antonio. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  They are number 26 for me. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=47.66s)]
*  Seven and 33. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=49.3s)]
*  I want to talk about Detroit quickly. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=53.019999999999996s)]
*  Monty Williams, $80 million. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=55.18s)]
*  I think it's a main reason why Spalstra ended up [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=57.1s)]
*  getting 120 from Miami because he was like, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=59.94s)]
*  there gave that guy 80 million. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=62.300000000000004s)]
*  I'm at least like twice as good as that guy. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=64.06s)]
*  The Jade and Ivy year that kind of unfolded [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=68.22s)]
*  for the first six weeks of the season [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=71.98s)]
*  where he didn't have the ball nearly enough. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=73.74000000000001s)]
*  They were playing killing Hayes [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=75.84s)]
*  in a ball handling spot over him. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=77.42s)]
*  He was kind of staying in the side [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=79.06s)]
*  even though he can't really shoot. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=80.22s)]
*  Monty should have to give back like 20 million of the money [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=81.72s)]
*  just for how he treated Jade and Ivy [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=84.5s)]
*  for about six weeks there. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=86.18s)]
*  Now Ivy's getting going. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=87.5s)]
*  They have some pieces of like, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=89.10000000000001s)]
*  I got to say I've not crossed them off my league pass yet. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=90.30000000000001s)]
*  I still kind of enjoy watching them as A. Stewart came back. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=92.82000000000001s)]
*  The Marvin Bagley trade was hilarious to me. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=96.10000000000001s)]
*  This is one of my favorite NBA things [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=99.14000000000001s)]
*  when they give somebody a stupid contract over the summer. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=101.10000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it was like 13 million year. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=106.10000000000001s)]
*  Who are you competing against for Marvin Bagley? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=107.58000000000001s)]
*  And then six months later, they do a trade [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=109.66000000000001s)]
*  where they have to give second round picks [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=111.82000000000001s)]
*  to get rid of the Bagley thing. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  And then to the media, it's like, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=115.26s)]
*  well, you know, now we have $60 million in cap space. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=117.5s)]
*  For who? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=120.74000000000001s)]
*  You're the Pistons, you suck. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=121.58000000000001s)]
*  Nobody wants to play for you. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=122.7s)]
*  And you just had to attach second round picks [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=124.06s)]
*  for a stupid signing that you should have done [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=126.22s)]
*  in the first place. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=127.82000000000001s)]
*  How does everybody have a job there? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=128.86s)]
*  Like, what else do you need to do to get fired? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=131.56s)]
*  Not that I'm advocating for people to get fired, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=134.74s)]
*  but everyone in the Pistons should get fired. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=136.52s)]
*  They should have dealt Bogdanovich last year. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=138.9s)]
*  He is one of the best pieces now. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=141.46s)]
*  And this is going to be ring around the rosy. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=143.34s)]
*  There's only a couple of teams that need wings. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=146.01999999999998s)]
*  He's the perfect price range. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=146.94s)]
*  He's in the 20s now. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=148.26s)]
*  Bruce Brown's on Toronto. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=149.29999999999998s)]
*  There's guys out there. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=150.98s)]
*  And Philly, Philly's probably the biggest one [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=152.38s)]
*  that's going to be going after like a swing. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=155.57999999999998s)]
*  Somebody make him between 15 and 20, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  but Miami's in the mix. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=159.89999999999998s)]
*  Like they should deal Bogdanovich now [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=161.32s)]
*  before a couple of these guys go. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=163.06s)]
*  I don't know what they're doing. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=165.77999999999997s)]
*  If I was a Pistons fan, I would be out of my mind [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=167.38s)]
*  with how this season has gone [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=169.98s)]
*  because they're paying the most money to the coach [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=171.26s)]
*  who doesn't know what he's doing. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=173.5s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=174.5s)]
*  Next, oh, on number 27, Portland, quickly. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=175.86s)]
*  I'll buy your scoot stock if you're selling it, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=181.3s)]
*  but it does make you wonder, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=183.66s)]
*  should they have just traded the number three pick [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=185.68s)]
*  and got an impact guy and kept him and kept Grant [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=188.86s)]
*  and actually tried to be good [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=191.74s)]
*  because the West is so wide open? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=194.0s)]
*  So I went down that thought road [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=196.5s)]
*  and I just couldn't come up with what the trade was. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=198.06s)]
*  Like the number three pick for Ian and Obi, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=200.22s)]
*  I just don't think Toronto would have done it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=202.9s)]
*  I think they valued him. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=205.33999999999997s)]
*  Jalen Brown, Boston probably doesn't do it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=206.17999999999998s)]
*  Maybe Siakam. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=208.61999999999998s)]
*  The value of that number three pick [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=210.5s)]
*  was somewhere around those guys. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=211.82s)]
*  Did those guys make a difference? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=214.7s)]
*  I think they probably ended up in the right place. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=216.22s)]
*  We'll see with scoot, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=218.61999999999998s)]
*  but it just is an interesting sliding doors for them. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=220.11999999999998s)]
*  All right, next category is the year from hell. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=222.98s)]
*  That's obviously Memphis. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=224.66s)]
*  They are somehow 15 and 25, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=225.82s)]
*  even though every single thing has gone wrong for them. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=227.77999999999997s)]
*  They did stumble into this Gigi Jackson guy [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=229.77999999999997s)]
*  who I had never heard of obviously. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=232.17999999999998s)]
*  He was the second round pick. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=234.14000000000001s)]
*  Did some research on him though, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=235.42s)]
*  and he was the number one overall guy in the class of 2023. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=237.1s)]
*  And he was supposed to go to North Carolina [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=242.22s)]
*  and he reclassified and ended up in the class of 2022. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=243.9s)]
*  Goes to South Carolina for a year. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=247.4s)]
*  I guess the season didn't go that well [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=250.5s)]
*  because they ended up going 45th. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=252.22s)]
*  This seems to happen over and over again. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=254.62s)]
*  These pedigree guys, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=256.5s)]
*  Derek Lively is a little bit like this on the maps too. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=257.38s)]
*  These guys that are like clearly top five, top three, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=259.46s)]
*  maybe even top one in their high school class, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=262.82s)]
*  like ninth, 10th, 11th grade, maybe even in 12th grade. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=264.7s)]
*  Then something weird happens to them in college for a year [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=267.9s)]
*  they go to the wrong team or they get hurt. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=271.26s)]
*  And then all of a sudden they fall [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=272.82s)]
*  into like the thirties and forties. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=273.74s)]
*  Gigi Jackson, I'm watching this guy. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=275.82s)]
*  With that said, Memphis is very close [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=278.78s)]
*  to being on my league pass cross-off list, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=280.58s)]
*  which right now includes Washington, Brooklyn, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=282.76s)]
*  Memphis maybe, unless Gigi Jackson [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=287.08s)]
*  turns into Youngenmeyer, Stoudemire. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=289.26s)]
*  And I gotta say, I can't watch San Antonio. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=291.46s)]
*  I know they have Wemby. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=293.53999999999996s)]
*  I know he is an absolute unicorn. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=294.58s)]
*  I know he does stuff every game, but guess what? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=296.46s)]
*  That's what YouTube is for. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=299.58s)]
*  That's what Twitter is for. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=301.21999999999997s)]
*  That's what your friends texting you a video is for. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  I don't have to watch the Spurs games to get a Wemby fix. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=306.14s)]
*  That team is a disgrace. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=309.74s)]
*  I can't believe that's the team they're putting around Wemby. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=311.06s)]
*  Honestly, I can't believe it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=313.74s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=315.58s)]
*  You have like a once in a generation dude [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=316.41999999999996s)]
*  and the roster he has is the worst roster in the league. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=318.58s)]
*  And they don't even really have cap space, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=322.38s)]
*  which I don't understand. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=324.03999999999996s)]
*  Anyway, Wemby, if you ever do anything good, guess what? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=325.24s)]
*  I'll see you on social media. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=328.09999999999997s)]
*  I'm not watching the Spurs. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=329.21999999999997s)]
*  Next category, trade machine mercenaries. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=330.82s)]
*  Well, Toronto's already traded in an OB and Seahawking. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=334.0s)]
*  And they've turned those guys into Quickly [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=338.09999999999997s)]
*  and RJ Barrett and Bruce Brown [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=339.97999999999996s)]
*  and three first round picks, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=343.26s)]
*  including two in this upcoming draft [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=344.65999999999997s)]
*  that everybody seems to absolutely hate [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=346.38s)]
*  and is comparing to 2013 and 2000. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=348.38s)]
*  I still didn't mind the trade [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=352.21999999999997s)]
*  because Seahawking was gonna leave. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=353.53999999999996s)]
*  And an OB is doing really well in the Knicks, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=355.85999999999996s)]
*  but I like what they got back. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=358.58s)]
*  They had to change their identity. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=360.17999999999995s)]
*  They're 16 and 25 right now. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=361.26s)]
*  Can they flip Bruce Brown [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=363.46s)]
*  or will Bruce Brown be really fun in the Seahawking role? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=364.94s)]
*  I love Bruce Brown. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=368.05999999999995s)]
*  We'll get to him later. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=368.97999999999996s)]
*  Should they trade Pertle? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=370.34s)]
*  Brown's at 22 million, Pertle's at 19.5 million. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=371.41999999999996s)]
*  If they trade Brown, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=374.5s)]
*  I can't put anything else with it, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=375.34s)]
*  but they could do stuff like they could trade Brown [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=377.41999999999996s)]
*  to the Knicks for four days expiring [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=379.32s)]
*  and one first, two first, whatever. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=381.94s)]
*  They could trade him for Andrew Wiggins [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=384.17999999999995s)]
*  and some sort of pick swap. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=386.09999999999997s)]
*  I keep saying this, Andrew Wiggins is from Canada. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=388.26s)]
*  Or keep Bruce Brown or this is what pisses me off. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=391.06s)]
*  I know he's gonna end up in Philadelphia. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=395.7s)]
*  Can somebody else trade for him [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=397.34s)]
*  before he ends up in Philadelphia? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=398.46s)]
*  It's super easy for Philadelphia to get him. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=399.85999999999996s)]
*  They got Marcus Morris. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=401.38s)]
*  They can add one more contract. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=402.9s)]
*  Just take Bruce Brown back. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=405.34s)]
*  He's the perfect guy for the Sixers [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=407.7s)]
*  if they don't have to give up anything in their core. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=410.78s)]
*  Ultimate glue guy. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=414.02s)]
*  I loved what he did on Denver last year. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=414.94s)]
*  I hope and pray that Philly doesn't get Bruce Brown. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=416.79999999999995s)]
*  Next trade machine mercenaries, Brooklyn at number 23. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=421.26s)]
*  They're 16 and 24. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=424.84s)]
*  And then last but not least at late at 17 and 23. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=426.41999999999996s)]
*  I think the James Harden for Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=430.58s)]
*  a 23 first and a future 27 first, top eight protected [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=434.94s)]
*  is edging up the ladder of worst deals of the last 10 years. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=439.21999999999997s)]
*  Oof. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=443.58s)]
*  I look at their team. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=445.41999999999996s)]
*  They don't have their pick cause it's going to Houston. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=446.26s)]
*  Their keepers, Mikael Bridges, probably Cam Johnson. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=449.14s)]
*  And there's a little pricey. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=452.62s)]
*  Their trade assets are Finney Smith, O'Neal, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=453.53999999999996s)]
*  Claxton and Dinwiddie. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=455.82s)]
*  And there's a little hesitation like, what are we? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=457.9s)]
*  We don't have our pick. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=460.5s)]
*  You don't want to tank. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=461.46s)]
*  You know what? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=463.09999999999997s)]
*  The move is to be sellers. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=463.91999999999996s)]
*  You can't even, the pick's gone. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=464.76s)]
*  They already went through this with the Tatum pick [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=465.73999999999995s)]
*  and the Brown pick. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=467.41999999999996s)]
*  Just the draft sucks. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=468.79999999999995s)]
*  Just trade. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=470.41999999999996s)]
*  Trade Finney Smith. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=471.44s)]
*  He's at 13, 14 and 15. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=472.58s)]
*  Trade O'Neal. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=474.62s)]
*  Maybe trade Nick Claxton. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=475.65999999999997s)]
*  Maybe somebody wants Dinwiddie. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=477.34s)]
*  Get rid of all these dudes. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=479.26s)]
*  I think they should trade Claxton to OKC [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=480.41999999999996s)]
*  because OKC desperately needs a big guy. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=483.09999999999997s)]
*  Flip Finney Smith to Philly for a pick. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=486.26000000000005s)]
*  Send O'Neal out for a pick. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=488.86s)]
*  Just bottom out. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=490.26000000000005s)]
*  Your roster stinks and it's not fun to watch you guys. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=491.3s)]
*  So don't worry about that you don't have a pick. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=494.82000000000005s)]
*  And then Atlanta. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=497.1s)]
*  Who knows what's going to happen with Murray? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=498.62s)]
*  Everybody knows he's been available for a month. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=500.06s)]
*  I think it'd be hilarious if he went back to San Antonio, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=501.94000000000005s)]
*  which would be, I think the first ever return [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=504.34000000000003s)]
*  to sender trade we've had. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=506.1s)]
*  They gave, Atlanta gave up 25, 27 first, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=507.68s)]
*  26 pick swap and a future Charlotte first, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=511.06s)]
*  plus an expiring from Murray. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=514.38s)]
*  And they get 70% of that back. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=516.98s)]
*  If you're San Antonio, you're feeling good. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=518.62s)]
*  Set this guy away for a couple years, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=520.02s)]
*  got one bit down and now he's coming back. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=521.46s)]
*  I don't know where he ends up [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=523.46s)]
*  and I'm not positive how good he is [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=524.7s)]
*  because I haven't loved how he's looked at Atlanta [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=527.78s)]
*  and I don't know whether it's Trey Young's fault [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=530.14s)]
*  or it's the wrong team or what's going on. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=531.74s)]
*  But the guy who used to be a defensive study, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=533.38s)]
*  the eye test is not backing that up this year. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=536.74s)]
*  So I don't know what happens with him. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=539.58s)]
*  KOC was saying trade Trey Young to San Antonio for picks. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=542.5s)]
*  We still get me to watch San Antonio. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=546.18s)]
*  Next category is Yikes, Golden State. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=548.18s)]
*  Just had a terrible tragedy this week too. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=550.74s)]
*  They lost their assistant coach [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=552.58s)]
*  and it's just like, just one thing after another [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=554.34s)]
*  with that team. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=558.46s)]
*  I have no idea what they're gonna do at the trade deadline [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=559.3s)]
*  because Wiggins has almost given himself negative value. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=562.74s)]
*  We have to attach something just to get rid of him. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=567.7s)]
*  That's how dark it's gotten for Wiggins. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=569.98s)]
*  Kaminga, I talked about this on the podcast last week. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=573.02s)]
*  He made his own bed two weeks ago [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=576.02s)]
*  when he was complaining to the press when he's 21 years old. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=578.8199999999999s)]
*  He's the jack shit in his career. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=581.02s)]
*  You shouldn't be talking to the press. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=582.46s)]
*  Settle down Kaminga. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=583.54s)]
*  Clay's not an expiring and you're stuck [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=585.78s)]
*  because he's a statue guy and he's literally a statue [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=588.02s)]
*  if you watch him. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=591.8199999999999s)]
*  Like he just doesn't have the same mobility [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=592.66s)]
*  and I don't really know what the move is [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=595.54s)]
*  and they just actually feel done to me. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=596.9399999999999s)]
*  Like I don't think there's any coming back. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=599.5s)]
*  I don't think there's a scenario [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=601.5s)]
*  where they could crack the top four, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=603.62s)]
*  upset somebody in round one. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=606.34s)]
*  I just don't see it. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=607.78s)]
*  I think they don't see it. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=609.02s)]
*  Got me thinking. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=611.38s)]
*  What happens if Charlotte calls them [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=614.46s)]
*  and Godfather offers them for stuff? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=617.06s)]
*  And I know Golden State will say no. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=619.86s)]
*  I know he's one of the most untradable guys [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=621.38s)]
*  we've had this century, but let's talk it out. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=623.22s)]
*  What if they offered Lamello [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=627.42s)]
*  and they offered Hayward's expiring [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=629.54s)]
*  and they offered them foreign protected first [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=631.9399999999999s)]
*  for Steph Curry? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=634.54s)]
*  Now you'd say, why did Charlotte do that? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=635.6999999999999s)]
*  Well, Charlotte's been a disaster as a basketball franchise [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=637.18s)]
*  basically in any incarnation of it. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=640.9399999999999s)]
*  Steph Curry from Charlotte, they bring back the hero. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=644.5s)]
*  Now you have a building base. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=648.86s)]
*  He becomes, maybe you promise him down the road, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=650.54s)]
*  wink, wink, you'll get a piece of this team when you retire [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=653.26s)]
*  and you just make a Mr. Charlotte. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=655.66s)]
*  And then if you're Golden State, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=657.6999999999999s)]
*  you get a reboot with Lamello, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=658.5799999999999s)]
*  the guy should take it anyway in a bunch of firsts. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=659.98s)]
*  Maybe it's not four firsts, maybe it's three firsts. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=661.66s)]
*  I was trying to figure out it's a good who said no, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=664.26s)]
*  who would say no. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=667.3399999999999s)]
*  Also, what's the offer that would make Golden State [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=668.66s)]
*  at least take a meeting? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=671.78s)]
*  And I think it would be Lamello and four firsts. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=672.9399999999999s)]
*  They're not trading Steph. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=676.6999999999999s)]
*  So when this gets aggregated, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=678.62s)]
*  because this is the new world we live in [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=679.98s)]
*  where they just aggregate a piece of something you said [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=681.38s)]
*  and not the actual context of it, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=684.66s)]
*  I do not think the Warriors are going to trade Steph Curry. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=686.78s)]
*  My point is if Charlotte calls them [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=689.7s)]
*  and Godfather offers them for Steph Curry, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=692.1800000000001s)]
*  I think they have a meeting at least. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=695.34s)]
*  Where the hell are they going? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=697.1s)]
*  What are they gonna do with Steph Curry [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=698.34s)]
*  for the next five years of his career? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=699.58s)]
*  It really feels like this is a mess. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=701.3s)]
*  So anyway, that's how bad it's got for the Warriors [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=703.66s)]
*  of making up Steph Curry trades. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=705.66s)]
*  Next category, works in progress. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=707.66s)]
*  Houston is 19 and 21 and the arrows pointing down. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=709.1800000000001s)]
*  Chicago is 19 and 23 and the arrows pointing sideways. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=713.3s)]
*  They are still minus 2.6 net rating. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=718.06s)]
*  I have the Lakers at 18. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=721.74s)]
*  They are 20 and 21. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=723.9s)]
*  And those are the three. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=725.66s)]
*  I'm not positive where things are going with those teams. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=726.62s)]
*  The Lakers have the pedigree, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=729.54s)]
*  but to be 500 for half of the season [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=730.9399999999999s)]
*  when your two best guys have been healthy the entire time [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=736.3399999999999s)]
*  is not a good sign. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=738.62s)]
*  One thing that's funny with LeBron, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=740.62s)]
*  I know we've talked about how they've been [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=742.1s)]
*  in the 20s offensive rating five of the six years [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=745.9s)]
*  he's been in the Lakers. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=748.62s)]
*  And you hear people talk about, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=750.38s)]
*  oh, they gotta get shooting. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=751.94s)]
*  They gotta get this guy. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=752.98s)]
*  They gotta get that guy. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=753.82s)]
*  Well, there's a couple of things [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=754.74s)]
*  that nobody ever mentions with this. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=755.66s)]
*  They're paying two max guys a combo [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=758.94s)]
*  of like $100 million a year when there's a salary cap. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=762.22s)]
*  Really hard to have three guys. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=765.82s)]
*  Look at what Phoenix did. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=767.1800000000001s)]
*  Phoenix was able to cram the third max guy [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=768.14s)]
*  and now they're, you know, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=770.82s)]
*  God only knows what's gonna happen with that team, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=773.1s)]
*  especially anytime Beal gets hurt, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=774.62s)]
*  they just look like a mess. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=776.38s)]
*  So you're gonna have to hit on the fringes [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=779.98s)]
*  and you're gonna have some flawed guys. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=783.1400000000001s)]
*  You're not gonna end up with Kyrie Irving, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=785.1s)]
*  you're gonna end up with D'Angelo Russell. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=787.1s)]
*  That's the way it goes when you're paying [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=788.74s)]
*  two $50 million guys. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=790.0200000000001s)]
*  What's interesting is, especially the Laker fans I know, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=791.82s)]
*  is like they just gotta get some shooting around LeBron. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=795.34s)]
*  Well, they had shooting around LeBron. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=798.86s)]
*  Go look at the three point leaders. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=801.02s)]
*  Beasley, he's 48% from three this year. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=802.74s)]
*  He's second in the league. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=805.1800000000001s)]
*  He's making three a game for the Bucs. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=806.1s)]
*  He was wasting away on their bench last year. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=807.94s)]
*  They had Caruso, they won a title with him. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=810.42s)]
*  He's at 41.5%. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=812.26s)]
*  They let him go. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=814.1s)]
*  KCP, they traded him for fucking Russell Westbrook. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=815.42s)]
*  He's at 40.7% three this year, 1.5 a game. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=818.78s)]
*  They had Malik Monk. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=822.58s)]
*  He's one of the best six men in the league. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=824.38s)]
*  They had him on the team and had an unhappy season with him. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=825.94s)]
*  And then he went to Sacramento and was immediately good. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=830.2600000000001s)]
*  Even right now, Russell, 40.7%. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=834.1800000000001s)]
*  Prince is at 38.5%. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=836.7s)]
*  Maybe we're not asking the right questions. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=840.1s)]
*  If these shooters are going on to thrive outside of LA, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=843.0600000000001s)]
*  why is that? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=846.3800000000001s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=847.22s)]
*  Is it hard to play in the fishbowl of the Lakers? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=849.1800000000001s)]
*  Is it hard to play where AD and LeBron, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=853.2600000000001s)]
*  it's their team and everybody else, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=855.38s)]
*  are these interchangeable dudes that end up in trade rumors [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=856.86s)]
*  the moment anything's going wrong? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=859.42s)]
*  Look at Austin Reeves. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=860.46s)]
*  He just signed this big, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=861.74s)]
*  I think they gave him 56 million for four years. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=863.38s)]
*  And the moment things go wrong, it's his fault. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=866.22s)]
*  He's in every trade. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=867.9s)]
*  And needs to say, he's not playing well. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=869.38s)]
*  So I do wonder, and I don't think this is LeBron's fault, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=871.82s)]
*  but it's the fishbowl that he brings. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=875.3s)]
*  Some guys don't play that well in it. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=877.62s)]
*  And then you're always looking at glass half empty [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=879.62s)]
*  instead of glass half full. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=882.46s)]
*  And in this case, this team had good shooters. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=884.9000000000001s)]
*  Malik Beasley's been an awesome offensive player this year. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=887.7800000000001s)]
*  He didn't play last year. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=890.6600000000001s)]
*  So what are they doing wrong? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=892.34s)]
*  I think is a more interesting question [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=894.62s)]
*  than what do they need. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=896.1400000000001s)]
*  All right, next category is the super fun crew. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=897.2600000000001s)]
*  I got 17 Orlando. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=899.9000000000001s)]
*  They're down to 22 and 19. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=901.82s)]
*  No Frans. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=904.4200000000001s)]
*  I'm not worried yet, but no Frans. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=906.1400000000001s)]
*  You realize how Palo and Frans dependant they are. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=911.54s)]
*  Suggs has been my personal role guy MVP [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=914.18s)]
*  until Bruce Brown ends up on an awesome team. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=917.8199999999999s)]
*  But it'll be interesting to see if they decide, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=920.42s)]
*  we're actually a little closer than people think. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=923.9399999999999s)]
*  We're gonna go make a move [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=925.6999999999999s)]
*  or just kind of play it cool for one more year. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=926.9399999999999s)]
*  They do have some expirings and some stuff to trade. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=929.54s)]
*  I have no idea what they're gonna do. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=932.9s)]
*  We'll see when Frans comes back. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=934.86s)]
*  But to me, this is probably a play-in team, unfortunately. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=936.02s)]
*  Number 16, Utah. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=938.9399999999999s)]
*  Will Hardy. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=942.02s)]
*  He's gotta be the coach of the year. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=943.38s)]
*  That team was like a giant buffet table of food. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=945.54s)]
*  And it was like a brunch buffet table. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=949.02s)]
*  So there's like some lunch on there and some breakfast. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=950.98s)]
*  And there's some fruit, but there's also oysters. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=953.38s)]
*  And you're like, what the hell is this team? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=955.6999999999999s)]
*  Am I supposed to put all this stuff on my plate? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=958.6999999999999s)]
*  And none of it made sense. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=961.26s)]
*  And then somehow he made sense with it. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=962.42s)]
*  He now has Kessler on the bench, right? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=964.1s)]
*  That doesn't make sense. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=967.9s)]
*  Kessler is a really good young center. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=968.78s)]
*  But for them, it makes sense. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=970.1s)]
*  They play Sexton and Chris Dunne together. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=971.74s)]
*  I didn't even know Chris Dunne was alive. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=973.5s)]
*  And Chris Dunne has been rejuvenated. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=975.5400000000001s)]
*  But they moved everything around. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=977.1s)]
*  I never thought they were gonna trade marketing. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=978.86s)]
*  But all the lineup kind of rotation stuff they've done, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=981.62s)]
*  the Celtics killed them. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=984.74s)]
*  I have, unfortunately, every time I watch Utah, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=985.9s)]
*  they play terribly or they underachieve. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=988.66s)]
*  So I need to catch them on a good game. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=990.9s)]
*  But I'll tell you this with Danny. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=993.1800000000001s)]
*  I saw this with the Celtics. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=996.98s)]
*  He'll zag when you think he's gonna zig. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=998.94s)]
*  And he'll zig when you think he's gonna zag. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1000.82s)]
*  People were thinking like he was gonna trade for more pick. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1002.86s)]
*  I actually think he'll use some of these picks [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1005.0200000000001s)]
*  and maybe try to get something, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1007.7s)]
*  maybe use the Collins contract [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1009.98s)]
*  and attach a couple of picks to it [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1013.0600000000001s)]
*  and try to get an impact guy. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1014.5400000000001s)]
*  Would not surprise me. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1016.5s)]
*  I see you, Danny Hage. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1017.86s)]
*  Number 15 is Indiana. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1019.1400000000001s)]
*  They're 23 and 17 and just made the big trade. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1021.34s)]
*  Pascal Siakam. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1025.06s)]
*  They traded Bruce Brown, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1026.74s)]
*  who I thought played pretty well for them [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1027.74s)]
*  and three first round picks. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1029.98s)]
*  Two were this year. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1031.3s)]
*  Neither of them is gonna be an impactful pick. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1032.9s)]
*  The 26 unprotected might be. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1036.34s)]
*  The question is like, why do you do this? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1039.66s)]
*  Why not just sign them in free agency? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1041.42s)]
*  Well, the new NBA, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1044.66s)]
*  you can only have two max contracts per team basically. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1047.06s)]
*  So they're saying, we have Hal Burton, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1050.26s)]
*  who's one of the best guards in the league. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1053.5s)]
*  We have a really fun team to watch. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1054.9s)]
*  We can upgrade from Bruce Brown to Siakam. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1056.74s)]
*  And who else is gonna pay Siakam 50 million a year? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1059.66s)]
*  I think what's changed is in the old days, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1064.1s)]
*  it's like, all right, big threes, big threes, big threes, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1066.34s)]
*  big cities, the biggest teams getting the best guys. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1069.1s)]
*  And now it's like, there's 60 max contract spots basically. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1072.78s)]
*  Every team has two of them, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1076.98s)]
*  including some of these teams [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1078.6200000000001s)]
*  that you wouldn't really pinpoint [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1079.98s)]
*  as being destination places. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1081.6200000000001s)]
*  So Indiana is like, yeah, we'll trade for Siakam [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1083.14s)]
*  and we're gonna be able to resign him [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1086.8999999999999s)]
*  because where the hell else is he gonna go? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1087.74s)]
*  Listen, he's a 23 and seven and five guy [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1090.58s)]
*  for the last five years. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1092.98s)]
*  He's durable. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1094.58s)]
*  He plays 36 minutes a game. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1095.4199999999998s)]
*  I had him, we did the ringer 100. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1098.1399999999999s)]
*  I think I had him 60th, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1099.6599999999999s)]
*  just because I think I was holding against him. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1101.3s)]
*  If he's the best bar in Toronto [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1104.02s)]
*  and there are nine games under 500, that's his fault. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1105.62s)]
*  And that's the thing with Siakam, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1108.6999999999998s)]
*  if he's your best guy, you're gonna go 16 and 25. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1109.9399999999998s)]
*  But if he's your second best guy [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1112.3s)]
*  and he's playing with Halliburton, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1114.26s)]
*  I like that for him. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1116.7s)]
*  When was the last time we saw him [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1117.66s)]
*  with like a real point guard, like a slashing kick? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1118.78s)]
*  It's like Kyle Lowry 30 pounds ago. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1120.94s)]
*  So I like the trade for Indiana [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1123.5s)]
*  a little more than some people. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1125.22s)]
*  Like I saw Haral Baba on Twitter, wasn't a fan. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1127.22s)]
*  I don't really care about the picks. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1130.7s)]
*  The 26, maybe I care a little bit. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1133.14s)]
*  I don't care about the picks this year. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1134.78s)]
*  And Bruce Brown was, he had a player option [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1136.22s)]
*  and could get out of there anyway. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1138.58s)]
*  So I like the thought of, we care about Halliburton. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1139.58s)]
*  We care about what we're building here. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1143.46s)]
*  Let's go get a real guy. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1144.8600000000001s)]
*  So they did. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1146.1000000000001s)]
*  I like to trade more for Toronto though, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1148.02s)]
*  just for the record. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1149.46s)]
*  Number 14, Sacramento, they're 23 and 17 [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1150.7s)]
*  and they're oozing some sort of panic trade vibe. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1153.46s)]
*  They're one of those teams [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1157.98s)]
*  that they can have an awesome game against somebody, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1160.02s)]
*  but you feel like they're gonna lose [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1162.7s)]
*  in the last two minutes. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1164.18s)]
*  Like the Phoenix comeback the other day [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1165.1000000000001s)]
*  was perfect example. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1167.38s)]
*  They're also like, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1168.66s)]
*  Kevin Herter, you're making 16 million a year. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1170.58s)]
*  Like are you good or you're not good? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1175.58s)]
*  You're an eighth man or you're like a fourth man? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1178.22s)]
*  What are you? [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1180.02s)]
*  Harrison Barnes, why are you making 17, 18, 19 [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1181.06s)]
*  for the next three years? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1184.1s)]
*  Are you like a ninth man? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1185.1799999999998s)]
*  Davion Mitchell, we spent a top 10 pick on you. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1187.78s)]
*  Are you playable? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1191.34s)]
*  It just feels like a trade [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1193.74s)]
*  where maybe they get one more big guy. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1196.58s)]
*  Maybe they go get, like they find Alex Russo, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1199.3400000000001s)]
*  but that's a wait and see team for me. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1202.14s)]
*  I wanna see what their trade is, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1204.9s)]
*  but when I say panic trade, dumb trade, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1206.1000000000001s)]
*  sometimes the worst trades are made by the teams [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1209.3400000000001s)]
*  that feel like they're a little closer than they are. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1211.66s)]
*  And to me, even if they added one more really good guy [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1215.1000000000001s)]
*  to this team, I still would not put them [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1218.06s)]
*  in the top four in the West. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1219.5800000000002s)]
*  So I would be careful Sacramento. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1220.6200000000001s)]
*  Number 13 is Phoenix. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1222.7s)]
*  They're finally starting to look relatively Phoenixy. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1224.8999999999999s)]
*  I don't understand KD's clutch stuff at all. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1229.78s)]
*  Like his clutch numbers are abominable, 36%, 27% from three. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1232.06s)]
*  And it's been one of the reasons their record isn't better. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1237.2199999999998s)]
*  And I don't know whether that he's just hitting [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1239.58s)]
*  a different point in his career [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1241.3s)]
*  or maybe the team around him not awesome. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1243.06s)]
*  What's crazy is they're getting this insane grace [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1245.4199999999998s)]
*  in Allen year and they've gotten pretty fairly healthy [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1247.54s)]
*  nirkage, like certainly more healthy [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1251.26s)]
*  than I thought he was gonna be. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1253.3s)]
*  And they're still 22 and 18. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1254.26s)]
*  So I think for them, I wanna see what happens [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1255.62s)]
*  in the next three weeks. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1258.78s)]
*  You could tell me there can be 30 and 19 in nine games [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1259.62s)]
*  and I'd believe it. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1261.98s)]
*  You could tell me they could be 26 and 26 and 11 games [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1263.02s)]
*  and I'll believe it. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1267.66s)]
*  We will see. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1268.48s)]
*  I have no real interesting thoughts on Phoenix [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1269.32s)]
*  other than we will see. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1271.7s)]
*  Next one, next category, maybe one move away. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1273.66s)]
*  The New York Knicks, they are now 24 and 17. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1276.9s)]
*  I love the Ananoby trade for them. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1278.9s)]
*  And it was one of those, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1280.54s)]
*  I thought they won the trade when they made it [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1282.3s)]
*  just because they got the best guy in it. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1283.98s)]
*  But when you watched it for like two games, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1286.7s)]
*  you're like, oh my God, they totally won this trade. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1288.58s)]
*  And what's cool about him, first of all, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1291.06s)]
*  you're putting him with this crowd [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1293.54s)]
*  that's really gonna appreciate what he brings to the table. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1295.54s)]
*  So you're getting the best possible version of him. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1298.26s)]
*  He's gonna be like, not only playing for a new contract, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1300.7s)]
*  which they probably agreed to already, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1303.1s)]
*  but he's showing off for the new fans. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1304.42s)]
*  The flexibility he gives them, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1307.98s)]
*  like let's say they play Philly in round one. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1309.46s)]
*  Let's say it's like the three, six matchup. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1312.1s)]
*  And then they'll play Philly versus Knicks. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1314.6799999999998s)]
*  Ananoby is the kind of guy you wanna put on Embiid. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1316.76s)]
*  People always think you guard Embiid with centers. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1319.56s)]
*  You wanna put somebody smaller on him who's strong, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1321.6s)]
*  who can get up in his chest. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1324.08s)]
*  Like the way Denver was playing him the other night [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1325.32s)]
*  was kind of stupid. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1327.6399999999999s)]
*  It didn't make sense to me. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1328.9599999999998s)]
*  The Celtics will throw a Drew Holiday on him. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1330.6799999999998s)]
*  They'll throw Jalen Brown at him. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1333.1599999999999s)]
*  They'll throw Tatum at him. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1334.32s)]
*  And then they'll throw Horford at him [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1336.1999999999998s)]
*  and they'll give him different looks. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1337.56s)]
*  Ananoby is somebody that could guard [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1339.56s)]
*  literally everybody in the Sixers. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1341.24s)]
*  They'll probably do one run at one cost and same thing. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1344.12s)]
*  So that trade was just a home run for them, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1345.84s)]
*  a really good one. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1348.12s)]
*  And they still feel like one move away. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1349.34s)]
*  I'll be interested to see if they can attach Randall [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1351.3799999999999s)]
*  and picks to anything would be kind of [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1354.36s)]
*  the home run swing for them. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1355.9199999999998s)]
*  Number 11 is Cleveland. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1358.04s)]
*  For me they're 24 and 15. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1360.36s)]
*  They've won five straight and then you look a little closer [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1363.4199999999998s)]
*  and it's like, oh, they beat Washington. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1365.9599999999998s)]
*  Washington, San Antonio, Brooklyn, and Chicago. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1367.1s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1369.6399999999999s)]
*  They're one and five against the sells bucks [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1370.6799999999998s)]
*  and okay, see in Denver, not great, but they've also, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1372.76s)]
*  they're nine and three without Moby and without Garland. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1376.4s)]
*  And it is interesting that Garland goes out [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1379.04s)]
*  and it solves some of the Mitchell Garland stuff [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1382.18s)]
*  that I think we've all seen last season and this season. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1384.12s)]
*  And just keeping an eye on that team. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1387.08s)]
*  Cause it's clear they have redundancies [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1391.36s)]
*  and maybe one too many guys [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1394.92s)]
*  and they just feel two for one ish to me [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1396.8799999999999s)]
*  from a trade standpoint. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1399.16s)]
*  24 and 15 though, I would not, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1400.36s)]
*  that's one of those where you look at the standings [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1402.32s)]
*  and you're like, wait, what? [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1403.72s)]
*  Cleveland's 24 and 15. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1404.92s)]
*  I certainly don't feel like they're a threat. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1406.16s)]
*  New Orleans is, they have 25 wins. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1408.24s)]
*  They're number 10 on my list. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1411.6s)]
*  Their net rating is up to plus 4.7. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1413.88s)]
*  And there are certain games, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1417.78s)]
*  if you catch them on the right night, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1418.8s)]
*  where they just have too much size [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1420.2s)]
*  and they just seem really big and overpowering. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1421.48s)]
*  And you're like, holy shit, New Orleans. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1423.96s)]
*  And then you can catch them two days later [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1425.64s)]
*  and they lose by 20 and they look completely discombobulated. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1428.1200000000001s)]
*  This team's a work in progress. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1433.04s)]
*  All of us gonna hinge on Zion. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1434.48s)]
*  And where is he in April? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1436.8s)]
*  Is he healthy? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1438.6s)]
*  Is he relatively in shape? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1440.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1444.24s)]
*  I don't even know what the trade is for them. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1445.08s)]
*  We did this last time. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1446.14s)]
*  It's like, what do they need? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1447.06s)]
*  They have talent at every position. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1448.0s)]
*  I don't know what the move is. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1450.08s)]
*  It should probably be a three for one for somebody, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1451.52s)]
*  but I don't know who the one is. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1453.48s)]
*  And it's not like they're gonna win the title this year. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1455.16s)]
*  So I'd probably not do anything with that team. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1456.8s)]
*  Dallas is the one, they're 24 and 17. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1459.06s)]
*  They got half of a completely normal Kyrie season. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1462.4s)]
*  Shout out to Kyrie. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1466.04s)]
*  We all like watching him play basketball [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1467.68s)]
*  and we had no drama from you for three months. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1469.52s)]
*  I loved it. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1471.84s)]
*  They need to make a trade. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1473.84s)]
*  I was wondering if this is a Bruce Brown team, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1475.48s)]
*  maybe somebody bigger, but one guy short. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1477.56s)]
*  I don't know if the Grant Williams thing [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1480.0s)]
*  has worked out for them. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1481.56s)]
*  I wonder if that's somebody they would move on [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1482.52s)]
*  before the deadline. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1485.24s)]
*  Sometimes he won't even play that many minutes, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1487.72s)]
*  but this is a team you would not want to see [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1489.8s)]
*  in a playoff series. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1493.2s)]
*  And it's also a team that could get swept [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1494.8799999999999s)]
*  four-oh in a playoff series. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1496.36s)]
*  But I think from a Kyrie standpoint, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1497.9199999999998s)]
*  I did not like the signing, did not agree with it. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1501.04s)]
*  And at least so far it's been okay. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1504.08s)]
*  With that said, next week he could give some interview [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1505.84s)]
*  and it could completely fall apart. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1508.24s)]
*  But there, I wouldn't call them a contender, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1509.84s)]
*  but they're on the fringe and they're at least a, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1514.96s)]
*  I'm not crazy about seeing Luca and Kyrie [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1518.08s)]
*  in a playoff series team. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1519.8799999999999s)]
*  So that's a victory. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1520.92s)]
*  And they also proved to us that tanking still works [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1522.36s)]
*  because they ended up with Derek Lively. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1525.0s)]
*  They made us all mad last April, including me. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1526.36s)]
*  And it ended up with that Derek Lively pick. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1528.8s)]
*  So there you go. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1532.2s)]
*  Next category, the veterans, Milwaukee. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1534.0s)]
*  Look, they can't guard anybody. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1537.32s)]
*  And you look at their defensive rating, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1538.8799999999999s)]
*  which is 19th right now. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1541.72s)]
*  That is a recipe for disaster in the playoffs. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1542.92s)]
*  And you could go through any season. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1545.24s)]
*  Find me a team that was 19th in defensive rating [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1547.12s)]
*  that won three straight rounds, much less four. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1549.56s)]
*  Giannis is plus 14 and a half on off. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1552.52s)]
*  I just want to mention that. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1555.4399999999998s)]
*  You felt that last night they got killed. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1556.3999999999999s)]
*  It feels like he has a bigger burden [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1558.84s)]
*  than ever before with this team. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1560.84s)]
*  Cause Dame, Dame stats are good, but he has nights [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1562.36s)]
*  where he just doesn't have it. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1565.3999999999999s)]
*  And Giannis night after night, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1566.52s)]
*  who really feels like he's got an extra FU to him this year. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1568.08s)]
*  I don't know what it stems from, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1571.8799999999999s)]
*  but I just can't take them seriously with the defense. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1573.44s)]
*  So we'll see if they can fix it. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1578.0800000000002s)]
*  Middleton looks better. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1579.88s)]
*  They got more to Beasley [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1581.1200000000001s)]
*  than I think they could have ever expected. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1582.3600000000001s)]
*  Crowder came back, but I'm just dubious. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1584.64s)]
*  Yeah, I know they beat the Celtics last week. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1589.0s)]
*  I get it. I get it. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1591.1200000000001s)]
*  They came out, Celtics were coming off [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1592.3600000000001s)]
*  an OT game against Minnesota. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1594.3200000000002s)]
*  Milwaukee shot the lights out. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1596.4s)]
*  The Celtics packed it at halftime. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1597.76s)]
*  I'm not going to overreact to that one if that's okay. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1600.0s)]
*  Number seven, Miami, which is too high. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1602.64s)]
*  But as you know, I'm terrified of Miami at all times. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1605.16s)]
*  And actually you could really pick apart Miami. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1607.3600000000001s)]
*  Miami is 24 and 17. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1609.88s)]
*  They're nine and oh in their crappy division. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1612.44s)]
*  They're in like the worst division of all time. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1614.24s)]
*  So if they, what, not for their division, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1615.76s)]
*  they are 15 and 17. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1618.64s)]
*  Not great. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1621.5200000000002s)]
*  Hakez, so he's been playing like 34 minutes a game [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1623.92s)]
*  for 10 weeks, basically. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1628.76s)]
*  And let's say he finishes at 32 minutes a game [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1631.04s)]
*  for the season. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1634.28s)]
*  He's hurt right now, but when he comes back, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1635.1200000000001s)]
*  he's shooting over 60% true shooting as a rookie. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1637.36s)]
*  So I went on a basketball reference and I was like, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1641.08s)]
*  how many guys have done this? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1643.72s)]
*  How many guys have played 32 minutes a game and shot [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1645.52s)]
*  60% true shooting as a rookie? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1647.6s)]
*  And it was four guys. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1650.32s)]
*  Adrian Dantley, Hall of Famer, Bill Cartwright, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1652.0s)]
*  multiple time champion and a top three pick in the draft. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1656.6799999999998s)]
*  Buck Williams, who was awesome. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1661.6399999999999s)]
*  I can't remember if he's in the Hall of Famer or not, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1663.8799999999999s)]
*  but he was one of the best power forwards of the eighties. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1665.52s)]
*  And Magic Johnson. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1668.1999999999998s)]
*  Those are the four guys ever who have done that. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1670.0s)]
*  This Hakez thing kills me. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1671.7199999999998s)]
*  I love watching him. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1673.04s)]
*  I can't believe he's on Miami. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1673.9599999999998s)]
*  It makes me so mad. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1674.9599999999998s)]
*  If you wanted to drop that to 30 minutes a game, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1676.0s)]
*  you could add Jalen Williams and Deandre Aitin to that. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1678.24s)]
*  But that's how good Hakez has been. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1681.28s)]
*  And if you watch Miami, they're, they, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1683.1599999999999s)]
*  they're just getting more and more comfortable [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1684.8s)]
*  running the offense through him. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1686.32s)]
*  The problem for them is Kyle Lowry, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1687.76s)]
*  who in his last 10 games, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1689.9199999999998s)]
*  he's down to 5.4 points a game in his last 10 games. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1691.4399999999998s)]
*  She'd 41%, 28% from three. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1694.28s)]
*  He's playing 24 minutes a game for them. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1697.52s)]
*  And just looks like he's run out of gas. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1699.1599999999999s)]
*  I know he hurt his hand, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1701.32s)]
*  but expiring contract just feels like a trade. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1702.8799999999999s)]
*  There's been some Roger buzz with them. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1706.32s)]
*  It makes a ton of sense. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1708.8799999999999s)]
*  Roger seems, is just a classic, classic, classic Miami guy. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1710.12s)]
*  Plus he's been in some, some big playoff games. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1714.44s)]
*  He's playing well this year. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1717.3600000000001s)]
*  Maybe it's something like Lowry and Nikola Jovovich [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1719.6000000000001s)]
*  for the 27 unprotected first and Roger and book night. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1722.8400000000001s)]
*  Maybe they tried to get Nick Richards too, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1727.6000000000001s)]
*  which I would encourage them to do [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1729.3200000000002s)]
*  cause I like Nick Richards, but maybe you add it. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1731.0s)]
*  Maybe now it's like a protected second first, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1733.3200000000002s)]
*  but feels like there's a Charlotte Miami trade there. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1735.52s)]
*  And if they can turn Lowry into Roger somehow, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1738.6000000000001s)]
*  that's to me, that's the move. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1742.0s)]
*  Their assets, they have their first this year. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1744.96s)]
*  They are one of two first next two years. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1747.0s)]
*  Then they own their own first for the next four. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1749.8s)]
*  So they're doing something. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1751.84s)]
*  If I'm Miami, I feel like I can make the finals. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1754.0s)]
*  So I'm making trades. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1757.24s)]
*  Last category, the contenders, Oklahoma City. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1759.56s)]
*  I saw them in person against the Clippers [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1762.6s)]
*  and it was the worst possible check game. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1766.0s)]
*  It made me so sad. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1771.72s)]
*  I was so, I'd never seen them in person. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1773.08s)]
*  I was so excited and they'd played the Lakers night before [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1774.84s)]
*  and it was one of those games. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1777.76s)]
*  It was like the game Mike Evans had in the play. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1778.76s)]
*  It was just like, he had five thumbs. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1780.32s)]
*  He just, you could see his confidence was gone. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1782.68s)]
*  The Clippers were banging him. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1786.6s)]
*  Tice was like jumping over his back for rebounds. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1787.88s)]
*  It was just really bad. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1790.52s)]
*  So Chet, let's have a second date. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1792.88s)]
*  Let's have, give me a Mulligan on that one [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1795.68s)]
*  and maybe look like Chet in the next game. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1797.64s)]
*  Because he's been really good this year. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1799.84s)]
*  I have him as rookie of the year. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1801.12s)]
*  But it did illuminate that they have no protection [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1803.3999999999999s)]
*  for him at all if he's gonna look like a rookie. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1806.04s)]
*  They're gonna have a playoff series in round one, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1809.08s)]
*  round two, round three where it's game four [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1811.0s)]
*  and Chet just looks like a rookie and he sucks. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1813.04s)]
*  You can't then bring in the other Jalen Williams [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1816.52s)]
*  as your backup. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1818.72s)]
*  You need a real center. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1820.0s)]
*  They have to get Claxton, Yacob Pertle, Clint Capella, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1821.1999999999998s)]
*  even Nick Richards, Isaiah Stewart from the Pistons. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1826.28s)]
*  They have to get protection for that dude. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1829.36s)]
*  If they, with all the picks they have, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1831.8799999999999s)]
*  if they do nothing heading into this trade deadline [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1833.84s)]
*  and like we like our guys, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1835.96s)]
*  like that's actually irresponsible. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1837.1599999999999s)]
*  So I fully expect them to do something. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1839.28s)]
*  SGA by the way, plus 12.9 on off. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1842.04s)]
*  And I actually thought Causton, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1844.4399999999998s)]
*  the Lakers and Clippers games, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1847.1599999999999s)]
*  I don't know if you watched the fourth quarters, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1849.2s)]
*  but was missing shots he almost always makes. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1850.6799999999998s)]
*  He didn't seem 100% healthy to me. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1853.56s)]
*  But there was that one play he beat Kawhi off the dribble. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1856.3999999999999s)]
*  And Kawhi kind of timed it [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1860.1599999999999s)]
*  and then had the old Kawhi leap and stuffed it. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1862.3999999999999s)]
*  And it was the best play I've seen in person this year. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1865.96s)]
*  I thought it was one of the best plays of the season. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1868.4399999999998s)]
*  Nobody blocks Shay on that drive. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1870.76s)]
*  He has all of these different looks. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1874.6399999999999s)]
*  Like sometimes he'll go to the right [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1876.08s)]
*  and then he'll drive with his left hand. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1877.84s)]
*  So he goes into the guy. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1879.84s)]
*  So he also gets fouled. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1880.8799999999999s)]
*  He does stuff on his drives that nobody's doing. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1882.12s)]
*  And Kawhi fucking, not only did he block it, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1884.6s)]
*  but he kept it in bounds and started to fast break. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1886.96s)]
*  That game was absolutely, that game was so good. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1889.8s)]
*  I drove home and I did a short while driving in my car [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1892.6399999999999s)]
*  and almost veered into another lane. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1896.6399999999999s)]
*  Anyway, number five, Minnesota. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1898.4399999999998s)]
*  They're 29 and 11. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1901.6s)]
*  I had them slightly over OKC, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1903.48s)]
*  just because I just think Minnesota, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1905.08s)]
*  if they played in this series, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1907.1999999999998s)]
*  Minnesota would just have too much size over seven games. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1908.28s)]
*  Defensive rating first, net rating fourth. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1912.12s)]
*  I was thinking really fascinating moment [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1916.24s)]
*  for Carl Anthony Towns. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1918.32s)]
*  So he's 22 and nine this year. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1920.6399999999999s)]
*  He's 51, 42, 89 percentages. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1922.8s)]
*  So he's basically a 50, 40, 90 guy. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1925.6399999999999s)]
*  Usage rates down in the 26 range. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1928.6399999999999s)]
*  True shootings around 63. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1931.32s)]
*  This season's been a big win for Towns. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1934.48s)]
*  Like they played that awesome game [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1937.04s)]
*  against the Celtics last week, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1938.96s)]
*  which was one of the best games of the year. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1940.1599999999999s)]
*  And I kept waiting for Towns to do as usual dumb town shit [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1941.48s)]
*  and pick up a foul 25 feet from the basket [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1944.28s)]
*  or throw the ball out of bounds [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1947.44s)]
*  or do all the low hoops IQ stuff [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1948.8s)]
*  that he used to do in big games. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1950.96s)]
*  And he just didn't. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1952.1200000000001s)]
*  He was good. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1953.16s)]
*  I'd feel like maybe he's figured it out. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1955.16s)]
*  And if I had to psychoanalyze it, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1957.28s)]
*  maybe having Edwards just clearly be the alpha on this team. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1959.76s)]
*  Maybe set things into place for him, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1964.32s)]
*  because he's really a number two. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1967.1200000000001s)]
*  We always knew he was a number two. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1968.44s)]
*  But the Edwards being a franchise guy so quickly [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1971.52s)]
*  has been for nine different reasons, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1975.84s)]
*  the best things that ever happened to Towns. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1978.12s)]
*  So I was thinking, I had Towns, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1980.1999999999998s)]
*  if you separate all the number one picks since Tim Duncan, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1982.1999999999998s)]
*  and you separate it by yes, maybe, or no. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1985.4399999999998s)]
*  Like, would you do it again? [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1988.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1989.84s)]
*  Would you do it again? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1990.84s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1991.6799999999998s)]
*  Or just no. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1993.12s)]
*  There's been 10 yes guys. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1995.1999999999998s)]
*  Wemby, Palo, Edwards, AD, Kyrie, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=1997.1599999999999s)]
*  Blake Griffin, Derek Rose. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2002.32s)]
*  He's in there. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2005.3600000000001s)]
*  I don't care that he got hurt. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2006.2s)]
*  That was a great pick. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2007.04s)]
*  Dwight Howard, LeBron, and Yao. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2007.96s)]
*  You'd do Yao again. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2011.32s)]
*  So 10 yeses. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2012.68s)]
*  I have eight nos. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2015.3600000000001s)]
*  Deandre Ayton, who I think was a maybe until this year, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2017.96s)]
*  and even I'm out. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2021.76s)]
*  I've sold my Ayton stock. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2025.4s)]
*  I divested Ayton, Foltz, Ben Simmons, Anthony Bennett, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2027.32s)]
*  Greg Oden, Bargnani, Kwame Brown, Ola Wkandy. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2034.76s)]
*  That's eight. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2040.52s)]
*  So I got 10 yeses and eight nos. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2041.56s)]
*  And then there's eight guys in the middle. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2044.6000000000001s)]
*  And some of these guys have retired, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2046.28s)]
*  and I'm still not sure. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2047.56s)]
*  So I'm putting them in the maybes. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2048.4s)]
*  Cade, Zion, Towns, Wiggins, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2051.04s)]
*  who might be veering toward the no. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2057.52s)]
*  I mean, he did help the Warriors win the finals. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2059.8s)]
*  Bogut. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2062.12s)]
*  I stand by Bogut. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2063.36s)]
*  That dude rebounded. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2064.36s)]
*  He set great picks. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2065.32s)]
*  He had some bad luck. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2066.32s)]
*  He had bad luck injuries. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2067.2000000000003s)]
*  Like he broke his elbow that time. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2068.32s)]
*  Bogut's almost a yes to me, but I put him in the maybe. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2070.1600000000003s)]
*  Kenya Martin, who's a borderline yes, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2073.6s)]
*  but didn't quite get there. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2075.84s)]
*  And that Denver contract he signed was abysmal. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2077.2000000000003s)]
*  And then Elton Brand, who I think was on course [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2080.6s)]
*  to be a yes, but then he got hurt. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2083.04s)]
*  Towns has a chance to be a yes, is my point. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2086.84s)]
*  Right now he's maybe. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2091.0s)]
*  He's in with Cade and he's with Zion and Wiggins [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2092.12s)]
*  and Wile and Bogut and Kmart and Brand. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2094.4s)]
*  There's some Wizards fans out there. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2096.68s)]
*  It's like John Wall's a yes. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2097.88s)]
*  No, he wasn't. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2099.08s)]
*  Towns has a chance to play off that list [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2101.6s)]
*  and actually go into the yes list of, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2103.68s)]
*  I'm so glad we took that guy with the number one pick. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2106.08s)]
*  So that's the moment for you, Carl Nathan and Towns. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2109.24s)]
*  You're in your late 20s. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2112.0s)]
*  You've been in the league for a while. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2112.92s)]
*  It's never gonna look better than right now. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2114.04s)]
*  Number four, Philly, 26 and 13. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2116.2s)]
*  Embiid, look, I'm glad you had another great game [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2119.04s)]
*  against Denver at home. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2123.6s)]
*  Can you play in Denver this year? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2125.48s)]
*  Can you do that? [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2128.2799999999997s)]
*  That's all I'm asking. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2130.36s)]
*  Just do it in Denver. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2131.2799999999997s)]
*  Let's see that. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2132.8s)]
*  Embiid's been the best scoring whatever in the league [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2135.0s)]
*  and he's one of the best scoring centers ever. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2139.56s)]
*  And this team is really good, but they still need more. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2144.04s)]
*  They have all these expirings. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2148.52s)]
*  This to me seems like the most logical Bruce Brown team. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2149.8s)]
*  It's a very logical Bogdanovich team. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2152.84s)]
*  And they had the Marcus Morris at 17 million. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2156.4s)]
*  They have Covington at 11. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2158.52s)]
*  They have some other stuff they could package together. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2160.4s)]
*  They could get Frisky with Tobias Harris if they wanted to. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2162.08s)]
*  I wouldn't. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2164.44s)]
*  They could add at least two people. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2166.96s)]
*  And maybe it's Bruce Brown and Caruso. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2169.4s)]
*  Maybe it's Bogdanovich and Caruso. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2171.52s)]
*  But this team has a chance to win a title. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2173.08s)]
*  And you know who's never won a title? [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2175.16s)]
*  Not just Joe Embiid, Darrell Maury. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2177.88s)]
*  I think he's going all in on this one. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2181.0s)]
*  That would be my guess. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2183.52s)]
*  Number three, LA Clippers, 26 and 14. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2184.6800000000003s)]
*  I did a short on my YouTube channel about this [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2191.48s)]
*  because I was driving home from that OKC game [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2194.8s)]
*  and I was like, oh my God. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2197.08s)]
*  Like they literally looked like a finals team. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2200.6800000000003s)]
*  I think Denver is gonna make the finals, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2202.88s)]
*  but this was a team. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2204.36s)]
*  The team I watched the other night [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2206.08s)]
*  was a team that could play in the finals. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2207.36s)]
*  The unselfishness, they got good shots [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2209.52s)]
*  over and over and over again. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2212.76s)]
*  Kawagard had Shea down the stretch [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2214.76s)]
*  when they needed a couple stops. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2216.6800000000003s)]
*  And they were always, even if he got switches, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2218.08s)]
*  they were still able to defend him. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2220.32s)]
*  Tice and Plumlee, like not awful. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2223.36s)]
*  They just need guys to set picks and bang bodies [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2226.28s)]
*  and have their hands around the rim. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2228.8s)]
*  And then Zubot just come back in a couple of weeks. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2230.32s)]
*  But the crazy thing to me about this team, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2232.52s)]
*  I thought when they made this trade, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2235.4s)]
*  I thought it was one of the dumbest trades, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2236.6s)]
*  even for the Clippers in their history, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2238.12s)]
*  was not as hard and just seemed like he was past his prime. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2241.36s)]
*  They're betting on three older veterans [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2246.24s)]
*  to just figure out on the fly how to coexist [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2249.2799999999997s)]
*  and make each other better. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2252.08s)]
*  And all of the history of the NBA said [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2253.92s)]
*  that this was not going to work. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2256.96s)]
*  And yet so far, it's worked incredibly well. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2259.0s)]
*  And I've been to a couple of the games now [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2263.16s)]
*  and I'm just like, this works. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2265.32s)]
*  I don't know what else to say. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2266.6400000000003s)]
*  The shocking part is the usage, right? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2268.2400000000002s)]
*  So Harden was 25 usage last year, he's 20 this year. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2270.36s)]
*  It's a pretty big concession for him. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2274.0800000000004s)]
*  George goes down 29 and a half to 27.2 [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2276.04s)]
*  and Kawhi goes down 27 and 25.9. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2279.0800000000004s)]
*  And usually when guys are sacrificing stuff, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2282.2000000000003s)]
*  their stats are gonna look worse [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2284.7200000000003s)]
*  or they're gonna have a little problem [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2286.6000000000004s)]
*  kind of like what's happening in Westbrook. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2288.76s)]
*  All of their percentages, Harden's at 45, 42, 87. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2291.1200000000003s)]
*  George is 47, 42, 91. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2294.92s)]
*  Kawhi's at 52, 44, 88. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2297.92s)]
*  These guys have gotten better by having the ball less. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2300.64s)]
*  And when you watch them in person, it makes sense [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2303.56s)]
*  because Harden is like traffic hopping out there. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2306.96s)]
*  He's just like, the ball's flying around. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2309.12s)]
*  It's the complete opposite of how he used to play. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2311.2000000000003s)]
*  The ball doesn't really stick with anybody. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2315.6s)]
*  I thought it was gonna be a lot of ice ball stuff [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2317.2400000000002s)]
*  and it's just not. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2319.0s)]
*  But I was thinking about like sacrifice guys [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2321.16s)]
*  over the years that actually won titles. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2323.92s)]
*  So you're going way back to like Earl Monroe in the 1973 Knicks [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2326.48s)]
*  who could have scored 28 points a game [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2329.6800000000003s)]
*  but really gave up stuff to play in that team and fit in. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2331.44s)]
*  Robert Parrish was like that on the Celtics. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2335.0s)]
*  Rashid was like that in 2004 on the Pistons. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2336.96s)]
*  Ray Allen in 2008 on the Celtics is an unbelievable example. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2339.96s)]
*  Like he gave up, I would say eight shots a game. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2343.2000000000003s)]
*  Chris Bosh on Miami, Kevin Love on Cleveland in 2016. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2345.96s)]
*  These guys, I'm kind of buying it. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2350.36s)]
*  It feels like they're giving up stats and possessions [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2354.56s)]
*  because they see some sort of greater good. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2359.7599999999998s)]
*  It's to me the biggest surprise that's happened to NBA [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2362.48s)]
*  in the last couple of years. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2365.7599999999998s)]
*  The team makes sense together. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2366.8399999999997s)]
*  Now, could it go sideways tomorrow? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2368.08s)]
*  Could somebody get hurt? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2370.08s)]
*  Of course. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2371.16s)]
*  And somebody probably will get hurt [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2372.3999999999996s)]
*  because it's three older players [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2373.7599999999998s)]
*  but they really play well together. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2374.9199999999996s)]
*  I gotta say this is the most fun quipper team [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2377.2s)]
*  they've ever had. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2379.6s)]
*  I am somebody who hated watching [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2381.44s)]
*  James Harden play basketball. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2382.8s)]
*  I really like watching him play this year. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2384.08s)]
*  What's happening to me? [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2387.12s)]
*  Last category, the favorites. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2389.04s)]
*  Denver is number two and then the Celtics at number one. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2391.1600000000003s)]
*  The Celtics are 20 and 0 at home now. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2398.28s)]
*  This is starting to matter, right? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2404.36s)]
*  Oh, I get to bring in the 86 Celtics. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2407.04s)]
*  They went 50 and 1. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2408.56s)]
*  They went 40 and 1 that season [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2409.72s)]
*  and got their ass kicked by Portland, the only game. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2412.3999999999996s)]
*  I think now we're in the 20s. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2415.16s)]
*  I think this is a streak that's gonna matter. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2416.3599999999997s)]
*  They're still being really careful. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2418.08s)]
*  They're resting guys. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2419.24s)]
*  They have to be careful with Port Zingas. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2420.16s)]
*  59 weeks out of Port Zingas. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2422.72s)]
*  They need to get Horford there. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2424.9199999999996s)]
*  They need to make sure Tatum doesn't play 3,000 minutes. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2426.56s)]
*  So they're gonna do some stuff [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2428.8399999999997s)]
*  but what they've done in the way Missoula has kind of [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2430.7999999999997s)]
*  sat guys, put people in, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2433.44s)]
*  he keeps the infrastructure of whatever the team is [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2435.12s)]
*  no matter who's in or out. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2437.92s)]
*  And it's kind of working. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2439.88s)]
*  Like they beat, they rested white [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2442.0s)]
*  and Port Zingas yesterday against San Antonio. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2444.12s)]
*  Not, I mean, you're gonna beat San Antonio [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2447.28s)]
*  but the team never, even if guys are missing, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2448.96s)]
*  the team still feels like it plays the same way. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2451.8s)]
*  The two big things from a Celtic standpoint [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2454.36s)]
*  from the last two weeks [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2456.84s)]
*  that really make me feel like they're getting it [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2458.44s)]
*  is I mentioned before when Tatum guarded [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2461.08s)]
*  Shea down the stretch in that OKC game. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2463.48s)]
*  I don't think he would have done that a year ago. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2465.76s)]
*  I think he wanted to go mono a mono with them. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2467.44s)]
*  I think he's understanding like, hey, in this game [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2469.6800000000003s)]
*  we need my defense and my rebounding as much as my scoring. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2472.0s)]
*  And then what Jaylen did in the Minnesota game last week [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2475.44s)]
*  was awesome. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2477.76s)]
*  He rebounded, he played defense, he picked his spots. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2479.04s)]
*  I thought that was one of the best games he's ever played. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2483.7200000000003s)]
*  And I just think this team is really close [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2486.04s)]
*  and really likes each other. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2488.4s)]
*  And you even see there was an airplane photo the other day. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2489.56s)]
*  They took this photo of them in the airplane. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2491.48s)]
*  They're all in there and it's just, it's a tight team. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2493.12s)]
*  It's going to be interesting to see [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2496.0s)]
*  if they even do anything at the trade deadline [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2497.8s)]
*  because sometimes when you strike oil [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2499.68s)]
*  with a combination of guys, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2501.76s)]
*  you don't want to fuck with it at all. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2503.48s)]
*  I still feel like they need a bigger guard [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2504.64s)]
*  on those Prichard nights when the opponent is long and tough. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2507.28s)]
*  But to Celtic's team, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2510.36s)]
*  this is the best chance they've had [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2513.32s)]
*  to win a title since 2009. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2514.68s)]
*  And I know they're in the finals in 22, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2516.32s)]
*  but that team, I always felt like it was a year [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2517.92s)]
*  too early for them. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2521.04s)]
*  This team is excellent. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2522.12s)]
*  And poor Zingas is the X factor because he's the cheat code. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2523.56s)]
*  He's the superpower of the team. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2528.08s)]
*  So we'll see if he can stay healthy. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2529.44s)]
*  Last but not least, Adam Silver. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2531.88s)]
*  I usually grade him at the end of the Power Pole. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2533.64s)]
*  Nothing's really happened with him. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2536.92s)]
*  Oh, thumbs up because he gave the Clippers [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2538.92s)]
*  the 2026 All-Star Game. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2541.68s)]
*  Thank you, Adam Silver. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2543.4s)]
*  You're on my good list this week. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2544.8s)]
*  You're on my good list this week. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvMUdvkogs&t=2553.52s)]
