# Six Major Things Going On in the NBA With Bill Simmons  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [December 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxte-LFOYjc)
*  Brought to you by Miklo Bultra, the official beer sponsor of the NBA, my favorite league,
*  the NBA Cup.
*  Not only is it underway, the semifinals are this weekend in Vegas.
*  Miklo Bultra Quartzside ready to get fans closer to the action.
*  Sign up for Miklo Bultra for a chance to win Quartzside seats, a trip to the Paris global
*  game.
*  That sounds fun.
*  A trip to All-Star Weekend and other prizes.
*  the game than ever before.
*  I'm going to open a six pack.
*  Six things I've noticed, six things I want to talk about.
*  We hit a little bit with Jacoby and Goldsberry on Tuesday night's podcast.
*  Specifically, we talked about Jimmy Butler and Golden State and how from a Golden State
*  standpoint, you saw it last night too.
*  I think they have a two to three year window here with Curry and Draymond to compete for
*  a title.
*  Whether they're going to win a title remains to be seen.
*  They need one more offensive player, somebody who can take the burden.
*  You saw in the game last night, they're up six with two and a half minutes left and just
*  some of the worst possessions you could possibly have.
*  They become very easy to stop at the end of the game.
*  So Jimmy Butler is somebody that makes sense for them and kind of fits in with him, Draymond
*  and some role players.
*  You can kind of see it.
*  It's not nothing.
*  So he makes $48.8 million this year and he's a player option.
*  The player option is key because everybody thinks that he's either going to opt out at
*  the end of the year and become a free agent or he'll want to do an extension with Miami,
*  which Miami Clear doesn't want to do because they've had a year and a half to do it.
*  OK, so we talked about some of the apron stuff on Tuesday and how hard it is to make trades
*  in the NBA right now.
*  And I was saying how on the one hand, I kind of like it because it's a little more like
*  the NFL guys are kind of stuck in their situations.
*  You can't just decide you're unhappy in a month and be, I want to go somewhere else.
*  You look at Brandon Ingram, you look at Zach Levine.
*  These are guys that are actually, well, Ingram just got hurt, but guys that were playing
*  pretty well in situations that they weren't happy with because they didn't really have
*  any other choice.
*  And that could be how it plays out with Jimmy Butler.
*  On the other hand, we've already seen that he can get a little frisky if he's not happy.
*  I think Miami is feeling that pressure too.
*  And if you're Miami, where are you going?
*  You're light years away from the Boston OKC Cleveland group.
*  You're not even really a second tier contender.
*  You're probably a second and a half tier contender.
*  And maybe you could use Butler's contract.
*  You could put Roger with it.
*  You could try to create a new world for yourself where you're basically just paying hero and
*  bam and Duncan Robinson's last year, next year and some other things.
*  And you're under 110 million heading into free agency this summer with a lot of options.
*  You might just want to blow it up and redo it.
*  The problem is this apron stuff.
*  And for Miami, it's not that bad because they are not hard capped.
*  They're over the first apron.
*  They're under the second apron, not hard capped, which means you can actually make four for
*  twos, three for twos, four for threes, all those kind of trades.
*  But some of the teams that they would be trading with, it's just not realistic with the apron.
*  Like Shams reported he had Dallas and Phoenix and some teams that I just don't think there's
*  any way, shape or form that there's a trade to be had with either side because of the
*  apron stuff and because of the lack of assets.
*  But that did lead to Jimmy's agent, Bernie Lee, getting really mad at Shams, which I
*  loved.
*  He's one of my, the only agents that actually like anyway, Golden State.
*  So Golden State is hard capped at the first apron.
*  I swear there's not going to be a test after this and 1.7 million under the second apron,
*  which is key because that means they can make three for ones, four for twos, stuff like
*  that as long as they don't pop over the second apron.
*  I'm sorry.
*  This is so much math.
*  Here's the trade.
*  It would be Wiggins and Kaminga and Melton who's out for the year.
*  Right?
*  So they're making $46.6 million and Jimmy's making $48.8 million.
*  Well, that doesn't work for Golden State.
*  They also only have 14 guys.
*  So if they do have four for one, they would have to then sign more guys to get to 14 because
*  that's the rule.
*  Well, that doesn't work either.
*  So I don't really know how it works with Golden State unless they dump one of their guys,
*  Kyle Anderson, Gary Payton, Moses Moody, who they just signed to an extension.
*  They'd have to dump somebody to a third team.
*  And I always get suspicious when that becomes in play.
*  This is why Houston just seems like such a logical team to me.
*  And I know they're on a high right now.
*  They just made the NBA Cup semifinals with some help from Bill Kennedy.
*  Great call.
*  Always want to call that loose ball foul.
*  When guys dive on each other, which never gets called ever, you definitely want to decide
*  a game that way.
*  Great job by him.
*  The problem for Houston right now is the end of the game stuff.
*  And you saw it yesterday.
*  As I've said before, they're probably my favorite league pass team.
*  But the end of the game stuff is where it gets a little dodgy with them.
*  And a lot of that has to do with Fred Van Vliet, who just has not been that good this
*  year.
*  16 points a game, all shooting stats are down.
*  And he's also a team option for next year at 42.9 million.
*  So you could actually use Van Vliet as part of a mega trade, right?
*  So they have Steven Adams at 12.6.
*  They have Green and Tate at 8.7 and a half that are expiring.
*  They have a lot of options too.
*  They also have a ton of picks.
*  They have a couple of Brooklyn picks, a couple of Phoenix picks.
*  They own some of their own firsts.
*  So they have a lot of flexibility and maneuverability.
*  And the trade that I created, being the Picasso of the trade machine, if it's Van Vliet and
*  it's Adams is expiring and Tate's expiring and Cam Whitmore, who I actually like, who's
*  just buried because he's got the terror twins in front of him, Shailen Green.
*  And you get Butler and Roger back and you put a pick in that trade.
*  And Miami is saving seven million just on that deal.
*  Plus they get a pick.
*  They get to look at Whitmore.
*  They get Van Vliet.
*  They get to kind of stay peripherally competitive this year.
*  They could still move Van Vliet in a one for one trade if they wanted to, if it was a salary
*  close.
*  That trade makes sense to me for both sides because it allows Miami to reboot.
*  It allows Houston to end up with Butler, Brooks, Shungun, Green, Roger, Jabari, the terror
*  twins and Landell.
*  And I already had them third or fourth in the West anyway.
*  And I like Van Vliet.
*  Oh, I forgot Shepherd too.
*  I like Van Vliet, but I think they could get by with Adam and you put Butler and Butler
*  now becomes the end of the game guy.
*  I think you'd have a chip on his shoulder.
*  That's the trade I'm rooting for.
*  I just think that's a fun trade for everybody.
*  It would be yet another Miami situation where they're doing a reboot and it seems like it's
*  bleak and they're done.
*  And then all of a sudden they're a 55 win team again because they make two moves.
*  Anyway, that is number one leading to number two.
*  What the hell does Golden State do if they can't get Jimmy Butler?
*  Because I don't, I think it's really hard to pull off.
*  You're going to have to trade a pick in a Jimmy Butler trade.
*  You have to trade another pick to get rid of the contract you need to make it happen
*  or put Pud Zemsky.
*  Send him somewhere else to create the thing.
*  Like is it worth it to trade Wiggins and Kaminga and Melton and a pick and then send Pud Zemsky
*  somewhere else to get another asset to get Jimmy Butler?
*  I don't think it is.
*  My advice for them, the Brooklyn Nets are in a bizarre situation right now where they're
*  playing really well and they're overachieving because Jordy Fernandez has been a revelation
*  as a coach.
*  It really reminds me of Will Hardy that first year in Utah, Brad Stevens his first year
*  in Boston.
*  We see this happen from time to time where the coach is just too good for the tank.
*  So Brooklyn's going to have to start sabotaging their own team and they have Cam Johnson who's
*  having the best year of his career.
*  19 a game, 45% three.
*  I test looks the best he's been.
*  28 years old.
*  He's a little older than I think you think he is.
*  But if I was going to stay out of Audible and go after Cam Johnson and Schreuger and
*  something we can do with Wiggins.
*  Do we want to put Kaminga in that?
*  If we don't want to pay Kaminga next year, could you turn Kaminga into Cam Johnson basically?
*  Could it be Kaminga and Melton for Cam Johnson?
*  Is there some version of would you rather pay Cam Johnson 22 million than Kaminga for
*  30?
*  Do you try to get Schreuder in it?
*  Could it be Wiggins, Melton and an unprotected first for Johnson and Schreuder?
*  Does Kaminga even need that bit?
*  It just feels like Brooklyn Golden State seems to match up.
*  So keep an eye on that.
*  I don't think Golden State is going to be able to get a second star.
*  I don't see a scenario where they get LeBron and Bronny back.
*  LeBron and Bronny making 50 million combined.
*  They'd have all the same problems that they would have trying to get Jimmy Butler that
*  I just laid out.
*  On top of the fact that LeBron is at his 22nd season and doesn't play defense anymore.
*  So Brooklyn seems like the spot for them.
*  I'm still bullish on this Golden State team, but Curry needs some help.
*  Next thing.
*  So the Wilt 50 Club, which I just created one second ago, where you have to play 50
*  games and you have to average 50 points, rebounds and assists combined at least.
*  And it is not as easy as you think, my friends.
*  Just since the merger, Kareem did it three times.
*  Highest was 56 in 1971.
*  Luca did it last year, 52.9.
*  Russ did it in his MVP season, 52.7.
*  Bob McAdoo?
*  50.8 in 1975.
*  Giannis is doing it right now, 50.1.
*  Harden did it in 2019, 50.3.
*  And Jokic?
*  56.1 right now, which would be the single highest number anyone has done since Wilt
*  and Russ were playing.
*  So the reason it's the Wilt 50 Club.
*  Wilt has the top six.
*  Wilt has 10 in the top 11.
*  Wilt averaged a 78.4 points, rebounds, assists combined in 1962.
*  That's insane.
*  Oscar Robertson did it five times.
*  Pettit did it twice.
*  Elgin did it twice.
*  Walt Bellamy did it once.
*  We don't count Walt Bellamy.
*  Jordan's highest ever, 48.9.
*  Shaq's highest ever, 47.1.
*  Bird, 45.8.
*  LeBron, 45.6.
*  Kobe, 45.2.
*  Just getting to 50 is really hard.
*  I like the 50 Club.
*  Let's create it.
*  Jokic right now, 32, 14, and 10.
*  And he's shooting 56, 50, and 81%.
*  33.2 PER.
*  This season's just insane.
*  But I don't know how high this goes,
*  because it's too high right now.
*  He's not going to be continuing to do the stuff
*  that he's been doing.
*  It's not realistic.
*  But could he end up 31, 13, and nine?
*  Could he end up 32, 13, and 10?
*  I don't know.
*  I'm prepared for anything,
*  because nobody on the team could score.
*  So the 50 Club.
*  I think Jokic.
*  Kareem is the highest ever, 56.0.
*  I think Jokic could potentially set the record.
*  I'm in on the 50 Club.
*  All right, they wanted me to do a superior take,
*  and I have one, of course.
*  I've been thinking a lot about the fouling
*  at the end of the game stuff,
*  because there was the Celtics Cavaliers game,
*  which has now become infamous,
*  I think it was a week and a half ago.
*  Celtics are down four with under 30 seconds left.
*  There are 18 free throw attempts in the last 26 seconds.
*  Both teams just were fouling each other.
*  Everybody was like, nobody's going to shoot a three.
*  Well, I'll foul you two, and it just becomes a foul off.
*  Final score was 115 to 111.
*  There were 20 points scored in the last 26 seconds
*  because of all the free throws.
*  And I think I speak for everyone.
*  This sucks.
*  The free throw parade down the stretch is abominable,
*  and it feels like it's getting worse.
*  So how do we fix it?
*  Well, I have a regular season fix for this.
*  If you foul somebody in the last minute of a game,
*  no matter what the score is,
*  whether you're leading or trailing,
*  the first free throw counts for two points.
*  And that's it.
*  And if you make it, you get basically the two points
*  for the free throws, the game keeps going.
*  If you miss it, you still get to shoot a second free throw,
*  but that only counts for one point.
*  So when we have these foul offs at the end,
*  Pritchard gets fouled by Cleveland,
*  even though they're up four.
*  If Pritchard hits one, now it's a two point game,
*  and that's how it goes.
*  And I really think it would work.
*  I don't know who would be against it.
*  And let's speed these games up,
*  because the other option is the Elam ending,
*  which nobody really understands.
*  Two points for your first free throw
*  in the last minute of the game.
*  Let's try it in the regular season.
*  Let's see if it works.
*  And if it works, we do it for the playoffs.
*  That's my superior take.
*  All right.
*  Two more things really quick.
*  Who could be next year's out of nowhere young contender?
*  So this would be a team playing right now.
*  That a year from now, maybe it would look like the Rockets
*  right now as one of the best four teams in the West.
*  The Rockets were 41 and 41 last year.
*  Maybe it looks like OKC last year when they won 57 games
*  the year before they were 40 and 42.
*  Maybe it looks like Memphis in 2022 when they won 56 games
*  the year before they were 38 and 34.
*  So a team that's around 500, maybe a little bit lower,
*  but has some pedigree, at least one young star
*  with a chance to be really great, need to be around 500,
*  need to have some other fun pieces.
*  And there's two candidates, one for each conference.
*  The Pistons.
*  This is a team Rosillo has been very focused on.
*  I always admire Rosillo's love for weirdly compelling
*  East Coast teams.
*  Detroit's 10 for 15.
*  Played a pretty hard schedule.
*  They lost to Boston twice, lost to Milwaukee twice,
*  lost to Cleveland, lost to Houston, lost to Memphis,
*  lost to Orlando, split with the Knicks.
*  And they've been hanging around a lot of these games.
*  And Rosillo's made this point in his pod, but these early
*  afternoon, like four o'clock games, you're usually stuck
*  with like whatever the 7 p.m. Eastern.
*  So I've actually watched some Detroit and I've watched some
*  Charlotte and I like what Detroit has going.
*  Better than Monty Williams as a coach, which is the
*  number one thing, but Cades 24 points a game, seven rebounds,
*  nine assists.
*  He has hit every sort of ceiling you would have thought
*  he was going to hit at this point.
*  Shoot almost 40% from three.
*  Like he's just really good.
*  He's somebody that you could build a team around.
*  Beasley and Harris were two pretty smart for agent signings.
*  They're averaging 30 a game and shooting 40% from three.
*  Jade and Ivy has been good.
*  They have rebounding.
*  And I wonder like if I'm them, fuck it.
*  Do I do a trade?
*  Do I try to get, you know, Brandon Ingram's on a discount?
*  Zach Levine's on a discount.
*  CJ McCollum's on a discount.
*  Do I think about Jimmy Butler?
*  They don't have to worry about any of this apron stuff.
*  This could be another Cam Johnson team.
*  This is actually kind of a perfect Cam Johnson team.
*  I wonder if Detroit is going to look at what happened with
*  Orlando and OKC the last couple of years and what's happening
*  with Houston this year and think like, hmm, I wonder if we make
*  one move here.
*  Could our ceiling increase, especially if Miami goes backwards?
*  Indiana has already gone backwards.
*  Could we be a top 16 potentially?
*  So I'm watching them.
*  The other team is obviously San Antonio, who's 12 and 12, which
*  is surprising because I haven't really enjoyed watching them.
*  So I'm Castle and Johnson shoot 27% from three combined.
*  Chris Paul better season than we expected, but he's older.
*  Who knows of them?
*  But the foundation I like, they've won me and can't be
*  better than they are.
*  I'm watching them.
*  But the foundation I like, they've won me and Castle and Harrison
*  Barnes and Paul's.
*  They have some good vets.
*  They have a couple of heat check dudes and they have a lot of picks.
*  They have a shitload of picks.
*  And I wonder, is that a Cam Johnson team?
*  Probably not a Jimmy Butler team, but could it be like a CJ McCollum
*  team?
*  I'm watching them to see.
*  Are they just going to be happy to be a 500 team again?
*  I don't know why they would be because they're going to be too
*  good to tank.
*  They're not going to be in the top five or top six.
*  So maybe think about going for it, which leads me to the sixth and
*  last thing for the six pack.
*  Atlanta, a team that I really liked before the season.
*  You probably remember from the over under pod house and I went all
*  in on their over a team that I mentioned last week when house and
*  I after million dollar picks were tucked about a big futures.
*  I doubled down when I was in Denver last week on Fandel with the
*  Atlanta over under stuff because it was 38 and a half right now.
*  They're 14 and 12.
*  They upset the Knicks last night and it wasn't even really an upset.
*  I thought they kind of dominated them in the second half and I really
*  do wonder if that was a playoff series.
*  I would be super scared if I was the Knicks because they don't really
*  have a way to control the tray young dribble slash dribble penetration,
*  whatever we're calling it these days.
*  Their wings kind of match up against the Knicks wings, the Atlanta
*  wings.
*  They have rebounding.
*  It's just, I think that's a dangerous matchup for them.
*  Their third and pace, which I like, and I wonder if Atlanta has a real
*  chance to become this year's Pacers.
*  Um, the key for them, two things.
*  One is the three point shooting.
*  Daniels is only at 31%.
*  Reach the shade is 28% trace 31%, which is bad.
*  Hunter has been overachieving.
*  He's 45%, but can those swings start hitting more threes?
*  Then secondly, what are we getting from Trey?
*  I think, I think this is it.
*  I think we've hit the let's figure this out once and for all moment with Trey,
*  almost like a political candidate for an election.
*  Um, he's been dining off that conference finals thing for a few years now,
*  which I think we all know happened because.
*  Embiid was super banged up.
*  There were a couple of fluky games and Ben Simmons basically had a basketball
*  mental breakdown and just completely lost it for whatever reason.
*  Trey this year, 21 and 12, 12 assists a game solid 38% shooting 31% from three,
*  which doesn't stop them from launching the 29 footers free throws are down to
*  six a game.
*  They used to be at nine turnovers highest.
*  They've ever been 4.6.
*  And with all of that said, this is the perfect team for him.
*  He's got swings everywhere.
*  He's got a bunch of guys to protect them on defense.
*  Daniels, whatever, whoever the other team's point guard is, you saw it with
*  the next game with Brunson.
*  Daniels can guard every team's point guard, small guard, whoever it is,
*  Mitchell Garland, name a guy you can put, uh, you can put Daniels on them.
*  They're playing the box.
*  He can guard them lower.
*  He can guard anybody in the league who's under six, eight and Jalen Johnson.
*  You know, if you're ranking the swings, Jalen Johnson, Daniels, OJ and OBI and
*  bridges, I think I would take Jalen Johnson over the other three guys and
*  Daniels is going to be a first team all NBA defense guy.
*  So perfect spot for Trey.
*  He's got rebounding.
*  He's got shop blocking.
*  He's got lob guys.
*  He's got tall interchangeable shooters all over the place.
*  And I don't, I was thinking like, what would the trade be?
*  Should maybe they go get cam Johnson's like, I'm not even sure they need to do
*  a trade, especially now that Bogdanovich is back and they have some six man
*  scoring stuff.
*  It really comes down to Trey Young.
*  How good is he?
*  Cause he is in the perfect race car for him right now.
*  And maybe over the course of these next 20, 25 games, he's going to start
*  figuring it out.
*  He's a guy that you saw in the next game in MSG.
*  Um, the bigger the stage, the more he seems to like it, whether he's missing
*  29 footers or not.
*  Um, he's one of the, him and Lamello are the two irrational confidence
*  superstars that we have right now.
*  And if, if we're ever going to find out that Trey Young can be a real piece
*  on a team that wins 50 games and actually competes in a real way, it should
*  start happening right around now.
*  So maybe we'll see it.
*  Maybe we'll see it on Saturday against Milwaukee in the NBA cup.
*  Anyway, that was today's six major things.
