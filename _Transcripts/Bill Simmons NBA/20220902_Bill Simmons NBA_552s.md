# Are the Cavaliers True Contenders With the Addition of Donovan Mitchell? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [September 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5daH5EjvQm0)
*  I want to start with Cleveland because I thought if Cleveland or Memphis got
*  Mitchell, that was a game changer for either of those teams.
*  Like, I don't think Mitchell is a true number one.
*  I think he's somewhere between a one and a two, but the framework of those teams.
*  I felt like if either of those teams can get Mitchell, they're a contender.
*  Now you look at Cleveland, Mowgli under contract, you know, forever, um,
*  Sexton under contract for a while.
*  Now Mitchell under contract for four years.
*  Jared Allen is the fourth.
*  What are you thinking as a contender for this team?
*  Because I don't think they're going to contend this year.
*  Like, but I think they could be super frisky the way Memphis was.
*  But down the road of this decade, I really like that as a foursome.
*  What'd you think?
*  I love this trade for Cleveland.
*  Love, love, love this trade.
*  Um, I think we should probably spend some time on talking about who Donovan Mitchell
*  is. I think it's one of those things where we all actually probably agree, but we
*  pretend we disagree on the overrated, underrated thing.
*  As far as being a number one, like when somebody says, Oh, can he be the
*  Batman on the championship team?
*  The answer's no.
*  The answer's no for probably 444 players in the league.
*  All right.
*  Right.
*  Uh, the, the Batman thing on his end, first of all, nobody can do it on their own.
*  The list of guys that truly are a franchise changing gr it's never a double
*  digit number to me.
*  It's always seven or eight.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe at best.
*  So, all right, fine.
*  Mitchell isn't that, but what is he?
*  He's somebody where I'm looking at my all star, uh, not my all star, my all NBA
*  voting, where I'm going like, can I sneak them onto the third team?
*  Would that be terrible?
*  That's how good he is.
*  And when you factor in, uh, what he's done so far in his career as a
*  playoff guy, now I know everybody's off.
*  Everything that's happened with Utah, um, because everybody's just kind of
*  anti Utah, they get sick of this team, not getting past the second around.
*  But you know that, that series against Phoenix, man, like that is other worldly
*  shit that he was doing against that team.
*  Uh, excuse me, against Denver.
*  Yeah.
*  57, 30, 20, 51, 30, 44, 22.
*  So when I've watched a lot of Mitchell and is, if I wanted to spin this as
*  like anti Mitchell, I'd be like, yeah, you know, there's a little stuff in there.
*  He forces the issue and maybe not the greatest playmaker.
*  A whiff of Westbrook.
*  Just a little, I always say that little, little Westbrook light,
*  a little concerning at times.
*  I think that also could be him frustrated with his teammates, which, you
*  know, whatever we'll pay attention.
*  We'll monitor that.
*  But when you talk about the rest of who this guy is at 25 years old, and once you
*  accept that there just aren't that many guys at all, all sudden make you a
*  championship contender, this is an incredible pickup, which I think
*  identifies a massive problem for the calves.
*  When I would watch them late in games, it was Darius Garland dribbling around for
*  fucking ever trying to figure out like, I have to initiate the offense on every
*  one of these type possessions here late.
*  This completely changes their offensive attack late in games.
*  They thought they were going to solve with Caris LaVert because
*  everybody likes Caris LaVert until he's on your basketball team.
*  And then you're like, Oh wait, this guy, this guy just kind of does whatever he
*  wants.
*  So the Cleveland part, I love this for them.
*  We like Mitchell as even if he's a little overrated, I think some people
*  might think he's a super duper star.
*  Maybe people have cooled off on that, but what he is is a gunslinger.
*  If I'm in a playoff series or I'm in a big game and the other team has
*  somebody who's really good.
*  And now I know, at least on my side, I have a guy who can create a shot.
*  Garland showed signs during the regular season as somebody who his ceiling
*  was kind of where Mitchell is right now.
*  But as somebody who could be the creator, playmaker on a team that was really,
*  really good, that could even win a couple of rounds.
*  Mitchell's Mitchell's already there.
*  I really wanted Mitchell to go to a team where he was part of a bigger team, like
*  a, like an 89 Pistons type of situation where they just had a lot of good players.
*  And it's like, all right, here's what this guy's good at.
*  If it's a tie game with four minutes left, he can create his own shot and he
*  could do stuff.
*  And the other thing that the big guys can protect him on this team, right?
*  Cause you would think like, all right, what's the, what's your
*  concern now with these guys?
*  The way Mitchell played defense the last couple of years, this year,
*  it was an abomination.
*  But, but it also, there might've been some effort stuff too.
*  And he also took a lot of shit for it.
*  So maybe he'll raise the stakes.
*  But the point is when you have Allen and Mobley, especially Mobley, you can
*  erase a lot of stuff with that.
*  And that's why like, man, I know you talk about a lot of picks in this trade,
*  but I don't really want picks that much on the team that Evan Mobley's on.
*  I think you and I might rate him at we're in the, we're in the
*  highest level of Mobley fans, right?
*  But this is, there's a chance this is Tim Duncan in the late 90s, where that
*  he could have that kind of moment.
*  I just think he's such a special player.
*  Now you're giving him two awesome playmaking guards and you're giving him
*  Jared Allen as now the fourth guy in the team and they still have the
*  Kevin Love contract to trade.
*  That was the part that amazement that I thought Kevin Love was going to be in
*  this trade now that they potentially can do something with that in February,
*  maybe Laverte and Love together.
*  So just the four guys, if that's my nucleus for the rest of the decade, I'm
*  pumped and I, I, I wasn't surprised that we saw this the same way.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, I mean, there's still a million things I could do on the team.
*  Like if you look at the Cavs, right.
*  Um, it was a really good story and it was a young team that was playing really good
*  defense.
*  Uh, they at one point were 35 and 21.
*  They finished the season nine and 17 to close and as their seeding was starting
*  to fall off, I was like, Oh man, like I really wanted you to be in that top six.
*  Uh, but they defended really well as a young team.
*  The reason they fell off is Jared Allen got hurt.
*  He played only six or 24 games in the second half.
*  So when you look at who they were defensively before the all star break,
*  they were fourth and after the all star break, they dropped to 24th.
*  So they were a completely different team defensively.
*  And a lot of that had to do with Allen.
*  Mobly is only going to be better.
*  I'd like to see, you know, this is the rarefied air to even mention Duncan with
*  anybody.
*  Like, I don't really want to do that.
*  I didn't take it lightly, but you know, I'd like to, if I were being super, super
*  hyper critical of, of Mobly, I'd like to see some of the offense initiation be
*  maybe a little bit smoother, but it's still too early to even be like, Hey, this
*  is an issue.
*  But you love the passing with them.
*  I love all of it.
*  Yeah.
*  He doesn't make mistakes.
*  He's fucking positioned perfectly.
*  His block rate is insane.
*  So even if you're going, all right, well now you have Garland and Mitchell who
*  defensively, by the way, Mitchell, you know, it's funny cause I'll hear like
*  small guard, small guard.
*  First of all, he's stout in his wingspan, six, 10 with that kind of wingspan and
*  that kind of athleticism, you being anything below average as a defender is
*  on you.
*  That's an effort thing.
*  And like, just, you're not trying hard enough.
*  Yeah.
*  So that, that part, you know, always pisses me off when I see you guys like,
*  what, how are you, how are you not better defensively?
*  And again, that Dallas thing, we, you know, we, we've been over it already,
*  but you're right.
*  Filtering to those bigs that are switchable and seeing how much the
*  defense completely fell apart.
*  Like as much as I felt like the stats don't back it up much, but I'm not wrong
*  about this when I watched them on offense in a close type possession, last couple
*  minutes, some of the Garland clutch offensive efficiency does dip down.
*  It's not, it's not as dramatic as maybe my eyes.
*  But they were asking a laugh from him though.
*  I think that's part of the problem.
*  That's it.
*  None of it to me is on him because I think he's a very willing teammate.
*  I think they were just lost because you know, marketing to me is always kind
*  of a disappointment.
*  We can get into that part of it.
*  Obviously sex only played the 11 games.
*  Laverte's a mess.
*  Acoro's not much offensively and you're just, you were left at so many
*  Cleveland games at the very end going, I just wish they had another attacking
*  guy and they got one of the best ones you're ever going to get your hands on.
*  I'm glad you mentioned Acoro because he's one of the winners of this trade.
*  Hey Acoro, you're never going to have, we're never going to run and play for you.
*  You're going to shoot corner threes, practice 5,000 a day and guard the
*  other team's best guy.
*  You have two jobs.
*  That's it.
*  We, you don't have to do anything else.
*  You might have to run a couple.
*  You might the wing on like two fast breaks a game.
*  Other than that, you're in the corner and you're guarding the other team's best guy.
*  And the Moby thing we've talked about him before.
*  I think he has a chance to be like a trance, a transcendent defensive player.
*  Like a really, really special forward who can guard basically everybody on the
*  floor who's kind of already doing that last year.
*  So you think like for him, we've seen so many times, like superstars come into the
*  league and I'd be a potential superstars.
*  Like, look at LeBron, like that, those Cleveland teams he played on the first
*  six years where, you know, booze or leaves, and they're just trying to play
*  catch up and get dudes and Larry Hughes.
*  And they just never had the right team around him.
*  The really, the only guy in the last 25 years who walked in the perfect
*  situation was Duncan where he comes in.
*  He's got Robinson next to him.
*  He's got Popovich.
*  They got veterans and they're just immediately good.
*  And I think that that's why the Moby Duncan thing.
*  They were already really good.
*  Right.
*  They won that year, but they were a 55 win team every year.
*  So you look at Moby, like this is about as good of a situation for somebody that
*  I think has a chance to be like a top 75 guy all time.
*  I really think it's in place for him.
*  If he can stay healthy.
*  You can't come up with a better situation.
