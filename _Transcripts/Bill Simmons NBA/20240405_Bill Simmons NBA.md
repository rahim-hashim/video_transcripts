# Big Moves This Summer for the Knicks Despite Randleâ€™s Injury? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3bF-FIIdIk)
*  The New York Knicks in one way, it's a sad story because Julius
*  Randall has been ruled out out for the year.
*  On the other hand, a lot of good things have happened with the Knicks.
*  They have shed the loser of the East, the sad sack of the New York sports scene.
*  Some things have been shed.
*  Sean fantasy is here.
*  Howard Beck is here.
*  Fantasy, where are you now mentally?
*  Just walk us through what you're thinking.
*  Where are you?
*  Well, I'm sure you invited me here to say, why can't we have nice things?
*  New York is cursed.
*  Why are we so screwed?
*  And so I'm happy to say, why can't we have nice things?
*  You know, why are, why are we so screwed?
*  I don't, I genuinely don't know.
*  I mean, somebody reminded me of this in a New York sports text chain that I'm on,
*  which you can imagine is one of the most cursed places imaginable.
*  That's kind of the saddest chain in the earth.
*  It's a pay, very painful.
*  Is there a psychiatrist on the chain?
*  Yeah.
*  Is there a doctor, is Dr.
*  Melfi on that chain?
*  Is it just the direct link to hell?
*  It's like Satan is oversea.
*  He started the chat.
*  And, uh, I don't know if it was Satan or someone else in the chat said.
*  Every time someone or something comes along in this sphere of fandom that we
*  have, um, invariably it gets scuttled.
*  You know, think of Aaron Rogers going down four plays into the season.
*  Think of Breece Hall, the season before that for the Jets getting injured in the
*  first five games of the year, you know, for the Knicks, it was this very obvious
*  thing where we got this very little, very brief snapshot of what this team with
*  Julius Randall, Jalen Brunson, OG Ananobe, Josh Hart, Mitchell Robinson,
*  Isaiah Hartenstein, and Dante DiVincenzo could be.
*  And we saw it for two games, three games after the OG acquisition.
*  And it kind of looked like maybe a championship contending team.
*  And it's easy to say that because it's a small sample size.
*  We don't really know what they were.
*  But, uh, I remember I was watching the game when Randall got hurt and, and, uh,
*  dislocated his shoulder and you could tell immediately that it was a very
*  bad injury and it feels like something has been ripped away from us.
*  And now all of a sudden we're in what if territory with the Knicks, which I guess
*  is better than what never, right?
*  It's it's it could be worse.
*  Well, you've had seven postseason appearances since the 2000 finals and
*  you've made the second round twice.
*  So even the hope, I guess Howard, like the bet, if you're going to go spin a
*  positive glass half full, they made a lot of good moves that worked, right?
*  DiVincenzo good signing.
*  Uh, Jalen Brunson, the best signing of the decade.
*  Isaiah Hartenstein, probably the best bargain free agent signing of the last
*  couple of years and they got him for under 10 million a year.
*  The Josh Hart trade was good.
*  They in an OB trade on paper.
*  I, we can talk about his health stuff in a little bit, but that was a good move.
*  Um, for the most part, it looks like a train heading in the right direction.
*  They didn't panic.
*  They didn't do the, oh my God, where the mad ish be a new owner syndrome move.
*  They still have all their picks.
*  The Celtics were probably winning the East no matter what happened with the talent
*  they have, unless somebody gets hurt in the Celtics.
*  So this probably wasn't there anyway.
*  And they're still positioned for a whole bunch of good things.
*  I would say this is positive.
*  You're going to these games in New York.
*  Does it feel positive there?
*  What's the vibe?
*  Uh, haven't been in a couple of weeks.
*  We'll be heading there when we finish up here today to see them play the Kings.
*  But listen, the vibes and shock and shock, you correct me from the
*  Unix fan perspective, if I'm wrong.
*  I think the vibes are still generally positive and even the Randall news today.
*  You kind of knew this was coming.
*  Like you could kind of see this coming.
*  You know, I don't know that anybody really expected he was going to be back.
*  Will Anna Noby be back for the playoffs?
*  We'll see.
*  Uh, but I think given everything that the Knicks as a franchise have been through
*  and put frankly, put themselves through and that Knicks fans have been put through.
*  I think you cannot look at this through any lens other than a positive one,
*  because the injuries are the injuries.
*  That that's going to happen.
*  No matter what you do.
*  I think as a baseline, anything that Knicks fans could truly ask for was just
*  operate like a normal competent team.
*  And they've done that ever since Leon Rose took that job.
*  And I, and I will say outright, like I was a bit skeptical, not because of
*  anything to do with Leon, but just the fact that I've always, I'm always
*  skeptical when someone comes in from the alternate route, right?
*  No assistant GM, no basketball ops experience period.
*  But he hired a lot of really good people, people who did have a
*  lot of front office experience.
*  Um, and they've just done the slow and steady thing, right?
*  They've, they've kept their picks.
*  They've acquired picks.
*  They haven't swung for the fences.
*  They were in the Donovan Mitchell thing, but whatever they pulled out or Utah
*  pivoted, whatever it was, they didn't overpay to get Mitchell, which turns
*  out to be the best move anyway, because he and Brunson, you and I, I think agree
*  on this bill, he and Brunson, I don't think we're ever going to be a good pairing.
*  And so they've kept their powder dry.
*  The Ananoby trade was a great move.
*  Knicks fans who are friends of mine.
*  I was always on text chains that, that day with people who were saying like
*  they were heartbroken because they love Emmanuel quickly and they
*  still had hopes for Barrett.
*  Um, but Ananoby launches them to one of their best Tommy Beer who's, uh, here
*  in town writes for a number of outlets, uh, noted this on Twitter earlier that
*  the January three week stretch with Ananoby was the Knicks best three week
*  stretch since Linsanity.
*  Uh, is that true?
*  I didn't look up the numbers.
*  I think it was like 12 and one or something, but like, like arguably the
*  most exciting and the most optimistic too since then.
*  So like, I think, you know, whatever happens in the playoffs and granted at a
*  certain point there within the last couple of months, I think again, friends
*  of mine who were Knicks fans were seeing like, Hey, if things break right, you
*  know, I think we can actually take the Celtics and I was hearing this kind of
*  chatter like they were, they were upward.
*  They were feeling we were a little concerned on the Celtics side too.
*  You were worried.
*  I remember.
*  Yeah.
*  It was the type of Miami heat type of weird, gritty, tough team that I think
*  would have given the Celtics problems.
*  Yeah.
*  And now I don't think that that's in the cards for this post season, but you,
*  you know, you've got to take, it's easy for me to say as the non-fan, but you
*  got to take the long view and the long view should be, they are at a really
*  great position to, even if they just got healthy and resign OG and an OB and just
*  bring back the same group, they're going to feel like a year from now they've got
*  that same punchers chance against Boston or whoever, but in the meantime, they
*  still have all those assets, all those extra draft picks, um, and, and just,
*  they're, they're in a great position to make the next move when they get the
*  opportunity to, and in this league, that's all you can ask because you don't know
*  when the next guy is available or when you can get them, you just got to put
*  yourself in a position where you have the assets to go get the guy if he's
*  available.
*  Well, they're going to have Randall at 30.3 next year coming off an injury and
*  then 32.4 player option, which I'm guessing like with the, how high the free
*  agent caps space it like next year might be his last year on this contract.
*  So that part's interesting.
*  And then Bogdanovich who's, you know, has just not been a great signing for them.
*  I, I guess I should have been able to predict that Tibbs wouldn't totally love
*  this guy because he's such a defense guy, but, uh, he has a team option at 19
*  next year.
*  So they have some, some chips.
*  Sean, if let's say they traded everything and they got Donovan Mitchell next year,
*  are you excited about that?
*  Or you think, are you feeling like, Oh my God, this is a classic mid 2000s
*  Knicks move?
*  Oh, I don't think it would be that bad.
*  I mean, I still think, I still think Donovan, Donovan Mitchell's in his prime
*  and is one of the most dynamic scorers in the NBA and that stretch that the calves
*  had earlier this year where he was carrying them was kind of amazing.
*  Uh, he's also just a, a dyed in the wool, New York guy who's basically desperately
*  wanted to be on the Knicks and there's a homecoming thing that hopefully doesn't
*  too closely mirror the Carmelo thing.
*  I'm the biggest Carmelo hater skeptic around.
*  And, um, I don't, I'm, I'm a little nervous about that, but I'm also enticed by it.
*  I just have the same concerns that I think any reasonable person does about
*  putting Mitchell and Brunson in the same backcourt and just feeling like, even
*  with a strategically aligned Tibbs, uh, defense, whether or not those two can
*  survive together and nobody wants to mess with Brunson.
*  I mean, Brunson is, he is already the most legendary and beloved Nick since
*  Patrick Ewing.
*  There's just no question about it.
*  I mean, he is a, I genuinely think like a, uh, a demigod to Nick's fans right now.
*  I love watching him play.
*  Everyone feels very emotionally connected to him.
*  So the idea of like messing with that somehow, or they're like him pairing him
*  with someone who reveals more of his weaknesses or whatever that might lead to.
*  Makes you feel complicated, but they have to do something because they, the
*  offense that it is they're missing without Randall is so apparent on a
*  night to night basis.
*  Dante DiVincenzo being their leading score in like six of the last 10 games.
*  They're 16 and 14 since Randall got hurt.
*  Like there's just no way around that.
*  Like they are missing him.
*  I have been flummoxed by Julius Randall since he got here.
*  He's really hard to root for.
*  He plays hard and he is obviously very gifted, but his energy and his meltdowns
*  at the wrong times, especially at the close of games drive fans nuts, but
*  they're, they're just missing something without him.
*  So whether it's him coming back in full health or making some sort of move, I
*  wonder if when you look at the core of the team now and you're like, okay, so
*  it's Brunson, DiVincenzo, Hart, Robinson, Hartenstein, Deuce McBride.
*  OG.
*  And OG, let's say they extend OG.
*  Can you get your head around Kat for Randall at that point?
*  Like can you, and picks, like can you, does it actually make more sense?
*  And then line those guys up.
*  Cause then all those guys are all 27 basically.
*  See, I don't think, as much as I like Kat, I don't think Kat would be the guy.
*  I just think Bridges is now sitting there from a Brooklyn standpoint, you know, and
*  and the Villanova thing, there's been hints.
*  Howard, you know this, follow the smoke signals, smoke signals, start pumping up
*  in the air, like what's that?
*  All right.
*  I, I see a little circle.
*  What is that?
*  And you know, the Villanova thing, which I think all of these guys love, and he
*  just feels like the last piece.
*  And if you're Brooklyn, I just, it doesn't make sense to keep him.
*  It doesn't make sense to do whatever, you know, I'm sure.
*  Have you gone to more Nets games or Knicks games this year, Howard?
*  By far Nets games, because I'm right down the street from, from Barclays Center.
*  So it's just easier.
*  I mean, is there a sadder atmosphere in the league right now than Nets games?
*  It's the worst, right?
*  The, the, they had no fans to begin with, and now everybody just
*  goes to see the other team.
*  The Nets don't like playing with each other.
*  Bridges has been exposed as, Oh, you know what?
*  He's actually not the guy who averaged 26 a game the last six
*  weeks of the season after the trade.
*  Like he's an awesome guy to have on your team in your top four, but he's not
*  like a lead guy, so I just don't know why the Nets wouldn't cash that in.
*  I actually think he's worth the most of the Knicks.
*  I'm trying to remember.
*  Howard, do you think that the Nets and Knicks would do a deal?
*  See, that's a really good question, Sean.
*  And I, if I had thought ahead on this and done my homework, I would have Googled it.
*  I think they last made a trade like 40 years ago.
*  Like Michael Ray Richardson for-
*  Yes.
*  That's why I ask.
*  It never happens.
*  It never happens.
*  It would be weird.
*  I don't think it's out of the question if, listen, I think both of these
*  front offices are pretty pragmatic and it's not like these are like, you know,
*  died in the world Knicks and Nets people, right?
*  Leon was a CIA agent for a zillion years and Sean Marks is a, you know, I still
*  think of him as a Spurs guy, frankly.
*  I don't know that they would have any like emotional or weird, awkward
*  feelings about making a deal.
*  I do wonder if the two owners might.
*  Joe Tsai and James Dolan.
*  Who knows how to predict anything that James Dolan would think or feel.
*  But I agree with you, Bill, on the broader premise anyway.
*  I think we discussed this when I was on, back in January, we were doing some,
*  some fake trade stuff, or maybe I texted it to you.
*  I thought the Nets should have traded or entertaining Mikhail
*  Bridges trades at the trade deadline.
*  Yeah, we talked about it.
*  Yeah.
*  He's, he's, he's mid prime or he's early prime 27, 28 year range, right?
*  By the time you're good again as the Nets, I know you want him there as the anchor
*  to attract, whether it's Donovan Mitchell or somebody else who can be the main guy
*  and, and, and Bridges can go back to being that number two or number three guy.
*  And he's a guy you want to play with.
*  Great.
*  That's great.
*  The problem is you don't know when you're getting that guy.
*  Maybe it happens this summer, but if it doesn't, how long are you holding on to
*  him waiting for that guy?
*  And by that time Bridges has burned a couple of years of his prime.
*  And while I'm not projecting this out, I'm just going to say, I'm going to
*  projecting this on him or expecting it or saying he should.
*  We know how it is in today's NBA.
*  You get somewhere for a while, especially if you're, you know, all star level or
*  even a little tier below that as Bridges might be, you get understandably antsy
*  and you say, guys, what are we doing?
*  Maybe I shouldn't be here.
*  Maybe it's time to deal me.
*  And I think he's got two years.
*  Kind of was sniffing that out this year a couple of times.
*  He didn't fully say it, but it's a little like, eh, what are we doing guys?
*  If I'm the nets, you got Simmons next year as an expiring.
*  So next year is screwed too.
*  I, yeah.
*  Could you talk, could you talk yourself into overpaying for Mitchell?
*  If Mitchell's like, I want to be in New York so badly that I'll even play for the
*  nets capital.
*  Yeah.
*  So you're trading all your draft capital, but now this is your team.
*  Your team is Donovan Mitchell.
*  Simmons probably has to be in that trade and then Bridges and, you know, I still
*  don't see where you are in the East.
*  I'm not, he's in a worse situation than he's in Cleveland.
*  His teammates in Cleveland are much better than his teammates would be in Brooklyn.
*  And if he feels like he can't go to the nets, I mean, out of the next, then maybe,
*  maybe that's when Miami becomes a possibility for him.
*  See, I, when I think about the next big picture, I think of bridges and I think
*  of Booker and I know, oh yeah, Booker's never leaving Phoenix.
*  I just don't believe people are in the same place ever in the NBA anymore.
*  We've been burned so many different times.
*  And if I'm the next, who's going to be unhappy.
*  And April, because we have so many good teams now, there's going to be a couple
*  of teams that are just like, holy shit.
*  We just lost in the first round in five games or, oh my God, we didn't even get
*  out of the plan.
*  We just spent $250 million on our roster.
*  And I think Phoenix is a good candidate for that.
*  If it's, it already seems kind of unhappy when you watch them.
*  Like I thought that Phoenix Cleveland game last night was like, it was like the,
*  uh, the unhappy all-star game at various times.
*  I was worried about the state of mind to both teams, but you know, and then there's
*  the Durant piece too, which we have to mention Sean.
*  You just have to, cause he does that, that interview podcast with Rich Climon,
*  which I thought was hilarious to do a podcast with your manager.
*  But, and he's like, I told you we should have done the next and Katie's like, I
*  know you were right.
*  And I'm like, all right.
*  So now the door is open now for the Knicks that they're just even talking about that.
*  And I just wonder like, if the Sun's thing goes badly this year, did the
*  Knicks come to the rescue?
*  That would be bittersweet for me because I love Kevin Durant, watching Kevin
*  Durant and just my favorite score in the last 15 years in the NBA.
*  And it was the same attitude that I had towards Aaron Rogers.
*  Uh, it was my favorite quarterback to watch and kind of like my ideal as a
*  quarterback in many ways, doesn't make mistakes.
*  Cannon arm, great improviser, cerebral.
*  Good podcast guest.
*  Absolutely.
*  Both of those guys, great podcast.
*  A lot of interesting ideas that they're sharing.
*  Thinker.
*  Complicated ideas.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  Not afraid to go against the grain.
*  Zags.
*  No, I mean, both of those guys are kind of dipshits.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like, and they're both coming to us late in their careers.
*  Like, what are we talking about?
*  Like I, what I want as an, as a fan.
*  And I think in some ways I feel this way about Jalen Brunson and maybe I'll
*  feel this way about Garrett Wilson.
*  Maybe I'll feel this way about a handful of other people.
*  When you're, I just want somebody who's 26 and the best player in the league.
*  One time in my life, just one time.
*  That would be amazing to have, you know, to, to draft Kevin Durant, not to get
*  Kevin Durant when he's 37 on his whoops.
*  I screwed up four years ago and went to Brooklyn contract and begging his way
*  out of the Matt Ishby, uh, tire fire owner syndrome, Phoenix suns, like,
*  that just doesn't make sense.
*  It doesn't make sense for the culture that Tibbs and Rose built that Howard
*  was talking about.
*  I don't even know what, what is Durant searching for?
*  Like a kind of vindication there.
*  Like what could complicate his legacy even more than trying to make the, like
*  make up for the mistake that he made by not coming in the first place, then
*  coming late and then letting us down and then not working out.
*  That would only, that that's the only thing you could do to make it
*  worse for fan, for Nick's fans.
*  So I don't know.
*  Booker might actually be slightly more realistic if he decided he just didn't
*  want to be there anymore, which we've seen over and over again in the NBA for
*  the last 20 years, but he's got all the Kentucky ties and all the ties with
*  West and those guys.
*  And I think that's on the short list for them.
*  They, that's the one they've been waiting for forever.
*  And he's what I'm talking about.
*  He's 27.
*  He's one of the 10 best players in the league.
*  He's a dog and he would be a megastar in New York.
*  May it makes a little more sense with Brunson, right?
*  Yeah.
*  He's bigger.
*  You know, he can defend wings.
*  Like there's more there that makes sense than Mitchell.
*  Um, I don't know though.
*  I don't, in what world are you trading Devin Booker?
*  How can you trade?
*  Like he would have to, he would have to say, like I went out, but that's brings me
*  to the point I had earlier, which is like, we're going to have some unhappiness in
*  April.
*  Like this is just the way it's going to go.
*  There's going to be five or six teams who are just at the, at the crossroads
*  and players that are going, Oh my God, I just wasted a year of my career and, and
*  you know, we want to play in game and then I lost in five and round one.
*  What's what, what's next?
*  What are we going to do?
*  How are we going to get better?
*  And there's going to be no answers.
*  The league's just really, really good.
*  Howard, do you, are you surprised that the Knicks are even in the position where
*  they could potentially lure, they can big game hunt again?
*  Cause this was so bad.
*  Guys weren't even taking free agent meetings with this organization anymore.
*  Like, did you ever feel like this was irretrievable if Dolan was the owner or
*  there, there was some path back?
*  I mean, there was certainly the case to be made that it might be
*  irretrievable with Dolan as the owner, with all the missteps he's made
*  privately, publicly, operationally, politically, all kinds of different
*  things you could throw into that bucket.
*  But I've also, you know, been covered the league long enough to know that like,
*  nothing's permanent in this league, right?
*  You know, the Clippers were the laughing stock for most of our lives, right?
*  And they're about to move into their own beautiful new building.
*  They've got a great owner who's the richest owner in the NBA, maybe
*  the richest owner in sports.
*  Um, and they're respectful.
*  They have James Harden.
*  He's red hot right now.
*  That's going great.
*  I mean, things happen, but you know, um, but no, but like, listen, Bill,
*  I think we would agree if those guys all retired tomorrow, the difference is
*  that by Kawhi and Paul George picking the Clippers and then Harden going Westbrook,
*  whoever, it's changed the image of them.
*  If they have cap room tomorrow, guys are going to actually consider them.
*  The best players will consider them in the way that they never would have during
*  the entirety of the Donald Sterling era.
*  So, you know, things change quickly.
*  Um, I'm only surprised that the Knicks are in this position based on what I said
*  earlier, which is that at the time that Leon Rose comes in with worldwide West
*  and everything else, it's like, what, what exactly are they doing here?
*  Like, yo, Dolan's always hiring the guy who he thinks, um, you know, can, can
*  somehow get him the stars immediately.
*  And that, and that hasn't even really happened.
*  The one guy who's become the star is Jalen Brunson, who at the time they
*  signed him, people thought was an overpay and that was a vast underpay.
*  Oh my God.
*  So it's the, the surprise in it is simply that they took a very
*  unconventional road to get here.
*  And the front office has operated in a way that I think most of their
*  predecessors in New York have not.
*  They've, they've done the smart, pragmatic, methodical type of moves,
*  smaller moves, singles and doubles, instead of it all being swing for the
*  fences every time, instead of it being, you know, let's go get Marbury, let's
*  get Amari Stoudemire, let's get Carmelo and trade everything we've got to get
*  him and now hamstring the Carmelo era for the rest of time, because we
*  had no assets left to deal.
*  They were always sending out everything they had to get somebody and often the
*  wrong guy at the wrong time.
*  Um, and that's what they have not done.
*  Patient.
*  So now, now you have Sean dreaming about Booker and towns.
*  And one thing that happened that I talked about a couple of times in my podcast
*  during the off season last year about the honest side of things and how one of
*  the bucks owners sold.
*  And, and I just thought there was some, some things I just didn't like coming
*  out.
*  Let's go, Billy.
*  Let's do it.
*  Come on.
*  Come to New York.
*  The, the more now cause he's, he locked into Milwaukee at least for a little
*  while, but the, the more I've heard afterwards, after the fact, I think the
*  bucks thought like he was going to ask for a trade.
*  I really think that was in play before the season.
*  And then when they did the Dame trade and then all of a sudden Yannis came back
*  in, I forget which one happened first, but there was a little stretch there where
*  they were like, he's not going to opt in and we're probably going to have to trade
*  him or we're going to lose him for nothing.
*  And I think the Knicks were sitting there for that.
*  Yannis gave two interviews last summer, one with the New York times and one with
*  a podcast whose name I apologize.
*  I cannot remember where he basically said, like, if we're not going to be able
*  to compete for championships, then yeah, maybe I would go somewhere else.
*  I'm paraphrasing, obviously, but he was, he was, he was laying the breadcrumbs,
*  but I think in real life, I think the situation was way more advanced and you
*  know, and then what would ever happen happened and they stayed, but even like
*  the Griffin to dock thing, I think they're, I think they're always going to be
*  concerned.
*  He's just going to look up one day and be like, eh, it's time.
*  I've outgrown this place, you know, which we've seen happen a lot in the NBA.
*  So I wonder like, like, I do think the Knicks are hoarding their assets.
*  They're waiting.
*  I'm going to be really interested in the Inunobi contract though, because I have
*  it written down.
*  Let's just say he's not Lou Gehrig from a durability standpoint.
*  Um, last four years, 29 games missed, 34 games missed 15 games missed this year,
*  31 and counting.
*  And I don't even know what's going on with that elbow and why it's like, why
*  it's not getting better, but, um, I just don't know.
*  There's always some wink wink stuff with this.
*  What, how high does that contract go Sean, before you start throwing up in a
*  garbage can like four years, four years, one 20.
*  Are you throwing up yet?
*  Like four years, one 40.
*  Where are we going?
*  Four years, one 60.
*  Are you puking?
*  That's that's, that would be not good.
*  Four years, one 60 would be not good.
*  I'm, I'm, I'm concerned.
*  I mean, on the one hand, like he's going to be 27 this summer when he played.
*  Um, he was, he's like the ultimate Tibbs weapon.
*  He's like the player that I imagine Tibbs has been dreaming of his entire career.
*  Guy who can hit open threes and defend every position on the floor.
*  And he completely unlocked their ability as, you know, they lost, I think they
*  went like 16 and two in January.
*  They were the remarkable.
*  Um, but if he has a chronic injury, that's the kind of move that can like
*  literally derail a five year period for a team.
*  I mean, if they're paying him for $40 million.
*  Go look at Ben Simmons.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it can be a disastrous move.
*  So I don't know.
*  I mean, I, they have to just make sure that they have the right information about
*  his health because you know, you'd imagine that if he was healthy enough to play
*  right now, he'd be playing.
*  I, I guess maybe you could make the case that they knew deep down that Randall was
*  never coming back.
*  So they're not trying to push it with OG and that there's a quiet acceptance.
*  That's fair that this is not the year.
*  And so let him heal fully before giving him that extension.
*  I don't know.
*  That's trying to psychologize the front office there.
*  I am a little nervous about the contract though.
*  It was also the weirdness of someone like OG making 10 or $15 million more a year
*  than Jalen Brunson, which will get resolved in the next year or two when he gets
*  extended.
*  But that also is kind of strange for a guy who, you know, OG is a three.
*  He's a number.
*  He's like a number three piece on a great team, not a number two, not a number
*  four.
*  He's a three and $40 million is a lot for that.
*  If Brunson makes all NBA, does he get it?
*  Uh, what happens to his contract?
*  I know I don't know the rule cause he signed a couple of years ago, but like for
*  me, I was, and I've been tinkering with my own VA every week now.
*  We're still seven games away.
*  There's some things in flux, but I don't really see a scenario where he's not a
*  second team on NBA guy for me now.
*  I think he's probably a lock.
*  And I think, and listen, I have not done the exercise yet.
*  Bill, you're ahead of, you're ahead of me.
*  I got to get my shit together, but like it's, it's hard to imagine that he's not
*  going to make one of the all NBA teams.
*  Um, and especially because we're in the first year of this, this whole 65 game
*  rule, which is going to knock out a bunch of other guys, not that Mitchell already.
*  And we're in the first year of it being positioned this too, which I know, Bill,
*  you're still going to go, you've said you're going to go with positions and I'm
*  considering that myself too.
*  I'm a little uncomfortable with it just being one through 15.
*  But the thing about the one through 15 is if you want to over index forwards or
*  bigs, you can, and that could come at the expense of some guards.
*  Does that mean to somebody like Brunson falls off?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't, I'm not saying he should.
*  He has to be in the, he has to be second on.
*  He absolutely has to be.
*  Um, I don't know.
*  I do not have my, my, uh, my Bobby Marks hat on today.
*  I do not know where that, with that,
*  funny Bobby just came barging into the pod.
*  I don't know where he just like, like a bat signal.
*  Sean, what do you think the, uh, the net rating is of the heart and sign
*  heart Brunson, D Finchenzo, Deuce McBride lineup?
*  If you had to guess,
*  you're going to have to tell me it's plus 32.4 per a hundred minutes.
*  It's a hard foundation.
*  That's what was, was trying to get that going on the ringer MBA show, the
*  heart foundation, Hardenstein and, uh,
*  and Josh Hart and Josh Hart.
*  I, to me, even gentle has been the story.
*  I mean, he's had multiple games now where he's made eight plus three pointers.
*  There's something crazy going on.
*  Right now.
*  He was not this good on the words last year, but not even close.
*  I mean, I, I think there's, I have heard some people say that there's some
*  confusion around the success of this team because basically every player is
*  having a career year and if every player has a career year, do you want to
*  overextend your excitement or is it just that these guys have hit their prime
*  and that this is who they are?
*  You know, maybe Dante DiVincenzo is a 40% three point shooter who shoots 12 threes
*  a game.
*  Maybe that is his game now.
*  I don't, I don't, I really don't know.
*  It's impossible to tell though, when Randall and OG don't play because like
*  what actually are those other guys who were 25 minute a night guys who are now
*  35 minute a night guys, it's really hard to say.
*  Yeah.
*  The analytics guys will tell you that three point shootings, one of those
*  things where if you have suddenly a career, like there was, uh, I hate to
*  bring this up for Sean's sake, but like Raymond Felton and maybe JR Smith, that
*  same year, the 54 win season, like some guys had career years or like outstanding
*  three months stretches and the analytics guys will tell you like three point
*  shooting, if you have like an, uh, an outlier year, especially, you know, to,
*  to the high end way over your career average, that's probably the anomaly.
*  It doesn't necessarily mean it's a, it's a, it takes a while to stabilize.
*  And so it's not necessarily a permanent state of affairs.
*  And so, yeah, I think there should be at least a little bit of concern about too
*  many guys having career years is that they're all hitting their prime at the
*  same time, is that they're playing with Jalen Brunson, is it that it's just a
*  chemistry thing?
*  Is it just the universe?
*  Everything clicked into place.
*  And if you overpay everyone and assume you're going to, this is just going to
*  keep climbing that that could be a little scary.
*  Can I give you what my biggest concern would be?
*  Cause we lived in Boston with the Isaiah Thomas year.
*  Rossella brought this up on Sunday's pod.
*  Isaiah Thomas had a very similar year to what Brunson's doing this year, where
*  he was just awesome and actually running a lot of the same offensive sets that
*  the Celtics ran that year that the Dixon were in this year.
*  And, um, just took a physical pounding night after night, after night, after
*  night, and, um, couldn't sustain it.
*  Got hurt.
*  And when I watched Brunson, I think the thing that is one of the reasons I can't
*  wait to put them on my second team is, uh, just the, the pounding he takes night
*  after night, fucking love that guy, man.
*  He really like, he really leaves it all out, especially when they changed
*  the rules in February, there were some guys like that.
*  It was just worse for, I think it was bad for Curry.
*  It was bad for Brunson.
*  Some of these guys that you can really kind of rough up, especially the smaller
*  guards, um, that guy keeps ticking.
*  I thought that, uh, that San Antonio game when, what did he end up with?
*  61?
*  Yeah.
*  And he only had six free throws.
*  And I, there was like 10 different times he went flying into something, but I, I
*  think, but it's not surprising to me to hear that you think he's the most popular.
*  Nixon's Ewing.
*  But it speaks to like a challenge that that team is having right now.
*  Cause now two of their last three losses have come down to the last possession
*  and Brunson has taken the final shot in both games and he's been unbelievable
*  in both games, but he's freaking exhausted playing 44 minutes a game.
*  And he's taking, you know, off balance shots with not a lot of
*  offensive help missing guys.
*  And what's he supposed to do?
*  The Isaiah Thomas thing is a little scary to me because Isaiah Thomas, like,
*  when you look back, basically had those two mega seasons with the Celtics
*  where he was amazing.
*  I don't think we're going to look back on Brunson is having these two
*  incredible seasons with the Knicks and then breaking down.
*  I guess it's possible.
*  We have to account for it.
*  They're built a little bit differently and they play a little bit differently
*  to me, Brunson and Thomas.
*  Thomas is a little bit more slight, I think, than Brunson.
*  I mean, he's probably five foot nine.
*  Yeah.
*  Brunson is five nine.
*  Yeah.
*  Brunson's listed at six two, but his, his own teammates say he's closer to six.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But he just, he felt, I felt a little bit like stiffer and sturdier to me too.
*  Uh, Brunson.
*  Well, either way, Sean's back.
*  I remember there was a time in the mid 2010s when he thought about
*  giving up the NBA entirely.
*  I, I, I never in a million years would have thought, as Howard said, that it
*  would have been Leon Rosen and Tibbs who would have gotten me back into, I was
*  very dubious that the Tibbs hire.
*  I was miserable when they failed to sign Durant.
*  Miserable.
*  That might've been my lowest because I thought that that was their best chance
*  to get that credibility back.
*  And I was a hundred percent wrong about that.
*  They have done an amazing job rebuilding this team and never made a mistake.
*  But now we're at this summer.
*  This could be the time when you make the mistakes, but I really hope they don't.
*  All right.
*  Sean fantasy can listen to him on the big picture and on the rewatchable
*  is every once in a while.
*  And sometimes he goes on the New York, New York podcast with John
*  Justremski usually, usually unhappily.
*  Metz or 0 and 5.
*  We got to put you in a situation when you're popping on sports
*  podcasts and a happy mood.
