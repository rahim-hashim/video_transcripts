# Favorite NBA Training Camp Storylines With Rob Mahoney  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLn728UA4WM)
*  All right, we're taping this on a Tuesday afternoon.
*  This is a guy who got ready for training camp
*  by losing at least 25 to 30 pounds.
*  Oh no, that was Joel Embiid.
*  But it is Rob Bohony.
*  How are you, Rob?
*  I'm good.
*  You know, Joel and I get confused very often.
*  So I'll forgive the error just this once.
*  25 to 30 pounds.
*  What's the exact number for Joel?
*  Three and a half.
*  We'll see.
*  He said he's still working on it.
*  He doesn't care.
*  We're gonna talk about this
*  when we do training camp storylines.
*  So you covered this on your pod before.
*  I covered it on my pod.
*  You covered it with the big towns trade,
*  which is not official yet.
*  And I think when it happened,
*  everybody has their reactions.
*  I certainly had mine.
*  Now we've had a chance for it to sink in for a few days.
*  Has anything changed in your head since this trade happened?
*  I think I keep coming back to,
*  and maybe this is my personal risk aversion talking,
*  and we can get into that if you want to,
*  but I find it harder putting myself
*  in the place of a contending team to think,
*  wouldn't it be cool if we just dramatically
*  reconfigure everything that we do?
*  And I say that for both sides of this deal.
*  I think the Wolves were in pretty good position
*  to contend in the West.
*  I thought the Knicks with McHale Bridges
*  were sitting in a pretty favorable position in the East,
*  at least to make another deep run.
*  And so for both of those teams to look at their situations,
*  and granted there are flaws there,
*  but say we wanna shake this up dramatically,
*  I just don't know that I would have gotten there
*  coming into the season.
*  Maybe at the deadline,
*  maybe deeper in once you saw a little bit more
*  of what you've got,
*  I don't know that I was ready to make a move
*  this big on either side.
*  Yeah, the more distance I got from it,
*  it just seems to me it's about flexibility,
*  where you have a Minnesota team
*  that just could not sustain the financial model
*  of whatever that team was gonna be, right?
*  And they felt like we actually have it out
*  to get two players and contend this year
*  and have some flexibility going forward,
*  and we're not trapped to those next three towns years
*  where our model just goes sideways.
*  I get it.
*  And I probably am now leaning toward liking the trade
*  a little bit more for them,
*  because there's a world where Randall comes in
*  and goes great.
*  From the Knicks standpoint,
*  the more I stare at it,
*  it just seems like we need a center.
*  Let's push all the chips in.
*  We're getting the best guy in the trade.
*  And most important,
*  and I wish I had made this point harder on Saturday,
*  we just don't wanna give Randall that extension.
*  And we think it's gonna be a problem
*  that we're not giving the extension.
*  I think, I talked about chemistry stuff on Saturday,
*  and I wish I'd hit the extension part harder,
*  because going into a season
*  where he's gonna have to sacrifice,
*  and then also not know what he's getting paid,
*  and then also not know what his role is,
*  and then also not know if he's gonna finish every game,
*  and there might be situations where he's just on the bench
*  for the last five minutes,
*  and be in a situation where it's him and the Nova Knicks,
*  or everybody that the Knicks loves.
*  I think they just sniffed it out
*  and didn't like where that was headed.
*  And at least with Townes, throw out this year,
*  so it's a three-year commitment after this.
*  It's a guy they all knew, it's a CAA guy,
*  it's a Kentucky guy, and they're just making the bet.
*  But there's no way they felt 100% on it, I don't think.
*  I don't think either team can feel 100%,
*  but I wanna focus on the Randall part of this,
*  because you said you can see the vision
*  of how this could go well for Minnesota,
*  if everything works right for Randall.
*  But everything you just said about his extension
*  also applies to their financial situation.
*  Either they're in bed with Julius Randall
*  for the foreseeable future,
*  or he is a very short-term piece of this team.
*  And I think that's where I get caught up
*  on the cat element is, the finances were what they were,
*  and it was always gonna be more likely
*  that they would trade him at some point,
*  or trade some big financial piece at some point,
*  then keep this whole group together.
*  That just, the writing was kind of on the wall,
*  it was just a matter of timing and who.
*  But if all you're getting back for cat is a first,
*  and Genzo, a player we all like,
*  and maybe or maybe not the future of Julius Randall,
*  at a price point you may or may not actually like,
*  why are we doing that?
*  Why are we doing that when we have a ready-made
*  conference finals worthy team?
*  Maybe it doesn't get all the way there this year,
*  but certainly worthy of competing at that level.
*  It's a great question.
*  And I think maybe they look at it from their end and say,
*  if this starts to slide backwards, what are our outs?
*  And ironically, they were in the same position
*  that the Knicks are in now.
*  The glass half empty version of this, what are our outs?
*  And for Minnesota, they would have had no outs
*  at that point, right?
*  You probably, there's a Go Bear extension
*  that they probably would have passed on,
*  and maybe they'll pass on it anyway.
*  We have no chance to trade towns now.
*  This is our one chance to get two guys
*  plus a little more flexibility, and maybe that's gone.
*  I also think they could probably quietly shop him
*  around a little bit and have at least a little bit
*  of a sense for what these guys are worth,
*  but it speaks to another NBA piece of this,
*  which are these high-priced, non-alpha superstars,
*  not maybe all NBA, but not quite Bradley Beal,
*  Zaco Vein, but it feels like there's more of those.
*  Because the Ingram thing, I think, was the most fascinating
*  one to me all summer.
*  Nobody wanted them.
*  And I did Ringer 100, which you did too.
*  You did the votes.
*  Ingram's somewhere between,
*  you could put him as high as high 40s,
*  you could put him low 60s, but he's one of the best,
*  probably 60 players in the league,
*  and he was at 36 million, I think,
*  or 35 million for one more year,
*  and everybody was like, pass.
*  Yeah, and another extension debacle too.
*  Another guy who the Pelicans just aren't looking
*  at that future and saying, we see how he fits
*  with what we have and with the direction that we're going.
*  And the problem with Brandon Ingram is,
*  I think it's hard for a lot of teams to envision
*  exactly what that is because of the class of player he is,
*  and because of what his strengths are,
*  which is somebody who is ultimately a lot more comfortable
*  with the ball in his hands,
*  but has not shown that he can elevate a team
*  into great standing and great postseason success
*  with that kind of responsibility.
*  Right, and the Warriors looked at it and said no thanks.
*  Yes.
*  When they desperately wanted to make a move
*  and pursued Laurie Markin in it all summer.
*  Towns is more interesting because I think Towns is somebody,
*  first of all, Towns is good.
*  I mean, I had him in my top 35, I'm sure you did too.
*  He's somewhere in the 25, 35 Rangers.
*  No, I think I had him like 32.
*  He's somebody you can really talk yourself into
*  as a shooting stretch five.
*  Same way the Celtics talked themselves into Porzingis.
*  But the price for Porzingis was ironically
*  a little similar to the Towns price.
*  And Minnesota got more for Towns,
*  but same thing where it's like, man,
*  that's all they got for Towns, but super expensive guy.
*  He's missed a bunch of games last five years.
*  There's real questions about the self-awareness with him,
*  which I think are gonna be tested
*  to the gills in New York City.
*  It's interesting to hear all the different takes on that too.
*  Because I think everybody likes him.
*  But I think everybody has the same concerns
*  about him in New York City.
*  And there's two types of people
*  that seem to just fail in New York City.
*  And one of those two types is I am not self-aware at all
*  and I just say things that then become dissected
*  and ridiculed for two straight days
*  and maybe I shouldn't have said that.
*  He was always a maybe I shouldn't have said that guy.
*  And now he's going in the worst city to be a maybe
*  I shouldn't have said that guy.
*  That part of it I think is gonna be tough.
*  The even just kind of figuring out how he fits
*  and finds his place in things basketball wise
*  will be interesting for him.
*  Because he is a guy who by the nature of his skill set,
*  and this is true of any kind of stretch big,
*  you have to pick your spots very carefully.
*  And I thought that's where the Porzingis story
*  panned out so successfully for Boston
*  as they knew exactly these are the matchups
*  where you put him at the elbow and he goes to work.
*  These are the situations where he's just spacing.
*  This is when he could get away with rolling
*  all that was very carefully laid out.
*  It's a tricky thing to manage.
*  And I think this is where the Nova Knicks thing
*  could potentially be more than a cute story.
*  The Knicks have a lot that they need to incorporate now
*  with Kat and Bridges and a reshuffled bench.
*  And before we forget, OJ and Anovius
*  played like 30 games with the Knicks.
*  Right.
*  If some of these guys already have the baked in familiarity
*  of going through a postseason run together,
*  and even Bridges who you're bringing in
*  knows how to play with Brunson and Hart,
*  there's a continuity there of a kind
*  even if it's a little bit older in terms of the history.
*  Maybe that makes all this a little bit easier
*  in terms of okay, Bridges is a guy
*  you don't necessarily have to worry about
*  funneling a certain kind of touch to
*  or certain kind of opportunity to.
*  All of our attention coming into camp can be
*  how do we make Carl Anthony Towns comfortable
*  in the way that we play?
*  And how do we maximize what he does?
*  Because there's no question they need a creator like him.
*  I just wonder if he can be the kind of creator
*  who isn't committing two and a half offensive fouls a night,
*  who isn't taking a couple shots
*  that he shouldn't take every so often,
*  like killing the momentum of a Jalen Brunson run.
*  What was your take on Towns defensively,
*  I'm looking up his basketball reference as we're talking,
*  what was your take on his defensive abilities
*  and deficiencies before Go Bear showed up in Minnesota?
*  Did not seem super tenable as a full-time five to me.
*  But if he was gonna be tenable at any point,
*  it would probably be with someone like OGN and OB
*  next to him and probably be with another wing defender
*  like Mikhail Bridges next to him.
*  So as far as setting him up
*  for some kind of defensive success,
*  I think this is as close as you're gonna get.
*  And there's also the possibility
*  when Mitchell Robinson comes back,
*  you could play Towns at the four
*  in the way that he played next to Go Bear.
*  There's some momentum there and a style there
*  that could potentially work
*  and his shooting is certainly good enough.
*  I just don't think if Towns is your five,
*  you're gonna be an elite, elite defensive team.
*  It's more about-
*  Even with all the other guys they have.
*  I think it's a matter of managing it.
*  You're gonna be very solid,
*  probably the back part of the top 10, good defensive team.
*  They have the rebounding, they have the versatility,
*  they have the length.
*  I think what's most important for them is
*  they do match up better with the Celtics.
*  And if that is the most important matchup in the field,
*  then I think Towns does a lot for you there
*  and also a style that I think
*  fits that matchup a little better.
*  Yeah, I was thinking about,
*  I was already moving ahead to April, May.
*  Of course.
*  When we start, when the playoffs really shrinks
*  to just matchups and attacking.
*  And teams were already attacking Brunson, right?
*  It's like, how can we wear him down?
*  How can we just put him in stuff?
*  And now they're gonna be attacking him with Towns' guy.
*  And Ananobe and Bridges and Josh Hart,
*  as good as those guys are defensively,
*  I kind of feel like they're not gonna be involved
*  in a lot of playoff basketball
*  because it's gonna be all about who's Towns guarding,
*  bring him over, set the screen on Brunson's guy
*  and let's just go to Town on those two guys
*  and everybody else can kind of stay over there.
*  And teams tried to do that to Minnesota last year
*  with Towns to pretty solid success.
*  At the same time, I was impressed
*  by what he did against Jokic.
*  Now, granted he had Nazred and he had Gobert,
*  but that was about as good as I've seen him do.
*  So when Towns, when Minnesota was shitty,
*  he was basically between 17 and 18 shots a game.
*  And then the last two years, as Ant kind of ascended,
*  he was at 15 a game.
*  And then we get to the playoffs.
*  Last year and this year, that's about 14 a game.
*  And I do wonder on the Knicks,
*  how many shots are there for him?
*  Is he gonna be the second option?
*  Is it gonna be Brunson is the first option
*  and then just a hodgepodge of other guys?
*  And are they just gonna tell him,
*  here's what we want, dude.
*  Punish smaller guys in the post,
*  hit some threes, play defense, move your feet.
*  And that's what we want.
*  And grab 10, 11 rebounds.
*  That's all we want.
*  You're here, we wanted you here, we traded for you.
*  You're here for the next three years.
*  We're not gonna trade you, you're a guy.
*  But we need your help here, here and here.
*  And just do this.
*  Don't worry about scoring 25 points a game anymore.
*  Those days are over.
*  And whether he accepts that or not.
*  I think we have reason to suspect that he will.
*  For all of Katz faults,
*  he has been pretty willing to try new things.
*  And when pushes come to shove,
*  it has almost always been incumbent on him.
*  He's the one moving to the fore.
*  He is the one spacing out to begin with.
*  He is the one who has to take on a different kind of role.
*  I'm not saying he's been universally successful,
*  but look, stars are creatures of habit.
*  And there are a lot of guys in the league
*  who categorically will not change their substitution pattern
*  because they're so superstitious that like,
*  I need to come in at the eight minute mark
*  or else my whole rhythm is off.
*  And I give Katz a lot of credit for the fact that
*  he's been willing to try lots of stuff for the Wolves.
*  And for a winning team,
*  and that's absolutely what the Knicks are,
*  a team with a proven track record, with winning habits,
*  with guys who are likable and high energy
*  and you wanna play well for,
*  I think he's gonna wanna try to be on his best behavior
*  with that stuff.
*  It's funny how the Hartenstein,
*  how that became a sliding doors for this season.
*  Right? Oh, it did.
*  They made OKC the prohibitive favorite,
*  like at least for the regular season.
*  I don't know about the playoffs,
*  but I think if you're betting
*  who's gonna have the best record in the league this season,
*  they have to be the first team mentioned.
*  But then it also opens the door for the Knicks
*  to now have to go, shit, what do we do?
*  And you start looking at the available centers
*  and they just weren't there.
*  So you're occasionally a cynical guy.
*  Occasionally.
*  I try to fight it.
*  You're on the prestige TV pod a lot.
*  You're doing anti-hero shows and weird shows and dark shows.
*  A lot of dark shows in the prestige pod.
*  The Towns prestige TV season three,
*  Towns goes to New York, I think would start out great.
*  And then by episode three,
*  maybe there's a couple red herrings and uh-ohs.
*  Maybe there's a district eternity
*  having a heart attack at the end of episode five.
*  Oh, definitely.
*  It's definitely a roller coaster ride is my point.
*  The Carl Anthony Towns in New York City.
*  Ultimately, I'm rooting for him
*  the same way I would root for one of those shows,
*  even though he's on the Knicks.
*  They're pitting against the Celtics.
*  But I've always kind of liked him.
*  And I think one of the recurring themes with his career
*  is people being frustrated by him
*  because they want to like him.
*  And it's like, ah dude, why'd you say that?
*  Come on, why'd you foul that guy 40 feet from the basket?
*  It's like, come on dude.
*  Just, can you stop being you?
*  Can you just reach your potential?
*  He's, and I don't know if that's his destiny or not
*  as a player.
*  I actually want the opposite.
*  I want him to be him.
*  Because I feel like when he steps in it
*  and says the wrong thing and it's the,
*  why did you say that kind of moment,
*  it's usually because he's trying to be somebody he's not.
*  And he's speaking with like a bluster and a bravado
*  that doesn't always seem like
*  it's coming that naturally to him.
*  New York is not the easiest place
*  to be comfortable in your own skin.
*  I hope that he can find that peace somehow.
*  I hope he can find whatever his corner of the city is,
*  make it his own, stay sequestered in your neighborhood,
*  get to know your bodega.
*  I think there's a version of this that can work.
*  Like you, I really hope to see it.
*  Yeah, Boston, New York, Philly, all the East Coast cities
*  are similar in that authenticity always is gonna win
*  in any of those cities, right?
*  They're always gonna root for people who
*  just really give a shit and stay true to themselves.
*  And the guys who always seem to get in trouble
*  over and over again in any of those cities
*  are the people that talk out of their ass,
*  pretend there's something they're not,
*  take some sort of false bravado over the actual
*  accomplishments on the court.
*  And it's weird, because Embiid is probably the only one
*  who hasn't been victim of that,
*  because Philly just loves Embiid.
*  And sometimes he'll say stuff or do stuff,
*  and you're like, I can't believe the Sixers fans
*  are putting up with this.
*  But they just, they like the guy.
*  And that's it.
*  Now you're just trying to agitate.
*  Now the season hasn't even started,
*  you're just lighting little fires.
*  Well, next season is when we're agitating.
*  So Towns has played, he played 16 playoff games
*  for his entire career until last year
*  when he also played 16 playoff games.
*  32 playoff games total for him.
*  And last year he was in a really sweet spot
*  with Minnesota where Edwards was the go-to guy,
*  the defense was kind of the meal ticket,
*  and basically anything he did was a bonus.
*  Do you feel like that's the same in New York,
*  or do you think they need more than that?
*  I think they need a little bit more,
*  but I also think that the overall team
*  is set up better for him to do more,
*  and to press a little bit.
*  The spacing is gonna be a little cleaner.
*  The fact that the rest of the team
*  is so perimeter oriented,
*  I think is gonna open up room for him
*  to even just attack the offensive glass,
*  something that Tom Thibodeau historically
*  loves his teams doing.
*  And so there's gonna be a chance for him
*  to exert his impact on the game in a different way.
*  And frankly, for a cat team,
*  I think that makes more sense
*  than what we had with the Wolves,
*  where Anthony Edwards,
*  based on the spacing that Minnesota was working with,
*  had to do a lot of really high level processing
*  in order to try to get over the hump.
*  And he's just not quite, quite there yet.
*  And maybe he will be next time we see him in the playoffs.
*  The Knicks are different,
*  because Jalen Brunson does have to do some of that,
*  but all the spacing and stuff that we're talking about
*  allows Josh Hart to bust out for a meaningful game.
*  It allows Isaiah Hartenstein to bust out
*  for a meaningful game.
*  You put one of the most skilled bigs in the league
*  in that position, and Cat,
*  I don't see why he can't have a huge impact on that offense.
*  Yeah, it's weird,
*  because I'm putting myself to Cat on
*  and trying to figure out
*  if I'm more or less scared of them after this trade.
*  And I think the answer is more,
*  because they really didn't have a center.
*  The center thing, losing Hartenstein,
*  never knowing when Mitchell Robinson was gonna come back.
*  The guys that were available,
*  that might be available in January, February,
*  it just seemed like that was gonna sink them,
*  and they were basically gonna have to do
*  the small ball, Tibbs, everybody playing 42 minutes,
*  weird lineups, and try to sneak their way through.
*  And now the team makes a little more sense,
*  but man, if it doesn't work out.
*  And now the next fans don't wanna hear it.
*  They're like, well, who's making a trade?
*  You could've said that about Porzingis.
*  And it's like, yeah, but Porzingis is making 30,
*  and Towns is in the high 50s.
*  One last thing on Minnesota,
*  and then we'll wrap this part up.
*  As a league pass team,
*  I think they're gonna be one of the most interesting teams
*  in the first six weeks of the season
*  to see how all the pieces fit together, right?
*  They're gonna pass better,
*  because Randall was kind of a sneaky good passer,
*  and he would get assists and create shots for other people,
*  and Towns was never a create shots for anybody else guy.
*  Defensas way more fun to play with,
*  I think, than any swing they had.
*  So you have that stuff.
*  So, then Dillingham coming off the bench,
*  just has this crazy kind of heat check ball
*  running through him, I can carry the offense 15 minutes.
*  I'm really interested in seeing how it works.
*  What happens to Gobert coming out of the Olympics,
*  where he was basically just shoved to the side
*  and treated like he was, you know, Luke Cornette.
*  Hey, I mean, Luke Cornette probably played more.
*  But I think it's gonna be a fun team to watch,
*  and I have no idea, you could tell me
*  they're gonna be awesome, or you could tell me
*  we'll be doing What's Wrong with the Wolves segments
*  three weeks in, and I'm prepared for any scenario
*  with that, right?
*  I think it's gonna be pretty comfortably in between.
*  I don't think they're gonna be awesome out of the gate.
*  There's just too much they need to sort through first.
*  But they're too talented to be bad.
*  I don't think they're gonna flounder by any means.
*  I actually do think the Randall thing you mentioned
*  about his playmaking is gonna be really nice for them,
*  especially in some of the smaller groups,
*  or when he and Dante DiVincenzo, for example,
*  are out there together, Randall is much more of a
*  drive and spray out kind of playmaker.
*  And I will say this about Kat, he's not a great passer.
*  The one thing he did well was set up Rudy,
*  kind of like big to big lobs.
*  That's never really been Randall's playmaking style.
*  And so there's gonna be a bit of an adjustment there.
*  But I think the trade off as far as a team that is
*  positioning a rookie to basically be their backup
*  point guard right now, although I guess Anthony Edwards
*  is probably kind of the backup point guard.
*  But Rob Dillingham is gonna be an important part
*  of this team.
*  And if you can ease him in with the training wheels
*  of having a playmaking four in the mix,
*  that's gonna help.
*  I'm just having visions of Ant trying to go to work
*  and Julius Randall spotting up on the weak side
*  and teams going, yes, we will trust you to take that shot
*  as many times as you would like to take it.
*  And the Wolves are gonna walk into that and when that guy
*  isn't Kat shooting 40% from three, there are nights
*  where that really, really hurts.
*  And then you have the night where McDaniels doesn't
*  make anything, you've Go Bear out there who can't
*  make anything, so you have three of the four Ant teammates
*  have the inability to shoot.
*  But I do like that they can throw a little more flexibility
*  out with lineups now than you really felt it during
*  the Dallas series.
*  You know, like once Ant couldn't look like a reasonable
*  facsimile of MJ anymore, all of a sudden that went sideways.
*  So your final recommendation is thumbs up for the Knicks,
*  thumbs tilting a little down for the T Wolves?
*  Yeah.
*  That's where you landed?
*  I think that's fair.
*  Would I have made this move if I were the Knicks?
*  I think given the talent play, you probably have to.
*  But it does make me at least a little bit nervous.
*  I think you bet on Carl and you see if you can make it work.
*  The Wolves, I don't think I would have swung this big
*  right now.
*  What prestige TV show do you think the Knicks are gonna be
*  this year?
*  What would you go with?
*  The plot line you laid out sounded very like New York Ozark
*  to me, which is I think a much darker outcome than the Knicks
*  would like.
*  New York Ozark.
*  They're looking bright and sunny.
*  You know, like I think it's gonna be good vibes in New York
*  for the most part this year.
*  I think it's gonna be super fun.
*  Teams that are that talented, yeah, there's a little bit
*  of hand wringing, but there's so many new toys to play with
*  in an engaging and exciting way that maybe prestige isn't
*  the right zone.
*  Maybe it's more of like an Abbott Elementary kind
*  of a situation.
*  Oh, I like it.
*  Well, I wonder, you know, this happened to poor Zingas
*  last year when, and they were a lot of seeds planted
*  the year before in Washington.
*  So it wasn't too shocking, but he comes in and it's just
*  the best version of him.
*  As you said before, they're using them in all the right ways.
*  They're not leaning on too much, but they're leaning
*  on him a lot.
*  He's whatever he's giving them.
*  That's always the best lineup they had.
*  And it was really cool.
*  It was this guy who used to be the unicorn and then he was
*  injury prone and then kind of found his spot on this team
*  and became this beloved Celtic.
*  And there's a world where that happens to Towns.
*  Like I'm definitely not ruling it out.
*  It's the most fascinating transaction we had in the off
*  season, even though we have a million transactions.
*  Towns in the Knicks is the best one.
*  Are you prepared for the outcome where a playoff series
*  is going to be determined by KP versus Towns?
*  And the Eastern Conference universe is going to ride on that.
*  It feels like we're heading that way.
*  It might.
*  It really does.
*  It feels like that it's going to be round two or round three.
*  It's going to happen.
*  All right.
*  Training camp storylines are different than season storylines.
*  Season storylines is like, you know, who's going to win the MVP.
*  Can the Celtics go back to back training camp storylines are
*  twinged and fixed and tinged, twinged, tinged, tinged,
*  tinged, tinged, and twinged in a little bit of fiction, a little
*  bit of theater, a little bit of hyperbole.
*  Yeah.
*  Little bit of you're at the farmer's market and people are
*  trying to like, Hey, you got to try the, this, these apples are
*  the best apples you're ever going to read.
*  And you're like, Oh, you get them off the truck.
*  You know, like all the other apples, you got to try these
*  cheese crisps. Like, do I?
*  So, uh, off season, I'll just give you my favorite.
*  And then you rip off all the ones you have.
*  My favorite is the Clippers trying to navigate this Kawhi Leonard
*  knee thing.
*  You got to do it.
*  Just glass half full.
*  It's going good.
*  You know, my knee, he's basically, if you read between the lines,
*  it's he's saying, my knee is never going to be the same, but I think
*  I'm going to be able to manage it guys.
*  So come, come to the Intuit Dome.
*  Because I'll be playing there.
*  Probably not, but I'll probably be playing there all year and, uh, and
*  I'll be 40% as good as I used to be, but it'll be great.
*  Come on down in the Intuit Dome.
*  Uh, I just could not believe this is like year seven of this.
*  So that jumped out to be the most you agree.
*  It is also on my list.
*  I think Clippers, Bleak Watch in general has to be on here.
*  Uh, Kawhi on media day said he does plan to be available for opening night.
*  Thank you.
*  He also said he never plans to miss games.
*  So he does often miss games.
*  He, I, I don't know that I'm like betting hard that he's going to be available
*  or maybe he's there for opening night for very political financial reasons.
*  And then quickly recedes into some scheduled rest after that.
*  It could be that kind of situation.
*  I think the problem is it's not just Kawhi.
*  This is a team that also lost Paul George that I don't know if you caught
*  this media day quote, James Harden's takeaway from watching Luca and the
*  NBA finals was that actually maybe he should dominate the ball more.
*  Uh, then the offense is definitely going to involve a lot of them.
*  They laid the blueprint that I believed in in the 2010s and that could be us.
*  That was James Harden.
*  How is it that Luca Donchich, whatever your, your priors are and your view of
*  the world, if you watch Luca Donchich, he will in some way confirm it.
*  I don't know what effect he has on people that makes him do this,
*  but it really works that way.
*  Harden.
*  Everyone else is like, this is too much of a burden for Luca.
*  They, they probably need a little bit more.
*  Uh, he's wearing down and Harden's like, I like this.
*  This is great.
*  By the way, he played with Kyrie and then demanded a trade out of there.
*  So I don't, maybe, maybe it's hard to replicate.
*  Yeah.
*  It's, uh, you know, the guy I shared season tickets with, we're excited
*  to go to the Intuit Dome.
*  I just, I, this is, I think year six of, do you want to go tonight?
*  Dot, dot, dot is Kawhi playing?
*  Not sure.
*  Let me look.
*  That's over a half decade now with Kawhi.
*  And I just, at this point he was what in the 2011 draft, right?
*  This is year 15.
*  That sounds right.
*  You're 14 or 15 for him.
*  I can't imagine whose knees were like, yeah, I had a lot of trouble with my
*  knees and then in year 15 of my career, really turned around.
*  My knees became great.
*  Well, I mean the bionic technology might be there.
*  I don't know.
*  Maybe it's brutal.
*  I, so I actually think they knew Kawhi's knees were fucked and that's why they
*  didn't want to give Paul George all that money.
*  Could be.
*  I think that's, especially when you think like he goes to the Olympic team.
*  They kind of gently send him packing in a couple of days and it's like, yeah,
*  Kawhi's decided to drop out.
*  They've fucking pushed his ass out.
*  Like they were like, we need 12 guys and you cannot, you're not in shape to play
*  and we don't think you're going to be healthy.
*  Um, and I just don't think it's going to change.
*  It's sad, but at the same time he won a title and had made a ton of money and
*  had a really interesting career and he's going to be hall of famer.
*  Um, you think you look at somebody like Derek Rose, who had that knee injury at
*  the worst possible time in his career.
*  I missed two post-seasons was never really the same like Kawhi.
*  It's better than that, but it's still a bummer.
*  We just never really got to see it for an extended stretch with the Clippers.
*  It would be half of the season, three fourths of the season.
*  Um, it just never, never happened.
*  Um, plenty of things have gone wrong for him, but the biggest possible things went
*  right.
*  And so it's hard to really frown on a career like that.
*  I think where I'm stuck with the Clippers right now is Kawhi is going to be whatever
*  sort of wild card health wise he's going to be.
*  James Harden is going to be, I would suspect more or less the player we saw last
*  year, give or take the usage will go up as he has alluded to.
*  The other part of it that worries me is some of the other chatter out of media day
*  for them was Norm Powell was talking about how losing Paul George actually might
*  be an addition by subtraction situation.
*  Cause look at all these capable guys we have step into bigger roles.
*  I don't know that I personally would be puffing out my chest at Terrence Mann and
*  Derek Jones taken on the mantle of your offense.
*  Two players I like, but I don't like like that.
*  Right.
*  And there's going to be a lot of that sort of thing for the Clippers this year.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, what do you think their odds are to make the playoffs on FanDuel?
*  Clippers make the playoffs.
*  Yes.
*  What are those odds?
*  Oh my God.
*  I don't even think they're going to be a huge job.
*  I don't even think they're going to be a play in team.
*  Well, FanDuel says plus two oh five for yes, minus two 50 for no.
*  Yeah.
*  That is brutal.
*  Like the work, the Rockets are even odds.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Right.
*  Rock Rockets are going to be a better team than the Clippers.
*  Golden state or even odds.
*  Yes.
*  You go through all these teams.
*  The consensus is after who's the worst team in league in the West Portland,
*  Portland for sure.
*  They're in play for that second worst spot.
*  If, if Kawhi is not playing healthy and then on top of it, which this would be
*  the first of many times I mentioned this on a podcast, OKC has a right to
*  swap to swap first round picks with them in 2025, which could be an absolute
*  all time, even by Clippers standards dagger.
*  If that ends up being a top three pick.
*  All right.
*  What other training camps stepped you up?
*  So you talked about OKC being the prohibitive favorite regular season wise.
*  I think we're all very high on the thunder.
*  That said, how sure are we that the Grizzlies could not
*  steal the top seed in the West?
*  I like this.
*  Something about the photos coming out of media day of seeing Ja and Bain and
*  Jackson and smart and Zach Eady, the confidence of like, we're going to pose
*  all these guys together.
*  We trust that it's going to work.
*  It really stoked my sense of like, this team is going to kill in the regular
*  season and I don't even know if they're going to solve all their half court
*  issues.
*  I'm not even saying anything about Jaws, like a guy who can crack
*  playoff level defenses.
*  I just think the West this year could be the kind of conference where you
*  win 55 games and you get first.
*  Right.
*  Cause it's so deep and the Grizzlies have done that before.
*  I think they could do it again right now.
*  Marcus smart watching the Celtics win the title chip on his shoulder.
*  There you go.
*  Moran trying to reclaim his best under 30 American superstar title from
*  Anthony Edwards.
*  A lot of chips.
*  Triple J didn't make the Olympic team.
*  Brandon Clark coming back from injury.
*  Zach Eady.
*  Nobody believed in me.
*  I'm actually the best player of this draft.
*  I like it.
*  There's a lot of stuff.
*  There's some interesting jock quotes.
*  So I don't think we talked about, we talked about, uh, self-awareness with
*  towns earlier, like I wouldn't say Jaha had like a, just a plethora of
*  self-awareness last year with some of the interviews and quotes he did, but
*  this year it did seem like he really just wanted to take back his spot in
*  the league hierarchy.
*  And he had been a little humbled by the last two years.
*  Now they could be telling him what to say, but I, it at least passed some
*  imaginary first test for me.
*  We'll see how this goes.
*  If he's on a player podcast two weeks from now saying something crazy, we'll
*  see, but, um, I like Verno on the mismatch with Jacoby shout out to those guys.
*  I had fun time listening to that.
*  Uh, Verno, Verna, first of all, Verna said Jaha was going to be first
*  team on NBA and then paused and was like, okay.
*  And then he unwound it and he said, I think he's gonna be on the one of the
*  first two teams on NBA.
*  And I was like, Whoa, that's aggressive.
*  And I started thinking about it.
*  Like he probably will be on the, if he's played 75 games and looks like
*  Joggin, he probably will be one of the four guards, right?
*  It's, it's Mitchell.
*  It's Edwards.
*  Who else is in the Curry?
*  Well, it's also positionless too.
*  So he could wiggle his way in any number of ways.
*  My doubt will never be positionless, Rob.
*  Well, what position does Luka Dodgish play?
*  I'm still unclear on that.
*  I don't know.
*  What is he?
*  I guess wing.
*  Um, one thing as far as the all NBA stuff goes, and also like, I think as
*  you're thinking about the guard hierarchy specifically, we just talked
*  about Katz impact on the Knicks.
*  I think Jalen Brunson's numbers will come down a little bit and his overall
*  driving impact may not be seen in like quite the way it was at the peak during
*  say the postseason, cause he's going to have more help.
*  He's going to have a lot more going on around him in a way where it's not.
*  So definitively Jalen Brunson carrying this thing.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that's favors guys like John, where he has a monster season.
*  There's an opportunity for here for him to, you know, overtake where Steph
*  would end up in this kind of pecking order.
*  If the warriors are kind of, you know, underwhelm again, overtake Brunson
*  potentially, although I think Jalen Brunson is a better player right now,
*  but all the narrative stuff could end up tilting in his direction.
*  Weirdly enough, even though he was the one who kind of blew up and then got
*  hurt, uh, like the momentum of this larger Grizzlies run in the first place.
*  30 to one for MVP for Joe.
*  It's pretty intriguing.
*  We're not allowed to bet on it because we have votes, but, um, you know, you
*  have to be a top three seed, which I think both of us think Memphis could be.
*  Definitely.
*  You'd have to be the best player in a really good for six straight months team,
*  which I think he qualifies for.
*  I was surprised those odds were where they were.
*  I think there's a lot of amnesia for how good he was.
*  The other one I was looking at him was the, uh, the points per game title.
*  Which he was 48 to one.
*  Who's the favorite for that?
*  The favorite is Luca plus 165, but it's probably around, I don't know, 30, 31
*  range, I don't know if Jack can get that high, but that team's going to be pretty
*  good.
*  I'm with you on Memphis.
*  I, the odds have the over under for them has been shooting up.
*  It was too low to begin with.
*  And now it feels like everybody's looking at it the same way.
*  Minnesota has this weird trade.
*  Number two, the number two seeds available.
*  What do you have for your next storyline?
*  Which of Orlando, Indiana and Cleveland can hit another gear, right?
*  Kind of the comfortable middle of the Eastern conference playoff picture.
*  I think we can say Celtics, Nick Sixers, maybe the bucks with an asterisk are sort
*  of the top of the East right now.
*  Is the, is the asterisk 37 years old and coming off multiple arthroscopic
*  surgeries?
*  I don't know.
*  I haven't talked to asterisk yet.
*  We're going to, we're going to come back.
*  I think asterisk may be in the room here with us.
*  Okay.
*  But as far as these teams go, it's so tempting cause they're all in that 47, 48
*  win range last season to think, why couldn't the magic get to 50?
*  But why couldn't the calves jump to 50 wins next season?
*  Is there any team in this group you feel very confident in taking
*  whatever the next step is?
*  Well, Sacramento is a good example of this last year where they, where they
*  went 48, but a lot of things went right for that to happen.
*  And then the league got a little better last year and all of a sudden they
*  dropped, even though they were kind of the same team.
*  Now they had to make this trade.
*  I look at Orlando as the upside team out of those because I still feel
*  like they have a trade to make.
*  I think there's somebody for them to go and get who can give them a little
*  scoring and take a little bit of a load off of, off of those other two would be,
*  would be where my head's at.
*  You know, you know, you mentioned the guards thing.
*  I forgot to mention this because I was thinking about Hal Burton where he's
*  another one like, well, he'd take the throne back.
*  I'm really interested to see what happens with Booker this season, coming
*  off the Olympic experience and you know, and not great year by his standards
*  and whether sometimes those guys play with all the great guys and you come
*  out of the Olympics and you're just better.
*  And I wonder if like a career year for him could be looming.
*  So anyway, so you had Orlando, Indiana and Cleveland and Cleveland has
*  stability, which they did not have in the same way last year.
*  Complete stability.
*  Orlando got a taste.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  Indiana has a year with Siakam.
*  That's the big thing.
*  Um, and, and some continuity for the most part, they didn't do anything crazy.
*  So which one of those three do you like the most?
*  I find myself kind of leaning Indy and I think it's sort of the combination.
*  I agree with you that upside swing wise, Orlando is the most interesting.
*  I think it's the combination of it could be Paulo or Franz who really
*  makes a big leap at some point.
*  Yeah.
*  God forbid if both of them do that would put you in a completely different tier.
*  Plus they have a lot of other interesting and players like there's a lot to like
*  there and plenty of room to think they could get better.
*  They also offensively could be the kind of team that falls into it's a very
*  different case than the Kings because that was an offense, offense, first
*  version of Sacramento, but as teams are getting more and more used to how the
*  magic play and the physicality of their defense and the limitations, I think
*  most importantly on offense, is there a solve there?
*  Is there more a way to run them a ground?
*  I think that's possible.
*  I think Orlando still can be really good.
*  Cleveland is probably the most stable baseline team, but I just don't see
*  them getting a lot better unless you really think Evan Mobley is, is ready
*  to take that step otherwise the coach piece could change it.
*  That could change it, but the team is kind of what it is.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a little lineup flexibility and in the defense of their core guys, a
*  lot of guys who can play multiple positions, which gives you some ability
*  to toggle things around and make a rotation that makes like a little bit
*  more cogent sense overall.
*  But I think with Indy, it's the combination of the full season of Siakam,
*  which is something we know.
*  Like I, I feel like I have a good grasp of who Pascal Siakam is as a player,
*  what he can do for that team, what getting a training camp with him coming
*  in, knowing he's a part of everything we'll do for you.
*  Healthy Halliburton who wasn't healthy really for four months.
*  Exactly.
*  Healthy Tyrese Halliburton.
*  And then you have the mix of what you don't know, which is can Halliburton
*  take that next step?
*  What's next for Andrew Nemhard or Ben Shepard?
*  Are they going to get anything meaningful out of Jairus Walker?
*  Ben Shepard reference.
*  Wow.
*  That was stuck that in.
*  What am I here for?
*  That was not so spring-less of stock on the Ben Shepard Express.
*  I'm buying it.
*  I'm drinking the Kool-Aid, needless to say.
*  Well, off of what you said, I have, I had a training camp storyline of, uh,
*  this is one of my favorite, cause you went traditional with that.
*  Like those three, let's, let's mine on their training camp, see who's going
*  to come out.
*  One of my favorite early training camp storylines, Donovan Mitchell wanted
*  to be in Cleveland all along.
*  Of course.
*  Come on guys.
*  This is where I always wanted to be.
*  Then there was this article, I think in the Cleveland Plain dealer, uh,
*  Mitchell thought about other possibilities.
*  It would have been a disservice not to at least consider them, but he said his
*  mind was made up early in 2024, either January or February.
*  And when given an opportunity to reinforce those words, he ain't an
*  extension, blah, blah, blah.
*  So his mind was made up either in January or February when two things happen.
*  Brooklyn was an absolute dumpster fire.
*  That was option one and the Knicks were becoming the most popular team in the
*  city with Jaylen Brunson as a top seven guy.
*  And that option was out.
*  Guess who was looking awesome?
*  The Cleveland Cavaliers.
*  I love training camp.
*  I'm going to give you another one.
*  Uh, here's another just classic.
*  It's D'Angelo Russell pretending he's not going to be shopped vigorously
*  in two months season.
*  I missed this.
*  What did he say?
*  I just got used to it.
*  He said about trade rumors.
*  Hopefully you'll know what you're going to get from me.
*  This is definitely a new field, new, everything going on with destruction with
*  JJ coming around and implementing what he's trying to do.
*  It's changed the rhythm of things around here.
*  My approach is just to stay steady.
*  D'Angelo, I hope you're running.
*  Hopefully, you know what you're going to get from me out of D'Angelo Russell's
*  mouth with all due respect.
*  I do not.
*  I do not.
*  D'Angelo, maybe don't start looking at hoops hype around early December when
*  the trade, when trade rumor season starts, because you're not going to be in the
*  team in March.
*  I'm sorry.
*  Seemed like a nice guy.
*  I appreciated Zach Levine's approach to this too on media day, which was, he kind
*  of had this like big speech about, you know, if you ever need to hear something
*  about my take, you're going to hear it from me or my agent.
*  We're going to be super straightforward with you.
*  Also, whatever's in the past, I refuse to comment on it.
*  We're not going to mention it ever again.
*  It never happened.
*  Absolutely not.
*  Do you hear me?
*  What else do you have for training camp storylines?
*  This is where the asterisk comes back.
*  I can't stop worrying about the bucks.
*  I want to believe I am a Yanis guy.
*  I think any team that has him on it is destined for a very hard floor, like his
*  effort level, his play, his dominance can absolutely take you so far.
*  The fact that he said he and Dame did not have a chance to meet up at all this
*  summer is both extremely understandable for a guy who played in the Olympics and
*  also got married.
*  I get it.
*  It also does not make me feel any better about a team that does not see me.
*  We'll have Chris Middleton to start the season that already had like a work in
*  progress feel as far as the chemistry of those guys and hasn't done anything in
*  the off season to change the mix in a big way.
*  Right.
*  They got seventh, eighth and ninth men and they kind of tossed away their draft
*  pick on a 19 year old.
*  Yeah.
*  I had, I had as a, as a subset of that, the Chris Middleton.
*  Yeah, it's still butter, but it's going to be fine.
*  It's all going to be fine.
*  It's all going to be fine.
*  It's October 1st guys.
*  Is he playing?
*  Oh, he's not out there yet.
*  This doesn't sound fine.
*  It's not great.
*  Also he's old by NBA swing man standards.
*  Um, he has been really hurt every year since the 2021 finals.
*  And I have real concerns that he's your shutdown guy against the Jason
*  Tatum's of the world as you should be.
*  And this is the cross that I bear as someone who thinks Chris Middleton is very
*  good is the idea of him being injured and out of the lineup to me.
*  I'm like, this is a vital part of this team.
*  And I am now freaked out by the depth chart when he's not out there.
*  That's not where you want to be with Chris at this stage.
*  Now.
*  And another training camp storyline is Dame his head's right.
*  Last year was the year from hell.
*  A lot of personal stuff traded out of nowhere.
*  Didn't work out before the year because he was afraid he was going to get hurt.
*  And, um, Yannis gets hurt in the playoffs.
*  Everything that went wrong could go wrong.
*  Coach changed.
*  Terry Stotz.
*  But now.
*  Had the summer I worked out.
*  I'm ready.
*  I'm here.
*  I'm ready to reclaim my throne.
*  I don't know if it's true, but it sounded good.
*  Um, I had, uh, I had a cousin of this speaking of old teams and I agree with
*  you on Milwaukee and I'm probably more bullish on Milwaukee than most, cause I
*  just think Yannis is going to be on a, just a psychotic tear this year.
*  We're going to be like, Yannis is psychotic.
*  Um, and I mean that in a positive way for the aggregators.
*  Like positive competitive, wanting to win, being a psycho about winning.
*  Gleefully psychotic.
*  Gleefully competitively psychotic.
*  Um, Jimmy Butler didn't get an extension over the off season, but it's fine.
*  Yep.
*  That's a good training camp storyline.
*  It's fine.
*  Didn't need the extension.
*  It's fine.
*  I also have a cousin of this one, which is Jimmy Butler showed up without a perm.
*  And actually it worked on me.
*  I am buying serious Jimmy Butler showing up ready for business.
*  Yeah.
*  He's not fucking around on photo day anymore.
*  Absolutely.
*  Absolutely not fucking around.
*  And I say this.
*  Yes.
*  I realize I am a Rube.
*  I realize I am playing right into Jimmy's elaborate plot and probably like a big
*  face coffee marketing scheme in some way.
*  Like I know I'm being had, but also Jimmy Butler taking the regular season
*  seriously is a massive fucking deal.
*  If it happens for the heat.
*  Cause that is it.
*  Like I know they can make the finals as a seventh seed, but you should not try to
*  do that every year, you should actually try to win games and get into the middle
*  of the East and there's a reason I didn't even talk about them in that Orlando,
*  Cleveland, Indiana mix is I don't entirely know that they deserve it, but also I
*  feel myself buying back into what they're selling.
*  Well, and they also did the thing where they're like, we don't know what our
*  roster is going to be in February.
*  And we're not going to, we're not going to kill ourselves figuring out now.
*  We'll see how it goes.
*  Which I thought kind of the Knicks were doing, and then all of a sudden they're
*  training for talents, but I think they looked around and they were probably
*  intrigued by a bunch of different things.
*  I'm sure they kicked the tires on marketing.
*  I'm sure they kicked the tires on.
*  At least had a meeting about Zach Levine.
*  Sure.
*  Right.
*  I'm sure they at least had a meeting about any guy making over $30 billion who
*  was available, but ultimately they kept their flexibility.
*  We'll see with hero.
*  I think, uh, I don't know what the, uh, trade that they kind of really needed him
*  to be a trade value guy, and they almost were able to get him in a damedale and,
*  um, maybe got a little too aggressive with it, but, um, they kind of need him
*  to be really good this year, either for them or as a trade piece.
*  And that's kind of related to the Jimmy thing too.
*  I think those are really the only guys as far as upside goes, they can get Miami
*  to like over the hump of mediocrity on offense.
*  That's a team that's really struggled to create shots.
*  Jimmy is a guy who can get to the line consistently.
*  One of the only players on the team that can do that.
*  He also has like the low hanging fruit of the cuts and the fast breaks that can,
*  that can juice the numbers a little bit.
*  Hero just has to, he has to be flat better than he's been.
*  I think, I think Bam is kind of reaching who he can be and who he is as a player.
*  I don't expect anything dramatically different from him, but they need something
*  dramatically different from Tyler hero.
*  So you're not going to write the BAM is expanding his offense and an effort to
*  grow the heat, but it's the same thing every year with Bam.
*  I was just going to do like a 3000 word Haywood Highsmith feature, but if you
*  want to vet that we can talk about it.
*  Joel Embiid, we mentioned him earlier.
*  He was talking about how he lost weight and he said, I still got a ways to go.
*  I still want to lose some more.
*  We got to do whatever it takes to make sure that in the postseason, I'm healthy.
*  There's no agenda, no all-star, no all NBA.
*  I'm just going to let that sit there for a second.
*  So Joel is basically saying the postseason is now what matters.
*  All right.
*  Better late than never is 30 years old, but maybe he gets it.
*  I don't know.
*  What would you take?
*  This is where, you know what my instinct is to say, maybe you should have
*  cared about those things previously.
*  Oh yeah.
*  You think so doctor?
*  Look, that's my instinct.
*  I am trying.
*  I'm trying to grow.
*  I'm trying to be a bigger person.
*  I'm trying to be positive.
*  And I think what you're supposed to do is encourage positive behaviors
*  when they happen around you, not point out, oh, you're the guy who
*  shows up late all the time.
*  I'm so glad you're here, Joel Embiid.
*  I'm so glad that you are here in this way, in this fashion.
*  I genuinely hope that whatever body transformation you say you have had,
*  it suits you and works well.
*  And I hope this whole season goes brilliantly.
*  We all would love to see Joel Embiid in an actual competitive high level
*  playoff series or just run start to finish.
*  I think that's something that we're all waiting for.
*  So for the sake of wanting to believe in the change, I'm here.
*  I'm here for you, Joel.
*  I'm believing I'm choosing to buy into this.
*  I agree.
*  I was on the record as I cannot take him seriously as the best guy on a
*  team that wins four straight playoff rounds until he shows up for a season
*  in shape and understands that it's a nine month run.
*  It seems like we've checked the first box.
*  So congrats to him.
*  We can skip over the training camp storyline of we want Brandon
*  Ingram here in New Orleans, which I'm sure is going to be said by somebody
*  over at some point and there's probably, it's going to be like a hostage video.
*  JJ coaching LeBron and his son dot dot dot.
*  This won't be weird at all.
*  That's another storyline.
*  No, it's going to be, it's going to be cool.
*  It's not going to be a circus in any way.
*  It's going to be a lot of fun.
*  It's going to be cool.
*  It's not going to be a circus in any way, shape or form.
*  What is, what is your competitive history with your son?
*  Do you play sports together against each other?
*  Like what is the dynamic between you?
*  He started playing tennis this year and, um, and I was like, you'll never beat me.
*  I will have to like be in a wheelchair or using a walker for you to beat me.
*  And he's like, I will beat you by the time I'm 18.
*  Um, and he also thinks he, he, when he was 10, he thought he could beat me in a fight.
*  So I would say super competitive.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, he said UFC right now he would tap me out in a minute.
*  Yeah, it's competitive.
*  So I don't know how that with LeBron and his son, I don't know how that goes with that,
*  but I would assume the son's just trying to take it to him at all times.
*  Like how, what, that's what sons do with dads.
*  It's the best part about being a son is lighten up your dad, throwing him under the
*  bus, airing out, airing out.
*  Absolutely.
*  Airing out exactly how lame he is.
*  I think the key here is that all of the bronze, like eccentricities are out there.
*  You know, like how, how much is Bronnie going to tell us or tell his teammates or
*  tell anyone within the organization about, oh, here's this crazy thing my dad did.
*  Like, yeah, he put that on Instagram.
*  I saw it.
*  Like we all know about it.
*  My son would definitely do that to me.
*  There's no question.
*  The whole situation is very strange.
*  I think it will be aided only by the fact that Bronnie is not in a position right
*  now to threaten by merit to play NBA minutes.
*  Will he play anyway?
*  I guess we'll see.
*  I suspect they're going to get out the let's put them on the floor together, have
*  the moment kind of thing relatively early.
*  Put them in the G league.
*  Yeah.
*  So that the questions stop coming.
*  Uh, it's going to get more awkward if Bronnie is actually like a part of this
*  thing in a, in a real way, whether he's shoehorned into that role, whether he
*  lights it up in the G league or like succeed so much as a pressure defender.
*  And the Lakers need exactly that.
*  That's when it gets weird.
*  I think they're almost helped right now by the fact that no one is really
*  expecting that much of Bronnie.
*  He's either two years away or two years away from being two years away.
*  But I just don't see how he's going to play in a rotation for a team that's
*  trying to make the playoffs.
*  That seems inconceivable to me.
*  He does not.
*  Appear to be that, uh, for a bunch of reasons.
*  I think honestly, even though the defense is kind of the strength right now, I
*  think even that needs a ton of work as it often does for rookie guards coming
*  into the league, any more training camp storylines, honestly, those are the big
*  ones for me.
*  Yeah.
*  That's anything else dangling out there.
*  That Celtics it's, it's all fine.
*  The Tatum's Tatum's heads in the right place.
*  Then there's going to be some story in November about how he had to fix his
*  shot and he couldn't remember how to shoot it anymore and drew a hand and
*  fixed it.
*  That that'll happen in like November.
*  Yeah.
*  And he had a shot.
*  How do you feel about the, the relative ironing out of the Zapruder
*  footage of Jason Tatum's jumper?
*  You saw the hitch, right?
*  Oh, it was there.
*  Like, yeah, yeah.
*  That I was on a lot of tech threads over the summer from how he shot in
*  rookie year, sophomore year for the Celtics versus whatever that stop hitch
*  thing he was doing the Olympics.
*  And I think he got rid of it.
*  Sometimes it happens.
*  It happens in tennis, throwing a baseball, uh, golf people, although all
*  of a sudden their swing gets fucked up.
*  They don't know what happened.
*  So I think, I think that's what happened.
*  We'll see if, uh, I honestly, Jalen Brown shaving his beard was the
*  biggest conversation piece for the Celtic fans in my life.
*  Yeah.
*  Shook you up.
*  Cause he was, he had really grown it out.
*  And then all of a sudden he went back to like 2019 Jalen.
*  So I was surprised by that.
*  What does that say about him?
*  Do you think like, where is he mentally that he's shaving the beard?
*  You know what that told me?
*  My new girlfriend doesn't like my beard and it scratches her face
*  and she asked me to shave it.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what it told me.
*  That's the spirit of compromise.
*  We can support it.
*  Before we go, you wrote about Matumbo for the ringer.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, a really beloved, beloved, beloved on and off the court guy.
*  And it was the case when he played, um, he was certainly like going to
*  games in the nineties and the two thousands, somebody that just stood out.
*  On the court, which is pretty rare when you have a bunch of super tall guys,
*  there's something different about how he carried himself.
*  And, um, his style was so unique where he was like this cross of.
*  I don't know, like what Mark Eaton blocking shots in the eighties, but
*  way better and way more athletic, but also had like a little bit of an
*  offensive game and it seemed conceivable in 2001, this was the one guy that
*  might be able to slow down Shaq at his peak, peak, peak, and then Shaq just
*  was like, no, not even this guy's stopping me, um, didn't have as many
*  playoff moments as I probably would have liked.
*  Yeah.
*  Went to Atlanta.
*  Like the Denver one, if you're going to have a moment, that's the one you want.
*  I think the regret I have with his career was switching from Denver to Atlanta.
*  I think it's just more fun if he stays in Denver, goes to Atlanta, you know,
*  whatever, it was just weird.
*  I didn't, I don't really have fond memories of those Atlanta teams, but
*  what happened to him with Houston when Darrell latched onto him and he's part
*  of like that 20, 22 game winning streak team and he became one of these early
*  advanced metrics guys where people are like, Hey, when Matumbo's in all of
*  these good things happen, even if like he barely shoots anyway, he lasts two
*  decades and then has just an incredible impact in the league itself and was just
*  beloved.
*  What, when you're writing about it, what were the things that jumped out to you?
*  I mean, for one, I think the fact that he was a four time defensive player of
*  the year winner who was left off the NBA 75 team, I don't feel great about
*  it.
*  And I think, plus if you zoom out in like, how do we tell the story of basketball
*  history in these modern eras?
*  I think to Kimbe Matumbo is a big part of it.
*  I think the finger wag iconography is such a huge thing.
*  I think the fact that he was a part of a lot of, if not highly successful winning
*  and very memorable teams, that kind of stuff does matter.
*  And ultimately I think what you're alluding to with like the on-off stuff
*  and like what those kinds of numbers capture with a player like him is he's
*  intimidating as hell.
*  Even when he was like pushing 40, guys were afraid to challenge him because he
*  was such a successful shot blocker, because he was going to let you know all
*  about it afterwards.
*  And I think that the contrast of warm and fuzzy, like big laughing to Kimbe
*  Matumbo, who is just like one of, I think the foremost like charitable forces that
*  the modern NBA has seen in terms of the work he's done around the world and in
*  Africa specifically contrasted with like, this guy's also like an asshole who's
*  laughing in your face on the court.
*  Those are the sorts of contrasts that always endear a player to me.
*  And I think with Matumbo, there's just so much to like, and there's so many, so
*  many stages of his career and his life you could latch onto and say, like for
*  you, it's not the Hawks.
*  There's someone out there for whom they see that they, when they think of Matumbo,
*  they think of him with that broad picture of the Hawk across the front of the
*  Jersey.
*  And I love that he can mean so many different things to so many different people.
*  Well, there was also three, three other pieces with him, the voice, which
*  everyone imitated, which was just one of the iconic sports voices.
*  Everyone did it.
*  Then the subset of that was the inside the NBA guys.
*  They just loved him.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Barkley had so much joy.
*  They would always get so much Matumbo material.
*  But, but from an unintentional comedy standpoint, in a good way, his, I felt
*  like he was the pioneer of the slam dunk contest reactions.
*  Oh yeah.
*  He was the first one when they would cut to and, and whatever his reaction was,
*  was always the best one.
*  And then I felt like for the next 20 years, it was everybody doing a Matumbo
*  reaction, but his were completely genuine.
*  He had a million of them and it was, it really became one of the funniest parts
*  of the slam dunk contest was him going nuts, him holding his head, him, him with
*  his thing, him turning around and complete disbelief.
*  And, uh, I don't know.
*  He just, I don't, there's not many guys who had a higher approval rate in than
*  them.
*  There's nobody who was like, fuck Matumbo.
*  Like everybody, everybody loved that guy.
*  And then after he retired, um, was a really important MBA guy behind the
*  scenes, I think really beloved and had a huge, huge, huge impact and, uh, did so
*  much charitable stuff and, uh, everybody really liked him.
*  I think, I think it says a lot that even the guys of his era who he had, like
*  ostensible rivalries with, or was, was blocking or they were trying to dunk on
*  him, it was just like a running bit.
*  Like there's the legendary clip of him bragging to Jordan that he'd never dunked
*  on him before and Jordan getting him and finger wagging in his face.
*  And there's, you could, there's similar things, as you said, with, with Matumbo
*  and Shaq, like with all of these greats of his era, he was like a counterpoint
*  in at some point in their careers and some point.
*  And one of the fun things writing the O bit was figuring out like all the players
*  that he had blocked over the course of his career.
*  And when you play as long as he has, it is like you've blocked Jordan and LeBron
*  up until Chris Paul, up until some guys who were drafted even a little later than
*  that, who are current or will be all time great players.
*  And he's blocked all those guys.
*  And I remember when I was trying to do my book, I didn't have him in the pyramid
*  and he came close, but I just didn't have them.
*  And it came down to the all NBA stuff and the lack of, uh, really only being on
*  that one finals team, which he got traded into halfway during the season.
*  With that said, they just had bad luck that year because they go against the
*  O-1 Lakers who were one of the four or five greatest playoff teams of all time.
*  I think if they had caught the O2 Lakers, they might've actually been able to steal
*  a series from them.
*  But O-1, nobody was beating that team.
*  And they even, they got one game off them in overtime.
*  But, uh, it's just that, that Kobe and Shaq together that year was just unstoppable.
*  So that was his one chance and then it didn't happen.
*  Anyway, even then, like the interviews with him after the fact, seemed like he
*  felt pretty good about how they did.
*  You know, it's not like he's hanging his head.
*  It's like you ran into what was kind of an unstoppable juggernaut.
*  You stole a game.
*  You like acclimated yourself.
*  Well, you can go home and be proud with what you did at the end of the day.
*  I think Matobo has always been one of these guys who has had very clear
*  perspective on what matters and what matters to him is competing and playing
*  hard and embarrassing these guys.
*  It's also like, you got to live a full rich life and benefit your community
*  and the people around you.
*  And he's always been great about that.
*  All right.
*  Check out that piece that Rob wrote on theringer.com and you can hear Rob
*  on the Ringer MBA show and on the Prestige TV podcast, Breaking Down,
*  Slow Horses with Karl Anthony Towns season five.
*  We'll see how that goes.
*  Good to see Rob.
*  Thanks, Bill.
