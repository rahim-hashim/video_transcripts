# The Teams That Can Actually Win the West | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [March 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZqJvdMYZvU)
*  I'm going to read you all the teams in the West and you tell me how many of them do you think could win, could actually win the West.
*  So we'll say Denver.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  For Denver.
*  Yep.
*  No, until we get clarity with Ja and Steven Adams, Adams out for the rest of the season for them.
*  He's been so critical for them on both ends and with Ja, we just don't know right now, Bill.
*  So I can't, I can't say with any confidence I can talk myself into the Grizzlies winning the finals.
*  They're young anyway, even with those guys.
*  Yeah, I can't write off a two seed, but at the same time, the Ja stuff sounds really concerning.
*  Like, wait, like there's been bits and drabs of information coming out, but in the whisper circles, it really doesn't seem like we're going to see him again this season.
*  And we'll find out more information.
*  It's not like he has to tell us what's going on, but it seems like this is now a, let's all take a break.
*  Let's reassess in a couple of weeks and get some help or whatever's going on.
*  And I think they're doing a good thing, not telling us what's happening, but I can't write them off because there's a world where he just comes back in three weeks and he looks good.
*  And they have home court advantage in the first two rounds.
*  So I'm like a half yes on them.
*  Sacramento, I think we're both yes, although I'm probably a little more excited than you about them.
*  Half hearted.
*  I mean, like Mahoney came on the mismatch last night because Verna was out and we talked a little bit about the Kings and with their defense, like it's tough.
*  I mean, like they have the 25th ranked defensive rating.
*  The Lakers and O-1 are the last team that has won the finals having a bottom 10 defensive rating.
*  And with them, like they have Kobe and Shaq, their team that was coasting, going for a repeat, you know, they're over the course of the regular season.
*  The Kings just don't have that upside.
*  Granted, they have the number one offensive rating by far.
*  They can play any style they want to in any series.
*  I don't think their offense is going to slip at all in the playoffs.
*  I just don't think their defense is good enough.
*  But with that said, like you were mentioning, you can't write off a two seed.
*  But Sacramento, like they do have a path.
*  I mean, if they win the first round and depending on what's going on with the with Memphis and John and all that, they can find themselves in a West final.
*  So you can't rule them out kind of scoring their way to the NBA finals.
*  But it's kind of a half hearted yes on my side.
*  KFC, you just lost your invite to the light the beam ceremony at the Western Finals.
*  Guess who's not invited?
*  You, KFC.
*  They don't want you now.
*  I had to earn back my invite after I tweeted about if the Lakers offered both picks in Westbrook for Fox in October, would the Kings just take those picks and start over?
*  And Kings fans are still mad about it.
*  You didn't get a lifetime ban for that, Bill.
*  No, I'm back.
*  I had them. The over was one of my locks of the year.
*  I'm in. I had Malik Monk on my podcast.
*  Phoenix, I think, would be a yes for both of us, right?
*  Yeah, definitely.
*  How about Golden State?
*  Yes, basically looking like a five seed right now where they would have a game seven on the road in every series they play and they are seven and 26 on the road this season.
*  I can't write them off.
*  I can't quit you.
*  Gold state.
*  No, you can't.
*  You can't quit a team with Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson and dream on green.
*  We just saw them score seventy five points in the first half the other night with Klay Thompson having thirty three and Steph is still Steph.
*  And the fact is that with them, Bill, not having Andrew Wiggins is the big reason why I think you can have hesitations like we're talking about with Memphis, with Adams and Ja Wiggins has been their second or third best player, a critical wing defender, super versatile, a knockdown shooter, and he can do what he needs to do for that offense in the half court as a score off the dribble.
*  So until we find out clarity with Wiggins, it's like a hard to fully buy in with Golden State.
*  But at the same time, it seems like he'll come back, you would think, before the playoffs occurs, comments on Saturday seem to indicate more so.
*  We don't know if it'll happen during the regular season.
*  I'm never writing them off, especially after last year when I think I wrote them off 17 times, but it's been a pretty they've been a 500 team for 70 games, basically clippers.
*  I can't write them off either.
*  How come?
*  Kawhi and Paul George. I'd like certain lineups that they play when they play man with those guys. I think defensively, they're going to be able to get stops. We know the playoffs slows down and I just can't rule them out yet.
*  In a weak West, I cannot.
*  I think that's fair because of how flimsy the West is. Yeah.
*  Yeah, I don't like what I see from them.
*  I'm not confident.
*  I'm not. This isn't a situation where I'm like, man, it's going to be so cool when the Clippers are in the finals and I can go with my season tickets.
*  I'm not feeling that way at all.
*  And Clippers curse Clippers history, all that stuff.
*  But I can't read my Kawhi.
*  The Kawhi is the only reason why there's any belief with with the Clippers and some vets.
*  Ty Lue has coached in some games that get subtracted by Russell Westbrook, the presence of him.
*  I feel like he's going to be gone by like April 7th.
*  Hey, remember when Russell Westbrook was on the Clippers for three weeks?
*  Minnesota, I'm writing off. Yeah, fair.
*  Dallas, I'm writing off.
*  Definitely fair. Their defense stinks.
*  Yeah, that that team doesn't have it.
*  That kind of trade is going to be I think that's going to look like a swollen pulsating zit in about two weeks.
*  Lakers.
*  I'm not writing off at 33 and 35.
*  We have no idea if LeBron's coming back this season.
*  And yet I can't write them off.
*  And part of me wonders, did you catch that thing where Darwin Ham said LeBron was gone for a week?
*  And now it's great to have him back with the team.
*  It's like, where did LeBron go?
*  I just feel like, you know, we've seen him kind of ramp up for eight to 10 weeks physically.
*  And maybe that's all he can do at this point.
*  But I keep coming back to the bubble where that long, long break bubble ends and LeBron looks awesome for.
*  What was that? Nine, 10 weeks.
*  And could that be lurking this time?
*  Like could as long as they just get in, could does he have nine weeks and I'm not betting against him?
*  Well, Ham said everything's going according to plan.
*  LeBron's shooting before the game.
*  He posts the photo on Instagram of him like a hyperbaric chamber recharge.
*  Yeah, he's coming back.
*  He's going to be the first person to beat Planter Fasciitis in like six weeks.
*  Six month injury.
*  LeBron's like, no, I did it in six weeks.
*  Pelkin's writing off.
*  Everyone else in the West writing off.
*  So we basically had one, two, three for me, four, five, six, seven teams we could see winning the West.
*  That's insane.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think I had six because I said no on Memphis.
*  Yeah, I had seven.
*  You had six.
*  Yeah.
*  And like of those, I mean, the Lakers are the bottom that we're saying yes to, but they're probably not sixth or seventh.
*  You know, sixth or seventh on our respective boards.
*  You know, we're talking finals favorites in the West.
*  Are they?
*  They're from a Vegas standpoint.
*  They are.
*  I probably have them in the in the top five for me just because the rest of the West is so weak.
*  And if they can just time the LeBron AD thing and just get like four weeks out of those guys together, as crazy as that sounds, that might be enough to get them in round three.
*  I just I have so many questions about whether those guys can stay in the court.
*  To me, that is that's even shakier than am I going to get six more weeks out of Kawhi?
*  Like if I had my injury, who do I believe in the least rankings?
*  I would have both LeBron and AD over Kawhi in terms of staying healthy.
*  LeBron after this time off though.
*  Right.
*  Well, that's the thing.
*  Fresh off his trip to Germany or wherever, hyperbaria land, wherever the hell he went.
*  But, you know, he's you know, he's getting all the other doctors trying to work on that thing.
