# The Lakers Are Set for Another Successful Run | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPabz7iFhjw)
*  46 and a half plus 370 for the division.
*  A wager I may have already made.
*  Plus 750 for the conference.
*  13 one for the title, plus 850 for the one seed.
*  They were 43 and 39 last year,
*  and that was after they started what, one and 10?
*  And had the most dysfunctional October, November possible.
*  It just kills me.
*  You like them, you think they're good and you like them.
*  I really like them.
*  Is this the most you've liked them in?
*  I really liked the team.
*  I'd like what they did.
*  I like the assets.
*  The team makes sense to me.
*  I think they can survive LeBron disappearing for 15 games
*  and they'd be okay.
*  I think they have a lot of trade assets.
*  House, they have the Russell contract,
*  the Max Christie and Hood Shafino, they have two firsts.
*  Yeah, they're first, they kept that first.
*  Castleton, that was the thing.
*  Super frisky in December, January.
*  And I just think this team's gonna be really good.
*  I thought they were good last year.
*  I thought they were the second best team in the league
*  by the end of the season.
*  And if you're gonna tell me LeBron James,
*  this is year 21 and this is now too unrealistic,
*  I think it's actually pretty realistic
*  that he can be still a top 30 guy in the league
*  and they use him as a DH anyway.
*  I thought they relied on him too much last year
*  in the playoffs, but to me it's like-
*  I don't think they had a choice.
*  I would have done more Reeves.
*  I really felt like Reeves was cooking in that series.
*  Maybe this year Reeves gets more, but I'm way over.
*  What are you, Rossello?
*  I'm over.
*  I like this team a lot and I'm honestly pretty blown away.
*  Like when you think about the job a front office can do
*  to figure this out on a fly.
*  And then always like, you better hope
*  you don't get what you want.
*  Because think how different it would be without the depth
*  and having Kyrie and it's like, cool, you got Kyrie.
*  And neither pick, they would have lost both picks.
*  Yeah, so it really comes down to this.
*  Like if Anthony Davis is gonna play like playoff
*  Anthony Davis where I couldn't, I mean, I had like,
*  like it was a PSA.
*  I watched him in that Memphis regular season game
*  and I went, I'm out.
*  I can't do it anymore.
*  Every time he falls down, I think he's done.
*  It's gonna happen with Zion in like January.
*  Maybe, but then as soon as I did it-
*  The All Out podcast.
*  Right, but as soon as I did it,
*  like it's almost like he had to keep falling down
*  and build up the scar tissue to it.
*  And it was like, so then when he fell down again,
*  people weren't joking like seven to 10 days.
*  Like they would do it a scores table
*  every time he fell down.
*  So if Anthony Davis is close to being right
*  and he was real right in the playoffs,
*  like that's the whole point.
*  That's the reason why you freak out about this guy.
*  When a real conversation was happening,
*  it's like, would you just be better off trading him?
*  And the problem is, is like, if you wanna trade him,
*  that means that he's been hurt so much
*  that you need to figure out something else.
*  And that means his mark.
*  So like the best version of this,
*  a lot of times is the patience.
*  And I like him.
*  I like the team.
*  I like the depth.
*  I mean, look, I'm not gonna like D'Angelo Russell,
*  everybody knows that, but.
*  I don't think he's on the team in February.
*  Well, that contract reeks of like,
*  I know I'm getting traded.
*  I think they wink winked at it with him and like,
*  hey, we're gonna pay you extra
*  and you might not be on the team in February.
*  How's Anthony Davis turns 31 in March.
*  He's made four All-NBA teams, none since 2020.
*  He's never even been top two in the MVP.
*  And yet he is considered to be
*  one of the league's best players.
*  Is that justified?
*  Absolutely, positively yes.
*  What he did in delivering that team
*  to the playoffs last year
*  and putting them in a position to get swept by Denver.
*  But those were by far the most competitive games
*  of the entire NBA finals.
*  So the entire NBA playoffs with the Lakers and Nuggets.
*  Those were the best games.
*  They were the most competitive games.
*  And there's a physicality they still have
*  that they had last year
*  that is gonna be a real problem for a lot of these teams.
*  Like when they play Phoenix,
*  if they're against Phoenix in a playoff series,
*  that's gonna be a fascinating matchup
*  where on one hand a lot of offense,
*  on the other hand the Lakers are just gonna be
*  a bit overpowered.
*  I think they bullied the F.O.B.
*  Yeah, they did it to the Warriors.
*  I mean the Warriors had a real crisis.
*  Worst possible matchup for the Warriors.
*  Because you just knew like anytime,
*  anything with any momentum,
*  even with LeBron towards the hoop,
*  it was a good look.
*  And if Davis wasn't scoring a ton,
*  he was cleaning everything up,
*  he was changing it.
*  It was kind of nice to see a big guy.
*  The Davis that we all fell in love with,
*  the reason why this guy was that boring
*  was that hey, he's the big guy.
*  Even though there's still some numbers with him,
*  we were like how come you don't shoot it
*  the way you used to shoot it or whatever.
*  But.
*  Well they lucked out,
*  they got the Reeves deal done
*  for just the craziest possible contract.
*  He had an awesome team USA.
*  There's a Janobli, I think,
*  kind of ceiling for him as a really, really
*  crafty, creative offensive guard
*  who's not afraid of the moment,
*  who seems like he gets better
*  whatever stage it's in,
*  who's feisty, really, really, really
*  special playoff player for where he came from,
*  where he wasn't even drafted.
*  I don't know, Rui Hachimora?
*  I don't know.
*  They paid him.
*  Do you trust it?
*  All the feedback in the summer
*  and the preseason was pretty good.
*  You have to trust it.
*  This is the thing,
*  like all of these guys that they've acquired,
*  they're going to be different players
*  because of this situation with LeBron,
*  with Anthony Davis.
*  I was as skeptical as anybody of Hachimora.
*  I said, good luck.
*  But the situation was so radically different for him.
*  It was a revelation and he flourished.
*  He earned the money that they gave him.
*  And he gave them,
*  he kept that bully ball thing for them.
*  Vincent's perfect.
*  It was so funny when they signed him.
*  I was like, as somebody who hates the Lakers,
*  I was like, oh, god damn it, really?
*  I got that guy too.
*  I think Rui is a little overrated
*  because of the playoff games.
*  Sure, he's still under 30% from three.
*  I don't trust him.
*  Yeah.
*  He's physically so much bigger at times.
*  You're like, god damn, is he big?
*  And then he'll hit a couple of turnarounds
*  and he went off a couple of the Memphis games.
*  But for the most part, you look at the numbers,
*  you're like, how much does he have to pay this guy again?
*  So, I mean, there's a reason why,
*  with LA it's going to be easier for him.
*  There's not as much of a burden.
*  He's not a lottery picker.
*  He's in Washington.
*  But the fact that Washington
*  could only get a second rounder for him,
*  I think speaks to a lot of the people
*  who turn the page on Drew.
*  And there's only a couple of team places for him to go.
*  It's a deep team.
*  I have no idea if Christian Wood's gonna play
*  one meaningful minute for them.
*  Well, no, he'll play.
*  He'll play and he'll come in.
*  If he's with the second unit,
*  he's gonna make a bunch of shots.
*  If people are gonna look at his numbers.
*  It was a good risk for them.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  LeBron's one of the greatest basketball players of all time.
*  And you wanna throw different people next to him
*  that could go either way.
*  Right, and I'll get you LeBron in a private moment
*  after two months, be like,
*  don't fucking play this guy with me anymore.
*  Right, and LeBron will be like,
*  get that guy out of here and they'll get him out.
*  Or he'll be like, I like this guy.
*  And they'll take, well, no.
*  That won't happen.
*  He'll go, I don't wanna, whenever you sub him in,
*  take me out.
*  LeBron sees him at the table
*  and just starts walking to the bench.
*  LeBron has 1,703 games.
*  Playoffs, regular season combined.
*  66,000 minutes getting close to that.
*  That's awesome.
*  It's not realistic anymore,
*  so I'm not gonna do the thing.
*  It's become like Brady those last couple years.
*  Where you're like, you know what, I'm out.
*  I'm out trying to figure out if this is the year
*  when all of a sudden this isn't gonna happen anymore.
*  It's just, is he gonna play 25 years?
*  Maybe.
*  I don't know. Well, because it doesn't matter.
*  Anybody going, well, he's gonna slow down.
*  What do you want?
*  You want your own TV show for that one?
*  Great, but.
*  He can still go to the basket.
*  He's impossible to defend a referee.
*  He can get in the paint and do things.
*  He can coast and get 30 still.
*  He's the smartest guy in the league
*  as a basketball player.
*  He can solve any issue.
*  But he doesn't have to, he almost figures out,
*  okay, I'm gonna go hard on the second sub in
*  in the first half.
*  I'm gonna try these six minutes.
*  The third quarter when they put that sub in,
*  that's when I'm gonna put my gear in.
*  I love the over.
*  This is gonna be one of my locks.
*  I also really like the one seed bet for them plus 850,
*  because I think this team has a chance
*  to be in the mid-50s.
*  I just like the value of it.
*  I'll just tell you that I'll reveal in the part three
*  whether I pick Celtics versus Lakers
*  or Celtics Nuggets as my finals.
*  But those are the three teams for me.
*  And Milwaukee probably four.
*  I really like what they did.
*  Polinka, that dude almost got fired.
*  19th Magic completely threw him under the bus
*  that one summer.
*  LeBron was basically trying to force them
*  to do all this stuff last year
*  and give away every asset they had.
*  He kinda held the course.
*  He made some really good trades.
