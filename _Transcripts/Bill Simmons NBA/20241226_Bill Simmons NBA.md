# Pat Riley Checkmates Jimmy Butler, Plus An NBA Xmas Recap  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [December 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q)
*  Pat Riley came out and he said definitively the Miami heater not traded Jimmy Butler. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=0.0s)]
*  He's going to be on this team for the rest of the season. Came out and said it put it out in a statement [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=6.24s)]
*  so people could read it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  We don't see NBA teams do this that often, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=13.76s)]
*  but I think it speaks to a bigger picture thing that we've discussed on this podcast a couple times now this month [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=16.64s)]
*  with this new first apron, second apron, how much harder it is to do trades. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  The NBA is starting to look a lot more like the NFL. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=27.02s)]
*  It is so much harder to deal somebody during the season than it used to be, which is what Riley said. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=29.779999999999998s)]
*  We're not dealing him during the season. We'll figure it out during the offseason. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=34.739999999999995s)]
*  Butler's 48 million and then 52 million dollar player option next year, which [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=38.5s)]
*  odds are he's gonna he's gonna exercise because nobody has cap space this summer. The only team is Brooklyn. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=43.9s)]
*  He's gonna go to Brooklyn. They're gonna be rebuilding and just sign Jimmy Butler. I mean, it's conceivable. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=49.22s)]
*  I just would have bet on it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=53.9s)]
*  And Pat Riley is looking big picture and looking at an NBA that now operates way more like the NFL [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=56.3s)]
*  where it's way harder just to do big complicated deals. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=62.7s)]
*  And he didn't like the deals that were out there and they clearly kicked the tires with a bunch of teams. Houston, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=66.22s)]
*  I think came out and said they weren't interested. I think they're holding out for Darren Fox, which House and I talk about in a second. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=70.94s)]
*  But you go around that Golden State. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=76.94s)]
*  What's the point of them trading for Jimmy Butler? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=79.42s)]
*  They're not even really a contender right now and they're going to give up all these assets so they can try to be the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=81.34s)]
*  fifth best team in the west on a very short window. I'm not doing that if I'm if I'm Golden State. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=86.06s)]
*  You look around at some of the other [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=91.9s)]
*  some of the other stuff that's happening. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=94.14s)]
*  You know, I'm sure Phoenix would talk about Bradley Beal for Jimmy Butler, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=95.74000000000001s)]
*  but why would Miami want to turn Jimmy Butler into Bradley Beal? Why would they want to do any of these trades? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=98.86000000000001s)]
*  They already have somebody who [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=104.06s)]
*  when he's pissed off and playing well, he's a top 30 guy. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=106.7s)]
*  They're not just going to take more contracts. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=110.62s)]
*  You know, you go around the league like what if Sacramento wanted to make some crazy bid for him with DeRozan and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=112.86s)]
*  Keegan Murray and a first-round pick? Well, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=117.58s)]
*  you know, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=120.38000000000001s)]
*  do you want DeRozan's contract for the next couple years after what we've seen from him this season? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=121.58s)]
*  So you just look through the league and you can't find the trade and I think that was the situation Miami was in. Houston was [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=126.30000000000001s)]
*  the one team that made sense [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=131.98000000000002s)]
*  and it just didn't seem like they were interested in him. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=134.14000000000001s)]
*  So I think Riley is trying to flip this. The narrative is so strong that something was going to happen [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=136.14s)]
*  that he went the other way and he was like, no, he's going to be here the whole season. So now Jimmy knows he can't go anywhere. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=142.05999999999997s)]
*  So if he could really just blow this up now, that's not great for him. That's going to make teams less [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=148.61999999999998s)]
*  less excited to sign him in the summer. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=154.06s)]
*  It could veer the other way where now Jimmy's like, well if I'm going to be here, I might as well make the best of it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=157.26s)]
*  He could start playing better. Other stuff might happen. There might be some teams. Some star might get hurt. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=162.46s)]
*  Some situation might go sideways and then Miami in the early February can go, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=167.26s)]
*  hey listen, we didn't think we were going to trade him. We thought he was going to be here all year, but then this offer happened [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=172.78s)]
*  and they cover their bases. But [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=178.38s)]
*  Pat Riley, he's, you know, he's, I think he's late 70s, early 80s now. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=181.5s)]
*  It's like that old Seinfeld joke when old people are just like, fuck it [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=186.38s)]
*  and they just start backing out of the driveway and they don't, they don't care if somebody's coming. I'm backing out of the driveway. Here I come. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=190.3s)]
*  Pat Riley's been at that point for a while and it's really fun to watch somebody like that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=196.70000000000002s)]
*  run an NBA team. He had obviously had it with these other trade rumors and just was like, you know what? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=201.10000000000002s)]
*  There's no good trade for this guy. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=207.10000000000002s)]
*  We're keeping him. Here's my statement. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=209.10000000000002s)]
*  And it was old school and I kind of loved it, but this soap opera is probably not over. Joe House is here. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=212.14000000000001s)]
*  It's a stripped down BS podcast this week, you know, two pods this week. We did something for YouTube. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=217.9s)]
*  We put some million dollar picks up there. A lot of sports yesterday during Christmas Day. How'd you handle the family? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=222.94s)]
*  Christmas Day, how to consume sports while also pretending to be a family member part of Christmas. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=229.18s)]
*  Well, the nice thing is my family tradition, we get together with my parents in the house we grew up with. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=234.3s)]
*  Yeah, and with my brothers, my sister. I've stayed in the attic of that house many times. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=239.74s)]
*  You have. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=244.22s)]
*  And so we just do that the first part of the day. So we were done by kickoff one o'clock. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=246.14000000000001s)]
*  And when we got home, my wife and my kid wanted to play with his stuff. My wife went right back to bed. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=251.18s)]
*  And so I was left alone to watch whatever I wanted to watch. I had full control of the dial with Netflix. Great job Netflix. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=256.3s)]
*  Not great job by the games, but [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=264.46000000000004s)]
*  the broadcast was fine. And then NBA had a really good day. I was thinking though, the Wimby Knicks game was so good. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=267.42s)]
*  And I was just thinking big picture about, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=274.14000000000004s)]
*  you know, there's been so much what's wrong with the NBA stuff and some of it's founded. Some of it's stuff [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=277.34000000000003s)]
*  we've been complaining about forever. And then some of it is [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=281.82s)]
*  real issues, which is basically how do you find these under 30 American stars that people are going to give a shit about like they care about Steph and LeBron? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=285.02000000000004s)]
*  And yet the Steph LeBron thing last night was the solution and the problem at the same time. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=294.06s)]
*  Because it was the same thing for the Olympics too, right? It was awesome watching those guys. Hey the old guys, look at it. They still got it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=298.62s)]
*  But it's still coming at the expense of everybody else. Like even yesterday, it's in that eight o'clock. It's in the it's in the best spot. It's after football's over. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=306.86s)]
*  And that's the signature game. And it's basically two 500 teams. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=315.26s)]
*  And it's guys that have been in the league since [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=319.18s)]
*  2003 and 2009 respectively. And yet OKC wasn't on Christmas Day. Yannis wasn't on Christmas Day. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=321.8s)]
*  Wemby was buried at the beginning of the day. And this is like you're kind of doing this to yourself. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=328.3s)]
*  But at the same time I get it because Steph and LeBron was awesome. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=333.1s)]
*  So I don't really know what the answer is. It's like you could you could go glass half full glass half empty on it. But [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=336.62s)]
*  the fact that the Steph LeBron game was so good and sucked up so much oxygen from the day [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=342.14000000000004s)]
*  is actually kind of part of the problem. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=347.66s)]
*  Well, this is the the sort of predicament for the rest of the season. I mean, this is what happens when you're in a transition [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=350.46000000000004s)]
*  moment and the most resonant stars and this is the the the Olympics [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=357.82000000000005s)]
*  really [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=363.5s)]
*  you know validates the idea of putting those guys on the main stage because the Olympics were effing incredible. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=364.46000000000004s)]
*  Right those last two games the semi-finals and the finals were incredible and it was because of those guys. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=370.06s)]
*  So if you want to let them have their [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=374.78000000000003s)]
*  you know their their [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=377.58000000000004s)]
*  retirement journey, which is really what we're on. I think with LeBron and you know, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=379.08000000000004s)]
*  This is probably it. He looks better since the eight day sabbatical. Well, he got that who wouldn't. Curry looked great. Yeah [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=384.62s)]
*  Well, you say this is the journey we on though. Like I still go back and I talked about this a couple weeks ago [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=391.66s)]
*  but like the Olympics are a chance to showcase some of the younger guys and give them [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=396.3s)]
*  some new memories that they can [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=401.34000000000003s)]
*  they can make a foundation of our experience with them as superstars and yet [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=403.74s)]
*  that those moments went to the old guys Christmas still going to the old guys and I just think [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=408.38000000000005s)]
*  They're stuck in the middle. I remember when we were in college in the early 90s [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=413.02000000000004s)]
*  This transition felt a lot more organic to the mj barkley hakeem [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=417.58000000000004s)]
*  Drexler all the all the stockton and malone shonkamp gp. It just felt like it was organically shifting generations [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=423.32s)]
*  It doesn't feel as organic this time around [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=430.22s)]
*  Well only because we don't have an american superstar that's jumping up and grabbing the ring [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=432.54s)]
*  The guy that's jumped up and grabbed the ring is effing wemby. He served notice 12 noon madison square garden [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=437.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah christmas day [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=444.46s)]
*  Welcome to you know the the world like we everybody's been talking about wemby last season this season [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=446.06s)]
*  He keeps having these, you know inspiring milestone performances right out of the gate [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=452.3s)]
*  And yet, you know the mother effort was flopping [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=458.21999999999997s)]
*  On monday, I know we got to go [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=461.5s)]
*  Joyland b got kicked out and drummond got kicked out and drummond got pulled back in the game [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=463.98s)]
*  I mean if we're gonna you know [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=468.38s)]
*  We need a guy who's gonna come out and kick ass and and not fall over when the wind blows. Well, he is french [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=470.38s)]
*  That's part of the problem [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=477.82s)]
*  It's literally part of the problem. Well wemby I was talking about this with uh vann and a couple other people on text this week [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=479.66s)]
*  wemby has two things going against him that historically has not been great for [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=485.74s)]
*  Somebody really captivating the american public one. He's tall [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=491.34s)]
*  Tall people in our lifetime. It's never really totally worked. It's hard to identify with centers [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=495.26s)]
*  You know, it's why shak shak's a one-of-one [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=501.26s)]
*  Yeah, but even shak we were there in the 90s shak was pretty polarizing in the 90s, right people were [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=504.62s)]
*  Well, he was a huge superstar. He put up huge stats, but and also a while charismatic [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=510.85999999999996s)]
*  I mean he was but it took a while. I really feel like it was the three at lakers titles [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=517.18s)]
*  That was like, all right shacks arrived [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=523.26s)]
*  But remember there was like the 96 olympics like some of the movies he did some of the rap albums like he the lakers under achieved [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=525.02s)]
*  Maybe I know but did you feel like he was the most popular guy in the league? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=533.02s)]
*  I didn't like it was mj's league and then mj retired and we were like who's gonna be next and [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=536.8599999999999s)]
*  I don't think anyone thought the answer was shak [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=541.9s)]
*  Well, you know shak understood this which is why he went to la and it was shack and kobe and that was an [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=544.38s)]
*  Unbelievable era [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=549.24s)]
*  Yeah, but that the point is shak. So shacks probably become the closest [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=550.86s)]
*  But it's usually a perimeter guy [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=555.26s)]
*  Sure that becomes that's why like that aj devanza. Anyway, the wemby thing he's got that and he's got the foreign thing [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=557.26s)]
*  Which is another huge thing [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=563.5s)]
*  You know, we've we've never really seen a foreign guy [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=565.5s)]
*  Become captivate [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=569.4200000000001s)]
*  This country we can see worldwide. It might be great. Who is the most popular? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=571.34s)]
*  Who would you say is the most popular? I mean you're the you're the historian [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=575.74s)]
*  Well, he came I think was the best [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=580.62s)]
*  Foreign player of all time, right? Okay. Sure derk [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=583.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, right there. Yannis is in there yokage. Yes. Yes [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=587.26s)]
*  Yeah [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=591.4200000000001s)]
*  None of them were face of the leagues [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=592.7s)]
*  Nocage right now is on the best offensive heater this decade of anyone in a long time and nobody I mean part of that is [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=594.7800000000001s)]
*  he's not Mr personable, but [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=600.86s)]
*  Yeah, it'll be interesting to see with wemby [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=604.3000000000001s)]
*  We've just never seen it like we we've watched a lot of centers come into the league since we've loved this league [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=605.9000000000001s)]
*  Walton was probably that one and we were kids when that happened [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=611.0200000000001s)]
*  But when walton and the blazers that felt like felt like he was the face of the league for a year [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=614.3000000000001s)]
*  But kareem never resonated [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=618.46s)]
*  Uh, we watched ewing come in it just kind of never happened for him [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=620.62s)]
*  He also wasn't like amazingly fun to watch samson had a blip [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=623.6600000000001s)]
*  And then it just wasn't gonna happen with him and you go on and on it just centers are tough [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=628.22s)]
*  Howard [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=632.94s)]
*  yow [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=634.22s)]
*  Yeah, well yow was incredible and beloved, you know by global. Yeah [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=635.58s)]
*  He became great. Yeah, I think what the the thing that'll tilt it for wemby is if he keeps just having crazy games like the one yesterday [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=641.98s)]
*  He's gonna just have these 40.10 block like he's in the playoffs and [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=650.86s)]
*  You know, he's putting up like 40 15 if it's just stuff we've never seen before that might actually work [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=656.14s)]
*  But it's gonna take a while [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=662.5400000000001s)]
*  Needs to be on that national stage [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=664.38s)]
*  You know we had them as uh [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=666.38s)]
*  We I think did you go under for them before I went under yeah, I went under I just we've you know [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=668.94s)]
*  I I look at that roster even today [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=673.4200000000001s)]
*  under like there is this [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=676.3000000000001s)]
*  There aren't guys on that roster that make me say oh, yeah [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=678.4599999999999s)]
*  This is a 500 team that's going to be threatening for the [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=680.8599999999999s)]
*  You know, they're going to be in the play-in mix and they're going to be potentially fighting for an eight seed [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=684.06s)]
*  I look at that roster and I don't get there [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=688.38s)]
*  They're an 11 seed [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=690.62s)]
*  But they're 15 and 15 in a really hard conference, right? And [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=692.62s)]
*  There's a feistiness they play defense. They play they have a guy who's not afraid of whoever the other team star is and [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=696.9399999999999s)]
*  Um, I i'm prepared to chuck that up to a loss that san antonio thing. I think they'll get over [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=704.14s)]
*  35 and they also [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=709.5s)]
*  There's trade possibilities with them, too [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=711.4200000000001s)]
*  You know that I mean there was a lot of the darren fox stuff started last weekend [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=714.62s)]
*  It really shouldn't started a month ago [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=718.62s)]
*  You know, he's this year [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=721.0200000000001s)]
*  He's a free agent after next year [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=723.58s)]
*  the team feels like the the rosen thing just [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=726.22s)]
*  It's not happening they tried started thinking of fox and the fox stuff is so much more enticing [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=729.82s)]
*  For teams like houston and san antonio than jimmy butler jimmy butler is 35 [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=735.66s)]
*  He's been unhappy the whole year fox is a different animal like that's like [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=740.38s)]
*  If you're houston and you could turn fred bambliet and your picks and terry is in a fox like you're doing it if you're san antonio [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=744.3000000000001s)]
*  And you have a chance to add fox to your mix and you think you can resign them and put him with wemby and castle [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=751.58s)]
*  And some of your swings and you just give up the the pick strobe you have like you you're probably thinking about that [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=757.4200000000001s)]
*  But this is to get a top 15 guy who's a point guard who's in his prime [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=762.7s)]
*  This is about as interesting of a trade piece as we've had not counting like when dorant suddenly becomes available [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=767.1s)]
*  but [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=772.94s)]
*  a younger guy on his way up like [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=773.74s)]
*  I don't know you're thinking for dc [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=776.38s)]
*  We trade all your picks no five picks the jordan pool plus seven swaps. Oh, no [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=778.7s)]
*  It makes no sense whatsoever and I also really sort of wonder about fox [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=784.54s)]
*  to san antonio because [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=789.26s)]
*  It's like where are you? Where is it? Where do you get this season? Where are you next season? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=791.82s)]
*  It's it's a decade play. It's not a this season play as much as uh, we now have a guy [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=796.3000000000001s)]
*  We need a we need a perimeter guy preferably a guard [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=802.7s)]
*  Somebody who can handle his business run the team playoff wemby who's like a clear awesome number two [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=806.62s)]
*  I mean fox is about he's a top 20 player. That's about as good of a number two as you're gonna get [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=813.02s)]
*  Right and he's available [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=817.9799999999999s)]
*  Potentially if I was the kings, I wouldn't trade him. I would be like no we're not we're keeping you. Sorry [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=820.04s)]
*  And that makes more sense honestly because they're still right in the thick of things playoff wise mean, you know [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=825.9s)]
*  For sure. They have a they have a de rosa issue though [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=831.5799999999999s)]
*  I I think they they might have bought a car that they might have the odometer was turned back on [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=833.9799999999999s)]
*  And [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=839.58s)]
*  Happens sometimes it was like I thought this car had 95 000 miles on it. Maybe it was 195 000 [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=842.0600000000001s)]
*  Where are we? I don't mean to derail it. Where are we this week in jimmy butler? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=849.34s)]
*  I think he'd be gone already if there was a trade [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=853.1800000000001s)]
*  I just don't think there's a trade and that the most notable thing that seems to have happened the last [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=855.4200000000001s)]
*  Couple maybe the last week or so is that houston doesn't seem interested in him. Hmm [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=860.38s)]
*  Like they're like we're good [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=865.82s)]
*  Hmm, that is interesting because washington is out there auditioning players valentunis [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=867.58s)]
*  brogdon [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=873.96s)]
*  Copy, we can't get on the floor [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=875.1800000000001s)]
*  Uh, yeah, I don't kuzma being in any trade rumors is hilarious. You've been watching him [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=877.5s)]
*  I don't know what his trade value is, but i'm guessing it's low. No, it's it's it's high because he has an incredible contract [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=883.74s)]
*  He was like, you know what just a few years 20 million bucks sounds great [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=891.1s)]
*  Man to the incredible contract that he signed [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=895.42s)]
*  So he's very valuable if you can get a version out of him and get him to be committed to playing [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=898.4599999999999s)]
*  If you can get a version out of him that hasn't existed for two years [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=904.78s)]
*  Yeah, so the warriors have been mentioned with butler [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=908.8599999999999s)]
*  And I just I don't know what the point is house because [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=911.7399999999999s)]
*  I just don't know if that's making a huge difference for them [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=915.0999999999999s)]
*  You can talk yourself in a curry dream on a butler the old guys. Let's make a run [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=917.66s)]
*  But I I just think the league's too good. They started out strong [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=921.5s)]
*  They've gone the other way [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=925.3399999999999s)]
*  They have a lot of like tradeable pieces that have the minutes are all over the place buddy healed now all of a sudden scores five points [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=926.62s)]
*  a game [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=933.18s)]
*  Podzemski is in the same asset. So I I don't I don't know why miami would want their stuff or want to pay kaminga [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=934.14s)]
*  However much I don't know what else [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=940.78s)]
*  You had you had under for them, right? I had under for them and it's because you know, they they [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=944.06s)]
*  had [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=950.4599999999999s)]
*  Pieces that they added in the offseason that were supposed to create depth and you know melting got hurt and yeah [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=951.98s)]
*  But none of the pieces really moved the needle. Oh buddy. He was only it's it's a shocker buddy [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=957.58s)]
*  He was only averaging five points [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=961.98s)]
*  Like he couldn't stick in in in philly different needs. Yeah, philly needs a guy that could score from the perimeter [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=964.7s)]
*  Uh, I feel like the golden state situation, you know [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=971.74s)]
*  It requires what we got with the christmas game [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=974.78s)]
*  Which was stef curry scoring eight points in 26 seconds and right and then they lose on a layup [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=977.18s)]
*  And it wasn't just like a hard fight reeves. It was ola. It was ola defense. My man got right to come on [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=983.3399999999999s)]
*  Come on, so they are where they are [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=989.9s)]
*  Yeah, and there's a I think we talked about this before the year when we were trying to figure it over anders with the west [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=992.9399999999999s)]
*  There were so many good teams [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=998.3s)]
*  Some teams were just gonna end up not being happy and right now it's sacramento and it's golden state [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1001.26s)]
*  And san antonio is a little better than we thought [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1006.38s)]
*  Denver is a little worse than we thought minnesota is a little worse than we thought [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1008.78s)]
*  But we knew it was going to be some at the nfl was way more easy to figure out this year [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1011.5s)]
*  I think than the mba the celtics you went under I went over [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1015.5s)]
*  And I am not going to [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1019.1s)]
*  Overreact to anything with the celtics yet [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1021.58s)]
*  Um, you were on it a little more about how hard it is to repeat that was part of your under case, right? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1024.22s)]
*  Just in terms of like bringing that energy they there was you know [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1030.54s)]
*  All their core guys went to the olympics except for jalen brown who wasn't invited [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1034.86s)]
*  But you know like going from the finals to the olympics to an nba regular season [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1038.7s)]
*  And 58 wins in this era is still like excellent [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1044.54s)]
*  So if they win 58 games and they certainly can [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1047.98s)]
*  I still win my bet at 58 and a half to 59 and a half whatever the the total was [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1051.1s)]
*  But it's just hard. It's a slog and I don't begrudge them, you know sort of going through [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1055.74s)]
*  Peaks and valleys over the course of a regular season knock on wood. There'll be uh, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1060.7s)]
*  plenty healthy [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1065.42s)]
*  Come april and really the only thing that was interesting to me in terms of a regular season outcome is like is tatum [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1066.7s)]
*  Going to put himself into that mvp conversation. Is this the right moment for that even? Yeah [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1073.58s)]
*  Well, so glass half full tatum and brown are healthy [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1079.02s)]
*  Athletically physically they seem great brown's little hero. Bolly this year. Their shooting stats are down with him a little [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1083.08s)]
*  I haven't loved that [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1090.22s)]
*  Um, there's little stuff I don't love but nothing i'm super concerned about like they lost orlando on monday [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1091.58s)]
*  This depleted zombie magic team [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1098.06s)]
*  Orlando played great. I watched the game like the seltziks tried hard. They played well orlando just played awesome [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1100.94s)]
*  They made big shots. They they were super feisty. They were really fighting and it was a really good game [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1107.02s)]
*  It was an okay loss the philly game yesterday [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1111.74s)]
*  Um that was philly treated like a game seven [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1114.94s)]
*  They came in they really wanted to prove something they couldn't have played harder [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1118.54s)]
*  And the seltziks couldn't match it and you know, i'm not i'm not weird about that either. I think [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1123.5s)]
*  White's has been the same all month [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1129.4199999999998s)]
*  Holiday was hurt porzingis keeps getting these dumb little injuries pritchard sometimes just doesn't show up yesterday. He sucked [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1131.74s)]
*  Um, i'm not going to really evaluate the seltziks team until the west coast trip next month. That's all we'll know [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1139.1799999999998s)]
*  All right, that's one we'll have a feeling for them. I don't love that. They're four back from the calves, but uh [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1145.1s)]
*  But yeah, that's so those are the big mba storylines to me is just muhawki's better [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1152.1399999999999s)]
*  Like muhawki, I think has moved back into contender ish [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1157.98s)]
*  Kind of feeling denver clearly needs to do something and I don't know what the fix is for them [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1161.58s)]
*  um [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1166.46s)]
*  Phoenix I guess is the one kind of what's going on with this team [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1167.5s)]
*  That we thought was a contender and I just say it just seems like they have the worst centers in the league and they [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1171.74s)]
*  Can't keep these guys in the same court. But uh [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1176.3s)]
*  But for the most part, I don't think there's been any any major surprises this year other than [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1179.5s)]
*  Minnesota being as bad as as they've been even though they won yesterday [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1184.6s)]
*  Yeah, and they they may figure it out. They won yesterday because you know, luca went out and the [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1188.4599999999998s)]
*  When he went out and he's going to be out for an extended stretch [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1193.1s)]
*  Which is not concerning but you know the west the thing that that makes it super hard for the teams [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1196.06s)]
*  We're talking about your lakers your denver your golden state warriors your minnesota timberwolves [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1200.54s)]
*  Is the early good performance by memphis the early good performance by the clippers and the uh, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1206.46s)]
*  And he's somewhat exactly are anticipated. We all liked houston. I'm surprised did anybody take the uh, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1213.82s)]
*  houston over as a lock you I think you and racila both did oh great job [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1219.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the surprises were houston memphis quippers [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1224.62s)]
*  And then uh, just san antonio being a 500 team i'm still not [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1227.66s)]
*  If it's okay, i'm still a little dubious to the clippers. They're only 17 and 13 [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1233.02s)]
*  Yeah, they're only 17 and 13 and they put a lot on harden [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1239.02s)]
*  I also think the way the nba did this nba cup schedule combined with the christmas schedule [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1242.7s)]
*  which hey [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1248.38s)]
*  Newsflash i'm going to criticize the nba again. I just think they've completely mangled all of this [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1250.14s)]
*  Like why aren't there christmas eve games? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1254.86s)]
*  Why are they just punting on a day where there's no sports? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1257.02s)]
*  Why are they punting on these days when there's clearly no sports when instead of like they load up the monday? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1259.26s)]
*  There's like 14 games on monday. You can't even watch them keep track anything and then tuesday nothing [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1264.94s)]
*  um [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1270.3s)]
*  It is weird because christmas eve is like such an underrated night [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1271.18s)]
*  I went out to dinner and the place we went to was f-ing popping [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1274.94s)]
*  Right butts to nuts packed from one when you walked in the bar is packed like [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1278.94s)]
*  People want to be out and and an nba game have a couple games at a bar to go with your family [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1283.82s)]
*  You know go with your family to an nba game and then uh, then dinner whatever [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1288.86s)]
*  Yeah, kind of weird [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1292.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so the reason i bring that up with the cuppers [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1294.6999999999998s)]
*  The way they've structured this december thing. I think it's been good for the old guys [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1298.06s)]
*  You know like people like lebron hardin curry. You're not playing like four and seven. You're not playing [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1303.1s)]
*  Five and eight you're not uh, you're not having these back-to-backs [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1309.02s)]
*  You're not nursing these little injuries because you're not playing that much basketball, but now we're about to hit this stretch [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1312.38s)]
*  Especially when we get to january [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1318.14s)]
*  Where the schedule just gets really hard and it's going to advantage the young guys [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1320.3000000000002s)]
*  It's going to advantage a team like san antonio that has wemby and castle and vasel and all these young dudes [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1323.66s)]
*  And I think it's going to hurt a team like the clippers because the amount of [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1329.66s)]
*  The amount of offensive responsibility they're putting on harden [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1333.66s)]
*  I don't know if it's sustainable once we get into these 16 games in 29 days kind of [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1336.94s)]
*  Territory before february so i'm watching that. I think it's good for teams like oklahoma city houston [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1342.84s)]
*  Memphis even a team like the south x that are built around two younger guys cleveland, you know [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1348.86s)]
*  Um, but then you look at a team like orlando 19 and 12 [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1354.06s)]
*  But really depleted and once you're depleted and you get into these schedule things [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1358.22s)]
*  Kind of a nightmare muhawkia. It's good for because yanis is an alien [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1363.5s)]
*  Um atlanta it's good for because they're built around all these young guys indiana a team that we bet on earlier this week [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1367.42s)]
*  Um, I think it's good for them. So anyway, I would I would watch out [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1374.22s)]
*  Um, if you had to pick a final, so who would it be? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1378.54s)]
*  boston oklahoma city [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1381.74s)]
*  Yeah, I haven't waived on that either to move off of it [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1383.26s)]
*  Yeah [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1386.06s)]
*  Any did philly do anything yesterday that that intrigued you big picture or do you just you're just not going to take it seriously [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1386.38s)]
*  No, I I do take it seriously and it does intrigue me [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1392.7s)]
*  They're like fighting hard to get an identity and that level of of like competitiveness that they showed against the south sticks [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1395.26s)]
*  It was good. Yeah, seven and three over their last 10. There's still the net differential still isn't great [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1403.82s)]
*  Um, but they're you know, still yeah minus four net differential, but they're like they're pushing in the right direction if they could just get [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1410.06s)]
*  You know two of those three guys healthy for a stretch of time [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1417.74s)]
*  All all every time all three of them play it's it's an absolute bonus [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1421.3400000000001s)]
*  But I they're headed towards I could see them rip something off in january be right around 500 [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1424.94s)]
*  And then as like february turns into march, there are a couple games above and then they're like a real formidable playoff though [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1430.54s)]
*  well [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1437.26s)]
*  We'll see because they have [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1438.3s)]
*  I mean they have a pretty they have a wet they have a west coast trip coming up [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1440.54s)]
*  And then a whole bunch of games in january. I mean they just in january from january 1st to the 19th [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1444.46s)]
*  They have 11 games and that's not counting two games at the end of december, too [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1450.78s)]
*  So, you know the wheel they're constructing there's no way and bids gonna play more than half of those games. I would assume [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1455.02s)]
*  I don't love what i've seen from paul george. I'd like to throw my voice into that chorus [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1460.54s)]
*  Uh just doesn't look as comfortable. He doesn't seem 100 healthy to me. So I want to wait a month on that but [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1465.82s)]
*  Uh competitively they looked really good. I the caleb martin is just like a celtics killer at this point [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1471.4199999999998s)]
*  I don't know what what it is about boston, but he rises to the occasion on it [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1477.02s)]
*  So their season looked at now. They're 11 and 17 the problem for them is they have no room for error [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1481.18s)]
*  That's right. You know no more margin for error at all [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1486.7s)]
*  Yeah, like that like one more maxi three week ankle sprain or imbib goes out for a month and all of a sudden [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1489.26s)]
*  you're looking at like the 10th playoff spot because [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1496.22s)]
*  There's teams like chicago and detroit haven't really gone away and I don't know if those are trade teams or not. Everyone thinks chicago is [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1498.78s)]
*  But I don't they're not gonna be able to trade levine who's taking levine at that money [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1505.6599999999999s)]
*  And he's playing hard enough somebody desperate enough. So maybe it's vusovich [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1509.6599999999999s)]
*  sure [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1514.06s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know i'm trying to think how they could hurt themselves [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1515.4199999999998s)]
*  It would be trading one of those two guys your denver and golden states, right? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1518.4599999999998s)]
*  Those kinds of situations where it's like one last gasp [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1522.6999999999998s)]
*  Let's see if we can do it or more. Maybe the lakers if the lakers keep scuffling around 500 [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1525.9799999999998s)]
*  They still have that one trade piece with the one thing that's happened one thing [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1530.78s)]
*  That's a little different with the lakers is max christy who looked like a zero [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1534.22s)]
*  He's actually been pretty good for them [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1539.02s)]
*  For the last couple weeks. He's been okay. He's been passable. They can play him in crunch time [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1541.5800000000002s)]
*  He might actually make an open shot [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1546.22s)]
*  He can play defense a little bit, but it's it's something they didn't have a month ago. Anyway [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1548.46s)]
*  You [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMGR97gN_Q&t=1560.7s)]
