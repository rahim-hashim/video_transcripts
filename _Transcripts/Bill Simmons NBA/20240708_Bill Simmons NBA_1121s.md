# Does the NBA Care Too Much About Parity? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [July 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jv9wVsHyKWE)
*  I don't know the league is super deep you look at these teams you're like wow
*  That's a nine seed you look at Miami and they have BAM and Jimmy Butler, and I don't feel like they're
*  Potentially a top a playoff team. We'll see what happens with them. What are you?
*  You know, we stay on this though. I want to stay because it was something that you said without me and
*  you basically were saying this version of the NBA isn't as exciting and
*  Granted you're gonna get a ton of grief because it felt like you were already worried about the tax implications of all the Celtics contracts
*  And that with these new restrictions if I'm hearing you right
*  That now the league has too much parity and then that turned into the NFL you think being more fun than the NBA
*  So I wanted I want to stay on that with you because we haven't even talked about it off the air
*  Yeah, the thing that the thing that I said last week was I
*  Don't like that teams that do everything right somehow still get penalized
*  But that's the part I don't get like if you draft your own stars if you make smart trades
*  you still get screwed and
*  The thing and I guess Zack is I was texting with Zack about apparently he wrote a piece in 2018
*  about how to take care of franchise guys with the luxury tax and
*  You know if you have curry for 15 years should curry count full boat on your luxury tax or should he count?
*  70% I just wish the league rewarded
*  teams for continuity
*  Which they just don't they don't care. I think they I think this is what they want. I think they love when it's like
*  Crazy June crazy July crazy February people hopping around. I think the agents like it
*  I think the money gets dispersed in a different way and everybody's spending it and I don't like it as much
*  Like I think what we had and this is what I said the other day like what we had when
*  Clay's leaving the words
*  It was a big deal partly because he played there for 13 years and him and curry and Draymond
*  Lasted together that long and that's what we're giving up with this new apron stuff. I don't think it's possible to keep teams
*  What is okay? See you gonna do four years from now
*  You that like let's say they have like a really nice run here with Chet and with
*  SGA and with Jalen Williams and some of their young guys. They're not gonna be able to keep that together
*  So that's just the league we've we've stumbled into is just the short bursts of having a team. That's good for three four
*  Maybe five years, but if you really stumble into something great, you can't keep it and I don't think that's right
*  Yeah, but you're suggesting that if it's really something great that it could have staying power for longer than five years
*  And I don't really know that we've had a ton of examples of anything lasting longer
*  Maybe the player on the team like a magic or a Jordan. Yeah, it's two people or three and then the supporting cast changes around
*  So Golden State had the three guys that managed to stay together
*  Boston has Tatum and Brown now heading into year eight and year nine together
*  Okay, see we'll potentially have their guys hanging together for a while, but that's you really talking about a nucleus
*  That's a little smaller like the Celtics
*  It's take it's really about Tatum and Brown, right?
*  Ultimately, that'll be what makes that special everybody else will kind of move in and out of their orbit, but it's those two guys
*  That'll be what lasts
*  And I'm worried they're not gonna be able to keep that but the league probably has more parity. We have six straight different champs
*  Yeah, Lee has more parity than the NFL does right now
*  True well the NFL there's more the what six quarterbacks I feel like you're your defensive turning me I
*  Think the NFL has more parity than the NBA
*  You don't think?
*  Like the NBA has the ability to have I don't think it does
*  I don't think it does the NFL has the ability to have like the Packers just jump
*  Yes, seven wins in a year. The NBA doesn't have that. Yes, because the turnover is usually more than anything else
*  Yeah, I think sometimes I'll I used to play for the NBA
*  Sometimes I'll I used to fall for it like a new coach could come in and everything and it's like, okay
*  Well last year there were minus 12 and turnovers and this year there were plus 10
*  Then we acted like they were a completely different team
*  I mean that's kind of what that word is part of it is you're sitting there going
*  How is this team that was up 21 to 3?
*  Trying to hold off this team that's down eight points at the very end. It's like oh because there were a couple turnovers
*  I don't know that it means the product there's less possessions and all this stuff
*  But when I when I watched what you were talking about it wasn't that I was like you're totally wrong
*  I think we actually have to see how the second apron plays out here a little bit and we're in a stretch of parity with
*  Basketball, which is I thought what people didn't like about basketball where there weren't enough teams
*  It was just the same teams over and over again
*  Especially when you go through the teens of LeBron with the Heaton in Cleveland up against the Golden State machine
*  Like that was that was a criticism even though more people watched it
*  The criticism was how what's the point the season hasn't even started yet?
*  It's gonna be Golden State in Cleveland the NBA finals and for the most part
*  That's what we got for a really long stretch
*  So now that we're not we're gonna have that happen a lot less likely in theory because I still think some of this stuff plays
*  Out you're like hey wow that's crazy the guys that are the five best players in the league are still winning all the titles
*  How different is it really yeah, but I think I think it's more parody. I know but I think you're missing the point of
*  Like what your argument is that I cared about yeah, because you talk about like yeah my homes burrow
*  In the NFL there's what six seven teams that we kind of know are gonna be in the mix every year as long as
*  The supporting cast is good
*  But they're all attached to specific cities, and they don't leave the cities in the NFL right like Brady was with the Patriots for 20
*  Years even Dak Prescott's been in Dallas for 10 my homes is gonna be in the Chiefs his whole career
*  Joe burrows gonna be in the Bengals his whole career you go on down the line
*  The infrastructure is really the quarterback and the franchise and maybe the coach too in the NBA
*  I think what's what shifting is?
*  Are we gonna have that quarterback kind of possibilities with the rosters whereas like like the Celtics Tatum and Brown together the quarterback
*  With the Warriors it was curry and clay forever were kind of the quarterback of that
*  Milwaukee was Yanis and whatever infrastructure you could put around it, but Yanis is probably gonna be the next one who wants to leave I
*  Like when the guys stay in the same cities I like that to me
*  That's the most important thing if you have a best guy that you've rooted for forever
*  I don't think you should have to be worried the guy's gonna take off like that
*  It should be a situation where that guy and whoever like his best teammate was or whatever
*  Then that should be what you get to watch for more than four or five years
*  And I think the NBA is now risking that in a real way with the second apron stuff
*  They're just gonna make the sub you think that Jalen Brown is gonna be on the Celtics in four years like I really don't know
*  Which seems insane those guys tire together what 13 years in yeah, the likelihood is not gonna be on Celtics anymore
*  But this is depressing right, but if it's Tatum and Brown
*  Maybe that's the way like you just said it
*  So I'm not presenting this to you as if you didn't think of it because yeah back to your original point
*  It was why penalized this is almost more about an Oklahoma City discussion than it is even a Celtics discussion at this point
*  But that's kind of what it's always been discussion. I know I just I was just having fun with you on that
*  But but that's what it turned into what about you okay? Jim Murray. That's another one
*  Right, but you'll kitchen Murray will always be able to work out the problem is they paid Aaron Gordon so much money
*  They paid Michael Porter jr. You want to talk about doing a deal like sight unseen especially with the injury red flags
*  You know look when you get a title nobody's really gonna care about it all that much
*  It's still probably gonna be the two guys
*  It may just be eliminating the third guy or the assumption you can always add the third guy and the third star things
*  I
*  Don't think you are I don't think you are if you have two really good guys
*  Are they gonna stay together I?
*  Hope not
*  You know what else though with the second apron and the analogy of using the past
*  It's like there's a reason why there's like when you're younger
*  It's good for you to have a credit limit
*  Even if you could probably afford have it be a little bit higher
*  Is that you're just gonna end up spending to the credit limit especially when you're younger at least for me when you're stupid
*  And you're just you know whatever you're not exactly hosting squawk box
*  so
*  The owners do the second apron thing to make sure that happens even though like what 14 of the last 16?
*  title winners or taxpayers Howard Beck did a really nice piece on the ringer that I
*  Encourage people to check out with all this stuff because even the players associations they were talking about the second apron
*  It's like wait isn't this kind of like limiting?
*  Some of the freewheeling spenders that you have here and the players association rep in the piece even said it's basically like two to
*  Three teams every year that would even have gone over the second apron
*  So it's not like it's limiting everything and then on top of the thing that's always important remind all of us is that whatever you
*  Think the second apron does in limiting spending and costing players money
*  It doesn't really because it's all part of the 51 49 percent split and that there are actually already is in theory a hard cap
*  The players are making 51 percent of all basketball related income. It's just what it is now I
*  do think that this is a player empowerment pivot on top of everything else because as this continues to play out and
*  There's going to be the guy that's a great player. That's like I want to go there
*  Figure it out. They'll have a rule book for those teams that are flirting with the second apron that go
*  We actually can't do it. We didn't want to do it before but we had to
*  Now I don't know that we can actually do it
*  Just there's no freedom the freedom of movement is limited in the way that we've seen in the past
*  So sure it's it saves the owners the taxpayers a ton of money compared to what they were doing before
*  Because they're just gonna be so incentivized to stay under it
*  But I think the player movement has a big part of it, which yeah would penalize
*  Ok, see if they had five guys
*  But I don't know that the Celtics are a really good example
*  Like it's so rare that they could have five guys like this all be this good at the same time all making this much money
*  Well, that's true. But I think with like let's look at San Antonio, right? Let's say Castle's really good
*  Let's say they nailed that pick he ends up being the best guy in the draft and let's say they get some awesome guy in
*  The 2026 draft let's say they get they stumble into AJ and then have wimpy and castle and AJ and then I don't know
*  So how it becomes Scottie Pippen naive the four guys. I don't see how you keep the four guys together
*  now the reason I was thinking about that to
*  frame the cost of a franchise players because
*  You know, that's something the NFL should probably have too and I've made the case for that too with them
*  Like if you have my homes and you've had my homes for ten years
*  Should he counting it's the salary cap in exactly the same way
*  You know, this is what happened with Brady with New England forever where he had to take discounts
*  Remember the last like what five six seven years where he took less money so they would allegedly right?
*  Yeah, they kind of fucked about it, but I don't know I just I like rewarding teams for ingenuity and continuity
*  And if we can't do that
*  I just think this is what the league's gonna become wherever every just guys bouncing around and maybe one guy is attached to the team
*  And that's it in football. It's different because you have if you have one of the six seven quarterbacks. They usually don't go anywhere
*  Right you like Matt Stafford switch teams
*  Cousins switch team like it now I'm already dropping down the cousins level
*  But if you have like one of the og guys those guys usually don't switch teams
*  They stay there forever and that becomes the continuity
*  But based on the thing you just laid out with spurs like what if they nail it? Okay
*  So what do they have like four all-stars for consistent all-stars all at the same time?
*  It doesn't really even happen the fourth guy wouldn't even have enough options to even be able to put up the numbers that go back
*  To the 80s Celtics and Lakers would how would those teams have stayed together?
*  like everyone romanticizes all those teams that they would have had to get rid of Mikhail and
*  Probably Danny age by like 1987 the Lakers
*  There's no chance they would have been able to keep worthy and Kareem and magic and Byron Scott like that team doesn't exist
*  So I just I hope people understand that that's where we're moving
*  You might get like for one year or two years like with the Celtic situation where you have like the five or six guys
*  But they're not gonna have that a year from now
*  Like that this is the last year for this group together, right?
*  So they have a chance to go back to back
*  But then after that they'll have to trade poor Zingas or they'll have to trade drew holiday
*  And maybe they'll even have to make two trades not one just to try to get under this second apron
*  So you cost them like 450 million have the team you think if they repeated with those guys under contract with the holiday extension done
*  And the thing that scared me about the prisingas trade wasn't so much who he was and what the number was is that they had to
*  Do the extension for him to pick up the player option?
*  Because that was all part of your next year, right?
*  Yeah, but it still was but next year three-year commitment
*  Yeah, it's a three-year commitment to somebody like presenting us with the injury history
*  So then you've got the Tatum deal that's gonna surpass the Brown deal that was historic and all these things that were but if they were to
*  win
*  Again or say like losing the NBA finals or something and everybody feels healthy and everybody likes what they're doing
*  I you think there's gonna break it up to avoid being a second apron
*  Second time offender and have their first round traffic moved to the back of the first round
*  Can you even like what are you really doing? It's that it's that repeater tax, right?
*  It would be the line up the whole rotation a year from now
*  I think would cost like 450 bucks of the tax or 450 million bucks with the tax. I
*  Just thought but I mean the trash crazy amount of money
*  The traffic part of it's irrelevant because if you're that good anyway, all the cities like oh no
*  We went from 29th to 30th like well, what do you think they should have done?
*  Like you like the second apron. No the second apron. Do you like this new system?
*  If my goal was I really when I when we first talked about it and then we I admit it I have to sometimes
*  It's like the bridges
*  Nick's Houston
*  Trades all together and just trying to map out all the draft picks being like do I have this right yet?
*  Or do I have this wrong as a five or is it six?
*  When there's new changes like this the CBA like I have to go over it a few times before I really realize it
*  And then I got to read like other people to see if there's stuff that I'm missing and then I usually sent Bobby
*  Marks a hundred texts
*  Of course the owners have to have something in place to prevent themselves from themselves
*  Because one of my favorite things ever when that hockey lockout happened in 04 and I was buddies with a bunch of guys that
*  I've gone to school with that played and
*  I just was like what's going on and like one of them just said we were just hanging out
*  He's like hey if it's that big of an issue stop paying us
*  Right and it's
*  Same thing they couldn't they couldn't stop themselves
*  Yeah, it's a really simple thing
*  But like if I were a player I'm going so what am I I'm supposed to give you back the hockey guys get destroyed in
*  That thing they had to give back like 25% of their contract
*  Yeah season they had like look at the Maple Leafs team
*  Spending and then what the first cap was verse verse what the Maple Leafs were actually
*  Versus what they were actually spending in the past you're like you're making that team that was spending that much and combined payroll go
*  Down to this number to have everybody else be able to catch up with them
*  And if you're a player you're going so you guys can't help yourselves, but it's our fucking fault
*  So like I philosophically just believe in that I just I believe in the player side of that
*  But the players are excuse me the owners can't help themselves so they have to put all these mechanisms in place
*  But I just think that the freedom of movement for the the Sun's the Sun's are gonna be this this test of
*  Scaring the shit out of all these other teams
*  Well that was basically
*  So you look back at Golden State a couple years ago
*  Which is the reason I think we have this second second apron to begin with because what was that time that would they spend like?
*  350 million on the roster and they just kept adding stuff taking on contracts
*  Lake up and ball over over four years Lake up and ball more Smith
*  And this is Bobby Marx's number of nine hundred and fifty million combined over four seasons
*  And that's why we have this rule now because of those two types
*  Yeah, people are like what the fuck man
*  How are we supposed to compete with this you're just you're just hemorrhaging money
*  You know care, but you but you want you like the Warriors though being able to keep everybody you well
*  They did what they did what it took to win the 22 title and it worked. I just feel like
*  I don't ever want to get to a situation where where we're redoing basically with the new rules
*  what just happened with clay and Draymond and
*  curry and clay's gone in like
*  2018
*  right and
*  You don't even get 20 even though the last few years of the clay experience wasn't that much fun
*  But I look at what's gonna happen with Boston like I don't I just really worried that Tatum and Brown are gonna retire as Celtics
*  Maybe one of them will but but with these new rules it almost seems inconceivable both will
*  Which I don't think is good for basketball
*  You know and if they can't figure out any sort of wrinkles to take to have teams
*  Take care of guys. They drafted smart things they did
*  I don't really understand what we're doing, but I would say that about football too
*  But we also had the same thing with OKC when it was hardened Durant Westbrook and Ibaka now they made a mistake
*  They could have wrote it out another year
*  They didn't really get back enough when they did the hardened trade hardened also was somebody we didn't realize was gonna become
*  This impactful as a one for a team because his role was diminished and you know good for him
*  Like there was a number that they offered him. No, they cheap down
*  They made a mistake six and a half million bucks. It has happened before I still I just feel like maybe you're overreacting to it
*  A little bit and that if you have two special players
*  You're gonna be able to keep the two guys together and I think the Celtics are a really rare case of like roster construction because
*  Go ahead
*  Now I worried Denver is the flip side of that though
*  That Denver's boss together
*  But if you make any mistake now, like you mentioned the Porter contract
*  Once you have the two guys if you make any mistake around those two guys, you almost can't recover
*  You know now Yoko Chimurri instead of playing with Caldwell Pope
*  They have to keep their fingers crossed that Peyton Watson can hit a corner three in round two
*  That's part of it
