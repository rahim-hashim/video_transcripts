# Can Zion Return to His Peak Fitness Level? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [December 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ)
*  We got to talk about the elephant in the room. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  So I had to. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=5.04s)]
*  It's funny you would use that euphemism. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=5.72s)]
*  Yeah, I was even no, no, no. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=7.88s)]
*  Very rude. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=10.28s)]
*  Listen, I don't, this is not a fat shaming situation. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=11.6s)]
*  Um, I don't like talking about other people's weight, but when you're a [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=16.16s)]
*  professional athlete and you're a max player and you're the most important [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  pick in the history of the franchise. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=22.8s)]
*  The Zion in person was stunning. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=25.36s)]
*  And I saw it on TV and in TV, you're like, you never know TV ads, 10 pounds. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=28.4s)]
*  He's just gigantic. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=33.76s)]
*  He's way out of shape and it doesn't totally affect him in the games because [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=35.08s)]
*  he still weirdly has this first step explosive miss. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=40.68s)]
*  He doesn't have the second jump anymore. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  Second jump's gone. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=44.92s)]
*  Um, but he's carrying too much weight. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=46.6s)]
*  And I thought that was a real disrespect with the way the Lakers even defended [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=48.8s)]
*  him because they were like, we're just playing seven feet off you. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=52.8s)]
*  You can't shoot threes. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=55.72s)]
*  He missed, I think five of the first six free throws. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=57.0s)]
*  They attacked him on defense. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=60.44s)]
*  He had a bunch of defensive lapses. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  And I look at, I like this Pelicans team. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=63.68s)]
*  It's two different teams. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=66.28s)]
*  There's the Zion team. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=67.32s)]
*  And then there's this other team I really want to see with Daniels and Murphy [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=69.52s)]
*  and, uh, you know, Brandon Ingram and Alvarado and McCollum and just like flying [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=74.2s)]
*  around kind of like Indiana and they can't fly to the field. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  And they can't fly around with Zion in this condition. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=82.2s)]
*  But Rob, I, Waz and I were just, well, Waz, I'll start with you. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=84.72s)]
*  We just, neither of us could believe it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  It was tough. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=92.84s)]
*  It was tough. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=93.72s)]
*  First, so they're doing the little handshake, hand clap after the anthem [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  thing and Zion kind of walks by us. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=99.64s)]
*  And I don't want to step on Bill's, you know, body language corner, but the guy [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  looked like he just woke up from a nap. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=106.64s)]
*  Like this is a big game, prom time. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=108.64s)]
*  Yeah, he looked out of it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=111.04s)]
*  The crowd is juiced. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=112.0s)]
*  There was legitimate juice and energy in the building by the time that game had [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=113.08000000000001s)]
*  started, like it was already there. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=117.0s)]
*  You know, it wasn't like the first game where folks were still trickling in six [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=119.4s)]
*  minutes into the first quarter, like the game was ready to go and Zion looked like [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=123.16000000000001s)]
*  he was still wiping the eye crust out of his eye. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  And I was like, Hmm, that's curious. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=130.72s)]
*  Then Bill pointed out to me, it was like, what happened to best shape of his career? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=132.6s)]
*  First serious off season, blah, blah, blah. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=138.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's long gone. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  It was just, it's not there. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=141.96s)]
*  Guys, I thought we had an understanding as a nation that between Thanksgiving and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  Christmas, we're not going to do this to each other. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=148.4s)]
*  Give the guy a break. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=153.52s)]
*  Um, listen, this is, it's, it's kind of sad. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=155.28s)]
*  I think it's a sad NBA story because at some point this, this isn't coming back. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=160.4s)]
*  Like, this is kind of what your body becomes. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=166.8s)]
*  Barkley's talked about this. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=168.88000000000002s)]
*  Barkley came into the league. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=170.20000000000002s)]
*  He was 300 pounds. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=171.52s)]
*  His first season on the Sixers, he was able to move around. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  He carried a lot of weight, but I think Barkley even said on my podcast last year, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=177.32000000000002s)]
*  it's like the problem with carrying this way, you can do it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=180.60000000000002s)]
*  You can cheat, you know, you can look like a version of yourself, but you're going to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=182.84s)]
*  get hurt because he's looks like Jaylen Carter. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  He looks like he should be playing nose tackle, you know, for the New Orleans [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=191.36s)]
*  Saints and it's just, it's irresponsible. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=195.48000000000002s)]
*  He's the franchise guy that made this huge commitment to him. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=198.64s)]
*  And it's like, get in shape. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=202.11999999999998s)]
*  Look around the league. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=203.16s)]
*  Look at all these dudes. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=204.16s)]
*  We just watch Howell-Burton. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  That guy is the most locked in possible. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=206.2s)]
*  And it's another young star who takes his shit seriously. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  And it doesn't seem like Zion does. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=213.2s)]
*  And Rob, I think they missed, I think they had a chance to trade him last summer. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=214.83999999999997s)]
*  Now I've also heard that there weren't a lot of people knocking on the door. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=219.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=222.76s)]
*  It's like, did they try? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=223.6s)]
*  Did they not? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=224.44s)]
*  It's, I remember I said something and it got aggregated. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=225.11999999999998s)]
*  It's like, Simmons says they're going to trade him by the end of the week. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=228.08s)]
*  It wasn't what I said. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  It was one person who said, who told me, Hey, don't be surprised that they [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=231.48000000000002s)]
*  trade Zion this week, that was it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=236.0s)]
*  But I think they might've missed their window now. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=238.04000000000002s)]
*  I don't know what you would get for him because it's a super expensive guy. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=240.12s)]
*  Why is we're going to do the worst contract strap at some point. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=243.64000000000001s)]
*  Super expensive guys, not in shape. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=246.52s)]
*  I've seen this play. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=248.68s)]
*  I'm old. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=249.60000000000002s)]
*  I've seen a lot of NBA seasons. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=250.12s)]
*  This never ends well. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=252.24s)]
*  So Rob, am I panicking or is this fair? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=253.8s)]
*  You're not panicking because once you make the decision to not trade him, and I'm [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=257.4s)]
*  sympathetic to that decision for the record, he's an impossible player to think [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=261.32s)]
*  about trading because he could burn you so, so badly if he gets his career on track. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=265.48s)]
*  But this is what the darker timeline looks like. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=270.36s)]
*  And Bill, you said, you know, it's not affecting him yet on the court, but it [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=273.36s)]
*  is affecting his role for one, like the Pelicans do not prioritize him in their [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=277.36s)]
*  offense because they can't trust him to one, be healthy and two, to have his wind [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=282.88s)]
*  at the end of games. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=287.48s)]
*  If you're going to him over and over and over, he was sucking it up. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=288.32s)]
*  We would, that was one of the things we noticed. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=291.88s)]
*  He's keeping possessions later. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=293.96s)]
*  He's sucking wind and then taking them back out. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=295.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=298.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=298.36s)]
*  Then he was playing like four or five minutes spurts. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=298.56s)]
*  It's fucking December. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  It's just so strange to see him to catch the ball on the move, going toward the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=303.24s)]
*  basket, not even look at the rim. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=308.12s)]
*  Just, I'm going to dish off to the corner. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=310.52s)]
*  I'm going to dish off to another guy. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=312.0s)]
*  He clearly has it in his head that he is playing a more facilitator role for this [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=313.2s)]
*  team and I can understand how they got to that point and why that would be a healthy [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=317.76s)]
*  thing for their offense. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=321.56s)]
*  But just seeing a player who's as explosive as him be so locked into what he thinks he [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=323.36s)]
*  can't or shouldn't be doing. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=329.0s)]
*  It's a failure on a lot of different fronts. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=331.48s)]
*  It's a failure of the management of his career to this point in the holistic sense. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=333.6s)]
*  And then he'll have this stretch. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=338.20000000000005s)]
*  Like, what was that play was when he all of a sudden exploded right to left across the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=339.36s)]
*  lane at warp speed and laid in traffic with the head did a layup. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=345.08000000000004s)]
*  We were all like, holy shit. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=350.08000000000004s)]
*  He has those bursts. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=351.48s)]
*  He has those bursts. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  He definitely does. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=354.28000000000003s)]
*  And even there was a play where he got fouled where that was like a quick twitch [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=355.44000000000005s)]
*  play where it's like, oh, look at Zion being explosive. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=359.20000000000005s)]
*  And I'm about to do the thing that I used to hate them when my mom did it to me. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=362.32000000000005s)]
*  She'd be like, look at such and such a son. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=365.72s)]
*  He's an engineer. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=367.8s)]
*  Look at such and such a son. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=369.24s)]
*  I heard he's in med school. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=370.48s)]
*  Blah, blah, blah, blah. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=371.84000000000003s)]
*  And again, look at Halliburton like that guy. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=373.24s)]
*  He is lighting a fire under his guys asses. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=376.20000000000005s)]
*  He gets those guys excited to play. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=380.96000000000004s)]
*  He's a leader. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=383.72s)]
*  To me, that's the biggest disappointment about Zion is that he doesn't carry himself [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=385.04s)]
*  like the franchise guy. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=389.76000000000005s)]
*  He doesn't carry himself like he did. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=391.32000000000005s)]
*  He didn't do carry himself. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=393.0s)]
*  He has him in him. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=394.28000000000003s)]
*  He did it at Duke for a couple weeks. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=395.44s)]
*  But he really gave a shit when he was at Duke. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=399.08s)]
*  And I thought we were saying, Rosilla was sitting with us and was saying like, you [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=401.0s)]
*  know, when, when Zion had that stretch, what, two years ago, when it was point [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=404.68s)]
*  forward Zion and he ripped off that two and a half, three month run. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=409.24s)]
*  And it was like, we're still, I was like favorite random league pass event. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=414.08s)]
*  It'd be, he just like lost his mind. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=418.32s)]
*  And I was saying like, we could almost do a narrative podcast about the one year [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=420.6s)]
*  Zion was in shape because it was fucking magical. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=423.92s)]
*  He was one of the best four offensive players in the league for three months [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=426.92s)]
*  of the season. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=431.84000000000003s)]
*  And I don't know to watch it like this. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=432.6s)]
*  I was really surprised and I don't know what they do because we got the trade [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=434.68s)]
*  deadline in two months, but they have a good team, you know, they have good young [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=439.32s)]
*  players and it feels like there's an identity in there, but then there's also [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=442.6s)]
*  this, this Zion piece and I don't know how they reconcile it, but, uh, it was, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=445.64s)]
*  that was, I think a big surprise to all of us. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=450.52s)]
*  Um, all right. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=453.6s)]
*  What do you got? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=454.52s)]
*  That's kind of the damning thing about this game though, is the Pelicans do have [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=455.28s)]
*  a good team. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=458.64s)]
*  They have a good supporting cast. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=459.52s)]
*  They have seemingly a lot of the things you should be, you should have to at [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=460.92s)]
*  least compete in a game like this. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=464.52s)]
*  And they couldn't even hang on the same floor with LeBron of these guys. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=466.56s)]
*  We were saying they might be better off telling Zion to go away for a couple [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=469.64s)]
*  of weeks and lose weight and get in shape. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=473.56s)]
*  Because, and then try to find an identity, you know, cause they have, they could be [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=476.8s)]
*  a really good defensive team if they wanted to be with the, especially when [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=480.88s)]
*  Nance comes back, it's not going to happen. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=483.88s)]
*  Uh, with Zion, I hope he figures it out, man, because, you know, we've seen with [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=486.0s)]
*  him and with Jah, these are two of the most talented dudes we've had in the last 15 [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=490.16s)]
*  years and both of them are just getting in their own way. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=494.36s)]
*  And it's like, just look around, get competitive with the other people that [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=496.56s)]
*  you're competing against in your age range. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=500.52000000000004s)]
*  You should watch that Tyrese Haliburton game and be like, fuck, that should be [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=502.36s)]
*  that should be me, but, uh, it was, so it was a little somber, but at the same time [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=506.04s)]
*  watching, I guess the, to put a bow on it, then there's LeBron who's maximized [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=511.28000000000003s)]
*  every drop from, from this already unbelievable body he had, right? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=517.52s)]
*  He's had the same blessings that Zion had in a lot of ways, physically and [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=521.24s)]
*  maximize all he does is put money and time and energy into his body so he [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=525.4s)]
*  can do what he did tonight. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=530.0s)]
*  And I don't know how Zion walks away from that and goes, am I doing something [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=531.9200000000001s)]
*  wrong? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=536.0s)]
*  Cause when you pay somebody 50 million a year, 40 million a year, whatever it is, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=536.52s)]
*  you reward him with the extension. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=541.28s)]
*  He thinks he's okay. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=543.6s)]
*  He's, he's fine. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=545.0s)]
*  He got paid. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=546.24s)]
*  He got the contract. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdFvCjPL5DQ&t=547.0s)]
