# Bill Simmonsâ€™s Worst NBA Contracts Draft | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [March 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndCTlsw7U7M)
*  All right. So where's contracts draft? Here's the deal. We're going to go in order.
*  We go in snake fashion. So if you get the first pick, you don't go again until six,
*  get the third pick, you get three and four and the middle pick just keeps sandwiching around.
*  We're going to try to each build the worst possible team of contracts. I have all the
*  numbers. I have everything written down. We're going to pour one out for the Westbrook wall
*  contracts. Those are really the standards. You had to take multiple first round picks just to get
*  rid of the contract. They couldn't trade them all summer. Houston had to buy out John Wall's
*  contract. They couldn't even like trade it. And then Westbrook, the Lakers finally unloaded,
*  got some players. They had to attach a pick to it. There's really no contract like that,
*  except for one that I think is going to be the first pick in this draft. So House,
*  how do we decide who drafts first? I can't remember how we did it last year,
*  but I don't want to go first because I feel like I know who's going to go first. And I've already
*  done my bit on this guy ad nauseam. Everybody knows how I feel about this particular player.
*  All right. So we'll give Waz first pick. House, you go second. I'll go third unless you want the
*  sandwich picks, House. No, no, we can keep it. You do like sandwiches. I do like sandwiches. If you
*  could give me a sandwich, I'll take it. But otherwise it's fine how we roll. All right,
*  Waz, you're on the clock. First pick in the 2023 worst contracts draft. Who is it?
*  Yeah, for me, this player deserves the worst contract because he has two years left on it
*  at around $80 million, which would mean that he's making $40 million annually after this year
*  and is not an NBA player. Like of all the people I have on my list, this guy's, and I'm just like,
*  you know what? Reasonably, I could say this guy deserves to be in an NBA rotation
*  and can play NBA basketball. They might be significantly overpaid, but they can all play
*  NBA basketball, except for this one guy. And that's Ben Simmons, who to me is the worst contract
*  in the NBA right now. Because one, he can't play when his back is bothering him or he's
*  suffering from some kind of mental health issue, or he's just straight up doesn't like the team
*  that he's on, whatever. And even when he does, he's still picking the splinters out of his ass
*  from the benching that Jacques Vaughn and Steve Nash, to be honest, have given them all season.
*  So to me, Ben Simmons is the worst deal in professional basketball, to the point where,
*  again, most of these guys, with some exceptions, I feel like if their deals were up in two years,
*  they would still get deals as Ben Simmons is even a minimum player in two years. He's the worst deal
*  in the NBA, in my opinion. He's my number one pick. My only quibble with that was, which is
*  a beautiful diatribe. The contract's actually worse than you gave it credit for. It's three years,
*  that too. Oh, excuse me, three years. Yeah, it's $35.448 million this year, $37.89 next year,
*  and then in 2024-25, guaranteed $40.338. The total package is over $113 million house
*  for three years. But this is a guy once upon a time we defended, we liked, we thought he was
*  a top 15 basketball player and the Nets bought a lemon. And I got to be honest, I don't understand
*  how the Nets front office survived this one. They rallied a little bit with the KD trade,
*  which I think they maximized what they could have gotten out of KD. And even the Kyrie trade looks
*  pretty good. The Dows might not even make the playoffs. So it's not like they lost any skin
*  on that one. But panic trading hardened and just basically getting Seth Curry, who they're not
*  really playing. And then these two firsts that don't really matter. And then Simmons as the
*  linchpin without doing any real research into what was going on with him. And they trade him. He's
*  hurt right away. I thought it was indefensible. Where do you stand, House? So you just said two
*  things that I'm not sure are a matter of public record and, you know, widely held views. In the
*  first place, I don't feel like the James Harden trade was a panic trade. I feel like Kyrie Irving
*  drove James Harden away from a team that James Harden was willing to make a commitment to,
*  did make a commitment to and enjoyed playing for and with. But he was still on the team.
*  They were still paying him. He was an employee of the Brooklyn Nets. Exactly. Kyrie took a knife and
*  knifed him in the back. He tried. James Harden, you know, at least showed up in the playoffs and
*  tried to drag that team when Kyrie, you know, had had his, you know, whatever big toe injury and then,
*  you know, whatever provocative stance he had to take on public health and other kinds of
*  shenanigans and distractions. I didn't feel like it was a panic trade from, from Brooklyn's
*  perspective. And I also thought that it was a reasonable gamble. I'm not so sure that they
*  didn't do their diligence. I think that they did do some, some diligence. It's just, you don't know
*  until you know. And I think, I think he got hurt worse after the trade. And that's what set us on
*  this trajectory to where we are right here at this moment. And part of the thing, the reason why I
*  didn't anticipate Simmons being the number one pick in this draft is because at the time that
*  contract was given him, he had earned it. I mean, he, the, the, the forecast for him, well,
*  we can quibble, but he had accomplished some stuff. He had accomplished some stuff.
*  The Bradley Beal thing is entirely different. And I'm not going into there. I'm not going into there.
*  I can't lay you off the hook. Go ahead. Didn't have to trade James Harden. Oh, cause Kyrie didn't
*  want to play home games cause of the vaccine. So now James Harden's like, well, I don't want to play
*  basketball either. Yeah. I know it was a dysfunctional situation, but he was still an asset. You know,
*  when you look at, at the prices of some of these stars that are being thrown around now, like,
*  I don't know if you're Philly, you're doing that trade pretty much every time they're holding out
*  with Simmons for something. You agree with that was I, I just don't know why they had to do it.
*  If they didn't know that Simmons was healthy. I agree with you. In the sense that I felt coming
*  into the season that the Sixers had no leverage in the sense that one, the guy couldn't come back
*  and play for the Sixers. There's just, there was just no, it became so toxic with Doc, with Joel,
*  with all, with the fans. He can't play for your team again. That's a one. And then the two,
*  the last time we watched him play was against the Hawks in the playoffs in which he was a pumpkin.
*  So he's a bad player who can't come back to your team, which is why I kind of agree with Bill.
*  And at the time of the trade, I was like, yo, everybody's hubris has kind of been rewarded
*  here. Ben Simmons is nonsense. He gets to go to the team that he wanted to go to. The stubbornness
*  that Darrell Morey showed in just holding the guy and being like, somebody's going to bite.
*  And then James Harden, throwing another temper tantrum and getting his way. Ultimately, everybody's
*  ridiculousness got rewarded in that trade. But again, I thought Ben Simmons was a toxic asset
*  immediately after that Hawks series. They somehow got a freaking all star for him. And now like,
*  look at this. He can't play. He doesn't play. He's like the 13th man. Well, I mean, there were some
*  red flags with the fact that he seemed very comfortable just not playing for reasons that
*  seemed pretty unclear to everybody. Like his feelings were hurt. It just felt like it had
*  run its course. By the way, and this is not talking out of school, Bill. Like we know what
*  he was doing. I have this on good authority. He's in the Hollywood Hills throwing parties
*  and hanging out. That's what he was doing when he wasn't playing. He wasn't hard at work at his game.
*  That's the thing. And we know that from a basketball work ethic standpoint, there were things that
*  just didn't seem to be getting better in any way, shape or form.
*  When the trade happened, Harden just seemed like a damaged asset because he had quit on two teams
*  in 10 months. And Simmons seems like a damaged asset to me. And I didn't know who was going to
*  win the trade. And there was a real possibility both teams were going to lose the trade.
*  You look at how Harden's playing this year. I have Harden, like he's definitely going to be on one of
*  my three all NBA teams. I'm just telling you, he'll either be second team or third team,
*  but he's going to be all NBA for me. Unless he just tails off the last 10 games. It's turned out
*  way better for Philly than I ever imagined. And honestly, way worse for the Nets than I ever
*  imagined. The fact that he's unplayable seemed inconceivable to me. You could have told me he
*  at least could have been like rebounds and defense and just refused to shoot the ball anymore. Seemed
*  like a worst case scenario. This is a way worst case scenario. This is a guy who might be out of
*  the league or getting bought out. Anyway, all right. Enough on Ben Simmons. Who do you have for
*  number two pick house? Well, before we move on, I have a question for you. So you sent me a was a
*  list. Was it your goal and intention that we use this list exclusively or we allow to bring some?
*  No. Okay. All right. He basically leaked his big board. Yeah. I just, I gave you a little, I sent you
*  maybe, I don't know, 50 contracts. But last year, if you remember famously, was went off the board
*  with a Klay Thompson pick that singed my eyebrows off. It took me six months to regrow my eyebrows
*  after that. Well, lo and behold, the list you sent us has Klay Thompson on it. The reason I asked that
*  question, Bill Simmons from Boston, is because I didn't see one single Charmin Celtic on this list.
*  Well, I sent it a month ago. I sent it to you guys literally five weeks ago. It wasn't that long ago.
*  In any event, I'm not going to select any of the Charmin Celtics with the second overall pick
*  because it's not time yet, but there's going to be some Charmin Celtics that catch some fire.
*  I'll tell you this. On this podcast today. I was updating the final list of that page that I sent you.
*  Yes. I did add a Celtic. I mean, I come up with two. Don't spoil it. No spoiler alerts. I've got two
*  potential ones, but I am now in this position where I must do the thing that I said I wasn't
*  going to do, which is take Bradley Beal. I'll keep it short and sweet. And then you guys,
*  you know, it'll be easy. The one thing you cannot do in professional sports is pay a non-superstar
*  like a goddamn superstar. And it is something that you cannot recover from. It will take the
*  entirety of this contract, the full duration of the five years that he got to make one step forward
*  in terms of a recovery. The team has locked in a 36 to 40 win ceiling. And that's assuming that
*  they keep poor Zingus and Kuzma. I have serious doubts about Kuz sticking around. For what purpose?
*  Now I will say this. I like going to the games. It's fun to go down there,
*  check them out. I'm getting some really good seats and see the other teams come through.
*  It's a very relaxed environment, but there isn't any serious basketball being played.
*  And this is what they chose. And I'm not even talking about all the bells and whistles,
*  the no trade clause and all the other nonsense. Kicker. Right. Exactly. Well, why don't you tell
*  the audience how much the contract is for? Or do you want me to? Are you unable to speak the words?
*  The Podfather, the Podfather. You run the numbers, brother.
*  Well, it's year one of a five year deal, Woz, for a cool and crisp 251 million.
*  Jesus Christ. That's the contract. I watched a game last week where
*  it was a totally winnable game and he did a couple Bradley Beal things and they lost.
*  It was against the Hawks. I know. Yeah. As a last minute guy, he is not in my top half of guys I
*  want with the ball doing stuff in the last minute. But that's the thing about this wizard season.
*  It's been a fun season. They're always in these close games and more often than not, they blow
*  them. I agree with house. The contract is crazy. I would be really curious to see if they try to
*  trade it this summer, what kind of offers they'd be getting back because you'd have to have the
*  money that matched it combined with picks and stuff like that. Woz is just making kind of a sad,
*  grim face right now. What do you think, Woz? Yeah, it's tough. He's clearly not worth the deal in the
*  sense that he's just not a superstar. He doesn't by himself elevate an offense to competence in and
*  of himself. Bradley Beal is not an offense unto himself. He's a good offensive player,
*  high volume. The shooting has gotten better. He's always had this reputation as a shooter,
*  but has never had the shooting to match it up. He's never been anybody's idea of a playmaker.
*  He's kind of just been like, look, he can do a reasonable job at elevated volumes and usage
*  percentage, but his defense has always been a little bit overrated. And yeah, the idea that
*  you would pay this guy, he is the leader of a franchise sort of North Star of competence
*  is just not the case. And there's been times with Kyle Kuzma who gets paid about a fourth
*  of his salary has just been better than the guy, which is just insane to consider.
*  And so the people listening, we're just talking about everybody that we're about to draft just
*  as the asset, production, quality versus the money figure. And in this case, Beal's having
*  a solid year statistically, right? It's 23.4 points a game, four assists, five and a half assists,
*  four rebounds, 51, 37, 85 percentage splits. It's solid. If he was your third guy, you'd be
*  pumped. If he was your second guy, you could talk yourself into it as long as you had an awesome
*  first guy. It's what house laid out when this is your signature guy, your number one dude,
*  where are you going? And the answer is what we watch with the Wizards. You're
*  39 and 43, 40 and 42, 42 and 40. You're going to be in that range. Porzingis is 22 and nine this year.
*  I mean, he's been a really high level, above average offensive center. And Kuzma is a good
*  player. That's not ever going to be enough. And then you have the other thing is you have no chance
*  to improve from this basis point. What do you do? How do you add people? You really can't.
*  So to me, the problem with Bradley Bale is he's getting paid as if the difference between him
*  and Jordan Poole, say, is the difference between Jordan Poole and Devin Booker or even Donovan
*  Mitchell. And that's just not the case. He's not as good as those two people who play his position.
*  And he's paid like he is. And that's just not true. He's more in line with a Jordan Poole,
*  in my opinion, than he is. Like a more efficient Jordan Poole. Yeah, those top level NBA all star
*  type of guys, all NBA kind of guys. All right. I'm on the clock with the third pick.
*  Can't believe this guy's still on the board. Seems like a nice guy by all accounts.
*  Duncan Robinson, who signed a five for 90 last year, still has the four for 74.3 left.
*  It's like a like a Bertowns 2.0 kind of contract. It's kind of staggering.
*  There's always different reasons why he's not playing or why he hasn't been successful,
*  but he has not been successful really since he signed the contract. Again, seems like a cool guy.
*  I root for him. Self-made man worked his way up, turned himself into a really cool story,
*  got the bag and has not been really heard from since. And, you know, it speaks to a bigger issue
*  of these Miami moves the last couple of years where after the really smart Jimmy Butler move
*  and the hero draft pick the last couple of years, like every swing, he culture, Pat Riley,
*  every swing they've taken has either not worked or really failed. And yet I'm still terrified in
*  the playoffs that they're probably going to beat the Celtics in the 2-7 or 3-6. I'm just already
*  resigned to it. But anyway, I have him as the third pick. Yeah, I like the pick. Especially,
*  I believe the last year of his deal was a player option. Spoiler alert, he will be picking up that
*  player option. Well, that's the thing. I just factored that in. It's 17 million a year.
*  And again, similar to Ben Simmons, but I think the difference between Duncan Robinson and Ben
*  Simmons is like he has an identifiable NBA talent, which is his shooting, even if for whatever reason
*  it sort of can't shoot anymore. I don't know. Is it still a talent? I have to believe that. He was
*  so incredible at it when he sort of burst onto the scene three years ago. And I have to believe
*  that he could find minutes on another team that was in Miami. But yeah, I like this deal. It was
*  very, very high up on my board. So salute to you. You like this deal. I like how bad this deal is.
*  It is funny. It's a throwback deal. It reminds me of the era when guys like Isaiah Thomas was a GM
*  and or a coach. And Doc is also guilty of this. They go up against somebody that is hot, that
*  tortures their team. And then they hand out a giant contract. I mean, you can do your Jerome James. You
*  can do way back when Seattle overpaying for Jim McElveen because he had a decent year for the
*  Bullets and didn't pay Sean Kemp. But teams see something, jump in, gross overpay, and you're
*  stuck with it. Shout out. I mean, I guess in a way it shouldn't surprise me that it was Riles
*  because it's an old school kind of contract. Well, I'll say this about what he did too is that Miami's
*  offense became so hard to guard around people being completely terrified of what he was doing
*  off the ball, right? Like his movement and how he was catching and shooting on the run, like that
*  completely opened up their offense and they went to the finals behind that. Right. Well, listen,
*  I understand wanting to reward it, something that was central to your finals run. Well, 2020,
*  he was 45% from three, 8.3 is a game in the regular season in the playoffs. He played 21
*  games for them. He was 28.6 minutes a game. They made the finals. He's 40% from three that year.
*  So last year, last year or the 2021 year, he was a little banged up, wasn't the same.
*  And then they said, well, screw it. Let's pay him off the 2020 year. And it didn't work.
*  There was a baseball player, the Red Sox had named Dave Stapleton.
*  Every year for the first eight years of his career, his batting average went down.
*  And it was, it's like the most fascinating baseball reference page to look at. He starts out at like
*  321 and each year it goes down. Robinson's kind of working on that in basketball reference. 20 is
*  13.5, 13.1 a year after 10.9 last year, 6.7 this year, playing 17 minutes a game.
*  And the funny or not so funny thing is they kind of need them. Like they need one more shooter.
*  Struce has been playing more for them, but- But he can't stop a nosebleed bill.
*  And that's just not going to cut it in Miami. And he just shooting. It's funny. It's
*  almost like when you have that reliever in baseball who's lights out for a year and then
*  the next year they can't find the strike zone. You're thinking, what happened? You were throwing
*  99 over the middle last year. Now you can't, you're hitting guys. All right. So the draft
*  board has dropped a little bit. That was really the big three. There's multiple guys here who
*  could go with the number four pick. I'm going to go with an old standby. Just, just tease an OG.
*  Maybe it's a little high. It's like when you're in a fantasy draft and you, those years where
*  you'd see Tom Brady and you'd be like, wow, Tom Brady's going for eight bucks. I gotta get him.
*  I just feel like getting this guy with the fourth pick is such great value. Davos Bertons again,
*  three, three for 49. He's got two years left after this one. He's almost,
*  almost at 50 million bucks left on his deal. And, and it just delights me to know. And it's,
*  how's his team was responsible for the contract house defended it at the time. No, no, he's been
*  great. I like it. It's just like the wizard's DNA just infected your body. Anyway, Davos,
*  you're the fourth pick. What do you got? I have no argument with it. I mean, you know,
*  he belongs in China and, you know, I wouldn't be surprised if there's some, some buyout activity
*  as we come up to the next season, because Dallas has to go through some wholesale
*  looking in the mirror here. Come on now. We're not going to send them to China. We're going to
*  send him back to Europe. Eurobasket. I'm sure he could find a team in Italy or, or, uh, Israel,
*  somebody picked that guy up. But yeah, I had, I laughed by the time I got to his deal. I was
*  like, wow, this is still a horrible deal. He's going forever. He's gotten some tick in Dallas
*  and you know, he's been useful at, at moments for them this year. But if you watch Dallas at all,
*  you realize that they are one of the worst defenses in the league this year easily. And, um,
*  Davies, Bertons does not aid in that mission. So, um, yeah, that's a great,
*  you know, what's funny that I've changed my mind on that poor Zinke's trade a hundred times,
*  right? Cause Dallas did make the Western finals last year. Didn't really was a piece of it,
*  but now you look at it, Dallas doesn't, they can't find a center.
*  They had to roll the dice with Christian Wood who's that's been super unhappy. Oh, who could
*  have figured. Um, and poor Zinkas is playing really well for the wizards and didn't wait.
*  He just gets kind of passed around the league, but, uh, that's actually a pretty good relationship
*  had kind of broken down, right? Like they, they, they kind of just didn't like each other or didn't
*  like playing with each other at least. I don't know if it was personal, but like it became toxic
*  between those two and these teams, Bill, like, you know what, how they are there. They're so desperate
*  to keep the young superstar happy that they'll do damn near anything. And you know,
*  the poor Zingas deal seemed like a no brainer for them where they just dumped the guy's deal.
*  Um, and it was like, look, he's not getting along with Luca. We gotta get them out of here.
*  I think they might've won the trade.
*  The one that Tommy Shepard's only good moves we could really point to. All right,
*  House here in the clock fifth pick.
*  This to me was not very challenging and I want to give kudos. I want everybody to make sure you
*  listen to this week's podcast with Bill Simmons featuring Kevin O'Connor, cause there is a very
*  interesting conversation about the return and resurgence of the big man, the NBA basketball.
*  And it's a curious moment and it's a very thoughtful conversation. I enjoyed it very much.
*  It made me feel very, very confident with this next next pick. And that is Rudy Gobert
*  of the Minnesota Timberwolves now, a contract with four years and $170 million left on it.
*  And I will tell you this, Bill Simmons, while I listen to you and KOC run through 10 or 12 or 15
*  different centers and the attributes that the modern center offers and the most successful
*  modern centers, Rudy Gobert is a specialist and not a very good one. It is as though in the NFL
*  using a first round pick or a second round pick or a third round pick on a punter or a kicker,
*  he has one specific skill that that's only translatable and worthwhile from a competitive
*  standpoint in a single context, which is regular season around the hoop defense.
*  And we have seen from the early indications of the relationship between he and Carl Anthony
*  Towns in Minnesota, an inability from this guy to get along from a playing standpoint. Now I
*  don't know whether or not, you know, personally what, what, what the story is. Cause he's a,
*  he was just, he arrived and then KAT got hurt in fairly short order. But Minnesota is right on
*  the cut line here of missing out on the playoffs. It's in the best they can hope for is making the
*  play in and I don't have them making the playoffs. And they're even in the, in the play in a situation.
*  You know what's crazy about go bear that the advanced metrics still don't mind them.
*  Yeah. Like there's the offense defense ratings, all that stuff. Like they're,
*  they basically like him more than the eye test does. I agree with house. I had go bear in the
*  top five or six was because not only is it a bad contract, not only is it a constant reminder that
*  you gave up all this stuff for this guy who might not even make you a first round playoff team,
*  but he's 30 and I don't see his game aging well, which was the other issue with the trade. What's
*  he going to look like when he's 33? So he's going to be like, if he gets a tad slower and a,
*  a tad more mummy-ish every year, which is what we've seen over and over again with bigger centers,
*  what is that going to look like in two years? Then they'll have two years left on the deal.
*  So a couple of things on Rudy. I think he's being paid as if, you know, the thing that he was very
*  special at, he's still special at, right? Which is defense, defensive player of the year
*  level production. I don't think he's no longer, he's no longer special. He's still very good
*  defensive player, defensive big, but he's no longer special. And so to be paid the way that he is to
*  be a one dimensional guy and not be outstanding at that dimension is tough. And two, and you know,
*  he makes me think of another play. He makes me think of Brook Lopez because Brook Lopez,
*  I don't think has any better foot speed or even defensive instincts as Rudy. And he's been that
*  plotting drop defender sort of big man, but he's changed over the past couple of years.
*  He's been willing to come up to the level more, even do a little bit of switching out more.
*  He's just gotten better at what the modern demands are. I don't see why Rudy couldn't do that,
*  but Brook on the other end is providing you with all this spacing while punishing switches.
*  It's just, it's just tough. I don't know how Rudy sort of regains his value, even if he starts to
*  adjust, you know, his game going forward. Yeah, I think we would all like his contract if it was
*  four for 60. But when you throw in the extra 110 million, that's when I take pause.
*  Yes. I like that pick house. All right, was last pick of the second round. Who do you got?
*  See, this is, this is easy for me. And it's related to Rudy go bear. It's the guy who they
*  traded for Rudy go bear to play his position, who has five years after this year at $260 million.
*  They traded for first round pigs, the rights to their damn draft, all of this stuff for a dude
*  that's already making $45 million to play your spot. And you still get paid a max contract.
*  Carl Anthony Towns, it's just a horrible deal. And the reason why I know it's a horrible deal,
*  Bill, this guy is their max contract player. He hasn't played since essentially December.
*  We don't know what his timeline to return is. Nobody's talked. Nobody even talks about it.
*  It's not even spoken of. People have just moved on. Carl Towns is going,
*  who cares? This dude has $260 million left on his deal. Right. And I, and again, I think,
*  you know, some people would say his contract isn't all that unvaluable because there might
*  be somebody dumb enough, willing to actually give Minnesota stuff for him in a potential trade.
*  Because I think obviously he's the next domino to move. They have no other choices, but I doubt
*  that. I have a Towns update, Was. It's 3 34 Pacific time on a Wednesday. He's expected to return in
*  the coming weeks, quote, according to the Timberwolves. Wow. He's continuing to progress
*  in his rehabilitation program. He's screaming with the reserve players and coaches this week.
*  Like, what the, what did he get? Like his calf cut off his body. How is this calf injury this
*  long? I'm with you, Was. That is a really, really, really, really tough contract to digest next to
*  the Go Bear contract because I think they can trade Towns. And I actually think there will be
*  a market for him because if you look at, you know, his offensive production, oh, the house
*  is raised his head and the hoops IQ stuff that we saw from him in the playoffs last year,
*  which was appalling and reprehensible as the months pass, people forget like with anything else.
*  It's like, oh yeah, they lost in the playoffs. They don't remember some of the shit that actually
*  happened in that series. I think he's, I think he's the number one draft pick to get traded
*  this summer of all the stars. How's you want him? I would trade Bradley Beal for Carl Anthony Towns
*  as fast as you put a giant plate of fried chicken from Popeyes in front of me. And I take that
*  sucker down. Like I can't tell you how fast I would make that trade. The money is nearly equivalent.
*  The one aspect of the Bradley Beal thing that I forgot to mention, he's 29 years old, turning 30
*  this year in the first year. We're going to have the first year of this contract done. Another four
*  years. Great track record for actually, I don't want, I shouldn't say it, share any of this because
*  I want him traded. He's great. He's a great team player, second banana, third banana. Minnesota,
*  you can work Beal in, let him be a catch and shoot out on the perimeter. Let Anthony Edwards,
*  you know, drive and kick and go back and stand in the middle and mobile. That's a perfect compliment.
*  So let him be a shorter Carl Towns. I don't understand that.
*  I wonder, you know, he's a Kentucky guide. I wonder if the Knicks have him on their radar.
*  There's always the Phoenix, could you put him with Durant,
*  Deandre and that kind of thing. I think there's, I think could see the Warriors talking themselves
*  into him. I think there's a lot of teams that would kick the tires on that because his production,
*  he was putting up 25 and 10 or 25 and 11, whatever, 40% three point shooting. Like you just,
*  you look at the basketball reference page for two minutes and you forget all the other stuff. You're
*  like, Whoa, look at those stats. Wow. And that's it. That's where house is. Is he twice the salary
*  worth of Julius Randall? I just, I find that hard to believe because he's going to have to play
*  power forward, right? He'll play Julius Randall's position. And obviously he is on another
*  stratosphere of offensive player, but he's way worse at defense. That's crazy. Is that is to say
*  about Julius Randall used to suck. He's just way worse at like the few minutes that he did play
*  with go bear. It was, it was a joke that anybody could think this guy could play defensive minutes
*  at power forward. It's, I don't know. I think Carl Towns, man, I just think he's a losing player.
*  I really do. I don't know how, if he is the focal point of what you do and you commit all of those
*  resources to him, how your team can be very good. Minnesota, they had it ideal for him last year
*  with all of these really wiry long athletic guys. They played this hyper aggressive defense that
*  allowed town to just be like, you know what, just be aggressive at the top. Everybody else is going
*  to handle your business behind the play and close to the rim because we're so rangey and athletic
*  and strong and all of that. And in this year, trying to get him to just be a traditional big.
*  It's tough. I'm reasonably sure his extension has not kicked in yet. No, it hasn't. It starts
*  next year, which hearkens back to one of my favorite NBA moments of all time. When Washington
*  gave Andre Blatch an extension and it hadn't kicked in yet. And then it kicked in and they
*  amnestied it. They amnestied it right after it kicked in. Cause one of the best in the Anos house.
*  We have to do a top 75 worst wizards bullets moves podcast. That's gotta be top 12, the Andre Blatch
*  extension. You'll get at least 10 listeners for that. I'm sure. Oh, wow. You get one more pick top
*  of the third round. Okay. Oh yeah. This, this one hurts me because I really like this player,
*  but it's become plainly obvious that he's overpaid and it feels like he's unmovable.
*  And that's John Collins. He's got three years, almost 80 million left after this year. And ever
*  since he's ruined his, the finger on his shooting hand, he can't shoot anymore. And if John Collins
*  isn't sort of respectable from three, if you look at his three point percent,
*  it's just completely plummeted since that injury. He's shooting in the twenties now.
*  He's just not as effective of a player. And he's been on the traded block for two solid years and
*  nobody's bitten. And I like him. I think he's a tough player. He plays with an incredible motor.
*  I believe he can give you minutes at the five defensively. He's switchable vertical spacing
*  with the hops on lobs and all of that. But man, he can't shoot worth a damn. And he doesn't do
*  anything else offensively. And so yeah, the contract is tough right now. And it hurts me Bill.
*  And I know you like the Hawks. I love John Collins. I know you, I know you watched a lot of Hawks
*  in general. The three point shooting went off a quip this year, 25%. House, I like the, the concept
*  of somebody being on the trade block for like more than a year. And it's been a year and a half for
*  him. It's just an incredibly long amount of time for somebody to work for an employer where it's
*  been patently clear. They're not totally satisfied with the working relationship and maybe want to
*  send you to greener pastures and just can't find the right thing out. The interesting thing with
*  Collins, so Phoenix is going to trade for him, right? It's going to happen. And the day before
*  the trade deadline, that new owner they have, Matt Ishbia, he's like, wait a second,
*  we can't get the ramp because you don't want to give up Mikhail Bridges. And they're like, yeah,
*  yeah, Mikhail's off limits. He's like, what the fuck are you guys doing? Put Bridges in the trade.
*  And they throw him in the trade and so long John Collins. But I'm with Wise House. I'm not sure
*  if you're like the 6'10 forward, you're an okay rebounder, not incredible, but you also can't
*  shoot threes. I don't know how you play in 2023 on a really good team. I mean, you have to be a
*  fourth option and they're paying him like he's in between a second and third option. That's the
*  problem with the dollars that he's getting. Yeah, he's like discount Tobias Harris. But Tobias
*  Harris at least makes open threes. Tobias Harris, interesting name. Yeah, that's a good name.
*  Oh, a house here on the clock.
*  Tobias Harris. Wait, no, I'm not going to do it even though he's grossly overpaid and I fully
*  expect him off the board within the next two rounds. I hope Wise forgives me. I'm going back to
*  Atlanta. See, it's a damned if you do, damned if you don't for the Hawks because you have a player
*  that is the face of the franchise that gives you that moment. Oh my God. Who else is it?
*  I need like a safety harness. Where are we going? Who else is the face of the Atlanta Hawks franchise?
*  And the dude is a coach killer. Only two, to be fair, only two coaches.
*  His career was resuscitated and saved by Nate Robinson. And he said, thank you so much, Nate.
*  And he took a giant knife out this year and stabbed it right in McMillan's back. And what is your
*  best case scenario with Trey Young? Can I redo the contract? You keep leaving. You never,
*  you keep forgetting to say the contract. Well, here's the contract. Five years, $215 million.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Wise is just nodding sadly. Look, I'm going to start calling him Young Beal.
*  Here's what I'll say about Trey Young. In his career, he's proven that he can be an elite
*  offensive player, right? Like just having him on the floor around base level competence,
*  you will have really good offense. Like he's proven to be that kind of guy in his career.
*  However, the stuff where it seems like he's impossible to work with and deal with on a
*  professional and human level, that's a problem. To me, that's bigger than, you know, can't guard
*  anybody and all of this kind of stuff. It's like the attitude around the team, the way these guys
*  play is just so lifeless and not very, they don't play for each other. This doesn't seem to be a
*  connected group. He's gotten two coaches fired, Nate McMillan to the point where he's like defying
*  people in the press where he's just like, yo, fam, I know I'm going to get fired. I don't care. I'm
*  not taking shit from this kid anymore. Like that, to me, that's bad. And that's why I'll lend this
*  some credence because of the stuff off the court. I think on the court, he's worth his deal,
*  but off the court stuff, it has to come into consideration when you consider somebody a
*  quote unquote franchise guy where he's pissing everybody off from John Collins to Nate McMillan
*  to you name it. Well, Murray will be the litmus test for this, right? If Murray doesn't want to stay,
*  then I think that's another chip in the, uh-oh, what's going on here with Trey O'Narcel?
*  Yeah. All right. I'm on the clock.
*  I need a ruling on Lonzo ball. Oh, man. I'm glad you can have the conversation. So Lonzo has three
*  for 61.5 yet, but it might be just an injury. You just get to write it off. It might not count
*  against the cap. You might get to replace it. So I don't know. Is it a bad contract or is it just
*  a sad contract? I think it's a sad contract. Those first few months with him and Caruso on the bulls
*  was must see TV with these guys were doing the back courts in the NBA. Just I'm such a fan of
*  Lonzo's game and Biola County is a great guy for his need to be so cooked. This stuff that hurt
*  me, Bill, that hurt. Oh, your guy, David Griffin's like, yeah, Chicago, you should take them.
*  It'd be great. We're gonna let them go. All right. So Lonzo,
*  hold on, Bill speak like grips reputation. I've never seen a roller coaster reputation. I know
*  like grips before in my life where it's like, he's a genius for the ad deal. Then it's like,
*  he's an idiot for what he's doing with Lonzo. Then it's like, Oh my God, look at all this stuff.
*  New Orleans has they bought the beat. They might go to the Western Conference finals this year.
*  They got all the wizard. The Lakers are going to get them women. Yeah, I'm up. Blah, blah, blah.
*  And then now it's back to what the fuck is grip. It's crazy. He needs like his own crisis from
*  I am. I'm going to audible. I'm going to audible in a way that's going to please both of you.
*  This is the second biggest punch that he's taken this season. The first one came courtesy of
*  Draymond Green. The second one is right now because Jordan Peele, you are the ninth pick of
*  this year. It's five for 132, but this year is the cheap deal. Next year it kicks in and he's like a
*  30 plus million dollar player. I've watched, I don't watch every Warriors game. I watch a lot of
*  basketball. I don't watch every Warriors game. I watch a few of them though. I've personally
*  witnessed four different times when his teammates have become completely disgusted with him during
*  a game on the court. That's a way down. I don't, to me it's just like if you're going to have your
*  heat check or rational confidence guy, the market for that is 12 to 13 million and it's not 30. And
*  I think they overreacted to last year and his ability to play on big stages. I just, I really
*  worry about this contract if I'm then this is too much money for somebody who's a defensive liability
*  who just seems really heat checking and I don't know if there's a next gear and I like him. I've
*  been a huge defender of him the last couple years, but I have not liked what I've seen this year,
*  House. You're not exactly. Well, he's 23 years old. So if you want to try and come up with
*  a justification, a rationale for why there's yet time and, and you know, I really think we're going
*  to look back at that punch as a sliding doors moment for the Warriors franchise. I mean,
*  uh, uh, I, I, I feel like the part of the reason why the Warriors don't win games on the road
*  has to do with an overall cohesion because it's deep lack of cohesion. Yeah. That's precisely
*  that's right. They're missing it. And I, you know, I've heard, Hey, Mike, our guy, Eddie Johnson
*  talked about this on, uh, on his show with term, knee that I like, but just about
*  something like that at the healing of an incident like that is just way longer than I think the
*  dumb asses like us would think. And, you know, especially when it's, it's, uh, Draymond's the
*  leader of the team and it's just, Hey, can you lead the same way after that? And look, it's
*  anecdotal, but the seven for 26 is not anecdotal. That's a real number on the road that, you know,
*  they're playing the Clippers tonight before we take this, but that's a crazy number. That's like
*  fucking Houston Rockets should be seven 26 on the road, not the Warriors. So, um, anyway, I just,
*  the pool contract makes me nervous and we're at the point in the draft where it's like, I'm just
*  looking at that kind of money. It hasn't even kicked in yet and I'm not sure. I just feel like
*  I can get better options for that, for that spot. So why does you seem like you want to defend it?
*  The reason why I defend it is cause I think this is kind of just the going rate for these dudes.
*  And by these dudes, I mean, these shooting guards who score and do absolutely nothing else. Right.
*  And it's not as Jordan pool is Anthony Simon's is CJ McCollum. Uh, these guys who would just,
*  they're just one dimensional players. Uh, but they seem to all get paid, right? Here's another one.
*  Tyler hero. Exactly. Um, who, you know, by the way, I think he's a little better than pool.
*  Yeah. I think, but that's the thing here on pool. We're side by side heading into the season
*  hero ascended. I think pool went backwards a little bit. Yeah. And, but I felt like it just
*  felt backwards cause the stakes seem so high in golden state. Right. And so when pool's not
*  delivering, it's like, Whoa, this is supposed to be the championship favorite. And this guy's
*  supposed to be a huge part of what they're doing. And he's not delivering on that. And so part of
*  me, I'm like, yeah, he's probably overpaid, but also I think this is just how these guys get
*  valued. Once you have, once it's identifiable where it's like, you can shoot and you can create your
*  own shot pretty consistently and efficiently, their teams are going to pay you for that.
*  And so, you know, he's in line with his peers, but damn, it's a lot of bread and, and, and, and,
*  and the side costs of it was sort of disrupting the tranquility with Draymond green, who's just
*  in a vacuum is a better player than Jordan pool is. And then when you consider what he means to
*  this team specifically, like he's just better. And then he has to watch Jordan pool get paid. So
*  it has like these compounding factors. It's like, damn. How's you want to guess his three point
*  percentage this year heading into tonight's Clippers game? I know it's among the worst
*  in the, in the NBA. It's a little bit 32.9. Oh, okay. But he takes eight a game. I'm just
*  going to go chalk on this one. Just need an easy one. You know, it was a Jordan pool conversation.
*  I think it took a lot out of us. We disagreed on some stuff. This one, there's no disagreement
*  whatsoever. He's French. He plays for the Knicks. He's, it's, it's a mere pittance. It's two for
*  36.9. And then he has a player option or the team option team. So it's really only this year, next
*  year. The contract is so bad and it's so weird that he's just not even a rotation guy anymore.
*  And then you see him on the bench and he's always kind of standing there and it's not really
*  applauding. He's just kind of watching the game like the rest of us and his name is Evan Fournier
*  and I'm making him my pick. Uh, why has any thoughts? Yeah, 100%. Uh, this is, this was on my
*  board. I had this sort of highlighted cause it's like one, he's going to make 20 million next year
*  and this is a guy who would struggle to earn a contract of four or 5 million in Europe.
*  Right. And you're paying him to do nothing on the Knicks and it's, but it's with good reason. He's
*  just, he's just not an effective offensive player. He's never been anybody's idea of a defender,
*  at a position where you need people who can hold up to the most skilled guys in the league. And so
*  yeah, this is a terrible deal. And Tim's was really stubborn about playing. I'm playing
*  veterans last year. He was so damn stubborn about this shit. Um, where this year he's
*  finally found religion and it's just quickly and grinds and you know, all of the young guys now
*  and, and Fournier is, yeah, he's master Splinter now. Well, we always talk about the 50, 40, 90
*  guys house. Fournier is working on a 35, 32, 86. It's unconventional. True shooting is 490 this year.
*  He played 44 minutes in February. He's played zero this month. It just sucks to have the bad
*  contract words like Duncan Robinson. There might be one more run with him. You never know. It's
*  like, Oh man, Oh, he had some threes. The Fournier thing is like sunk cost. He doesn't want to be
*  there. They wish he wasn't there clearly this summer heading into the last year of his contract.
*  He'll be a trade piece. And did I leave anything else house house? No, I mean, I'm looking, uh,
*  first of all, Fournier and Bertons that both those guys could go to Europe. That would make,
*  I want to make an all Europe team. That makes sense to me. But look, you mentioned Duncan Robinson,
*  the contracts kind of line up Fournier Robinson. Does that do anything for you?
*  Well, yeah, they line up from a year by year standpoint, but the Robinson goes way longer
*  is the issue. All right, house here in the class. Yes. Um, we, we mentioned this guy's name and this
*  is purely a function of the amount of money that he makes relative to how important he is
*  to this team's success. And it is Tobias Harris. Uh, I think it's time, time to go ahead and call
*  it out. He's got two years at $77 million. That is the, you know, he's perfectly fine, right? He's
*  shooting around 50%. He's averaging. I have the, you know, the numbers up here. He's a mid level
*  exception level player. Like a, like a, like slightly better than like that Jay Crowder level
*  of the 10 million a year. Maybe he's like a 14 million a year guy. And, and, and he is, you know,
*  inconsistent in a way that would be fine if you were paying him at that kind of level, but his
*  inconsistency, you just like, look at his last five games, he plays 25 minutes on Sunday against
*  the wizard shoots 36%. Uh, oh wow. He's, he's, his shooting percentage has been bad lately, but
*  you know, four games ago, a 50% game and then five games ago, a 66% game, you know, 14 rebounds,
*  three nights ago, uh, you know, three rebounds, uh, uh, you know, against the wizard. So it's,
*  it's that inconsistency. It's that up and down where Philly is legit. That's a serious team.
*  They are formidable. I am excited to see them where they land playoff wise. I think they're
*  going to get the two seed and, and, and, and, uh, beat out the Charmin Celtics. I'm sorry, Podfather.
*  Um, it would be great if they could get some consistent play out of Tobias. That's all.
*  Yeah. 15 and six this year was. Yeah, that's yeah. When they, the, my problem with his contract,
*  cause he's up there for me too, is that when they inevitably lose at some point in the second,
*  or if they're lucky, the conference championship of this year's playoffs, nobody will say his name.
*  Nobody will mention what his lack of contribution was or whatever he put like, he has just skated
*  this entire deal. Like nobody cares about what he brings to the table and he signed a maximum
*  contract extension with this team. It's kind of crazy. I hate going against a fellow New York
*  city guy, but God damn, man, this is, this is a tough deal. Yeah. Again, playoff player. No
*  question. Just a little too expensive was you got two in a row. Who do you got? There's a couple of
*  guys that I cannot believe have been taken in. I think cause none of us have the balls to take
*  one in particular. I have a few. Um, the first one that comes to mind and to me is Deandre Hunter.
*  Um, and part of this is because Deandre Hunter, Deandre Hunter after this season, he's got four
*  years, his extension kicks in four years, $90 million, right? Four years, $90 million. And more
*  importantly, Bill, a guy who's making 12, $13 million was on this team is way better than him
*  and is killing in Sacramento right now. And that's my guy Red Velvet, Kevin Herder. So that's why
*  this, this particular contract just gnaws at me because they had the guy at this position who was
*  just, just flat out a better player. But was this is what happens when Roman Roy gets to run your
*  team? Is that what's happening with Hawks ownership right now? Hawks are horrible.
*  So yeah, so this, this deal is a bad one in front of that oven. This deal is a bad one. Um,
*  Bill is daring us to get spicy. Wait, wait, I have, I have a quick Deandre Hunter thing. Sure. Go ahead.
*  I'm disappointed, not in you, but in him that he made this list. I really liked Deandre Hunter.
*  I liked his game. I thought he was going to take a big step up this year. He's the classic,
*  a lot of smoke getting blown up his butt about what's going to happen this year,
*  house. Oh, Deandre Hunter, watch out for him breakout year. And it, and I don't know,
*  it'd be easy to just say, well, this is a weird team. I wouldn't want to be a small forward on
*  this weird team, but I don't know. I'm disappointed house. He is a defensive minded guy and we've sort
*  of touted him. Um, and, and he hasn't missed, you know, previously he had a little bit of,
*  of the injury bug, but he's played 59 games, um, this season, but it's turned out to be quiet.
*  And I think some of that has to do with the dysfunction in Atlanta. Who's in charge. I mean,
*  I really can't believe we have three Hawks already. We're only, you know, 12 picks in.
*  But I agree with, with the assessment, the problem with Deandre Hunter is that he cost them a red
*  velvet. Well, and, and 90 million for the next four years. Who do you have for the other one house?
*  All right. Was I going to do it? Somebody's going to do it. I know that bomb is going to be dropped.
*  I got to get spicy for me. It's Michael Porter Jr. Um, again, he got dropped last year too. Another,
*  he's a max level guy. And some people would say, oh, he's not really allowed to play to that level.
*  I just don't, I just don't see it. I don't, I don't see it. And they're going to rely on this guy to
*  be one of their best wing defenders in the playoffs. And if they can't do anything defensively on the
*  wing, it's because Michael Porter Jr. Wasn't doing his job as the second highest paid guy on the team.
*  And so, you know, offensively, I believe in the style that they play. I think it's completely
*  unguardable. I don't think Michael Porter Jr. Needs to be some one-on-one assassin on his team. So
*  it's not really about what he's doing offensively. It's just like, he should be a better rebounder.
*  He should be playing better defense just from his size alone. He should be better at those things.
*  And he's just not, and oftentimes it feels like he's just going through the motions out there.
*  And, you know, part of this is my sensitivity to the fact that I picked the Nuggets to win the
*  championship this year and I need Michael Porter to come through. I know he's their swing guy.
*  Well, you didn't tell that you didn't say the contract. Oh, so after this year, there's three
*  years, $105 million left on the deal. So that's, I have it on spot track. It's, I have, this is year
*  one. It's five years for 179, but the fifth year has partial guarantees in it. Right.
*  Next three years guaranteed 33, 36, 38.3. Listen, here's the problem with Michael Porter Jr.
*  Cause I do think he's, you watch on the certain nights and he'll make a big shot and it's exciting
*  and he does some really fun stuff with Yoke Edge every once in a while. I shouldn't be pleasantly
*  surprised every time he has a good quarter. It feels Toby Harris. Oh cool. Michael Porter,
*  Michael Porter played well for an hour. Like I shouldn't be psyched about it. A lot of Tobias
*  Harris vibes with that one. As far as impact on a night to night basis, but yeah. Any Porter takes?
*  Any what? Do you have any Michael Porter Jr. takes or do you want to just do your pick?
*  Well, I really do think that what I was saying is the case there, their playoff fortunes really
*  reside on that dude's shoulders and we haven't seen enough to like really feel confident as
*  these playoffs are on a four game losing streak and he is the swing. He's the fulcrum player.
*  I believe, I mean, Narcissus is going to get his. MPJ has got to play crazy defense. He's got to
*  average double digit rebounds and he's got to knock down those threes for Denver to go on the run
*  that we kind of imagined they were capable of. Counter just from somebody who watches a lot of
*  nuggets games. Porter 17 and five. 41.5% from three this year. I'm more worried about Murray
*  watching the nuggets the last two weeks than I am about Porter because I don't know what happened
*  with with Murray, but we all agree that Michael Porter makes too much money. How soon do you have
*  next? This feels like low hanging fruit. Maybe even a cop out. Kyle Lowry is still going to make 60
*  million bucks. You know, he has two for 58. Yeah, yeah. In the face. It's a tough deal.
*  Can't get on the floor. Can't can't help Miami get over the hump. I don't like to do what I'm about
*  to do, but dude never looks in shape. You know, I understand the injury component of it and we have
*  and everything like that, but you can be in shape and be injured at the same time that that is
*  they're not mutually exclusive. He looks like he's rolling in at the Y and you know, if he rolled on
*  the floor at the Y, you're like, OK, he's the guy you would underestimate who would come in and start
*  making 30 footers in your grill. I've made that mistake before, but he's not he's not rolling in
*  the Y Miami needs him to make a viable playoff push and he can't get on the floor and make that
*  contribution. They really miss him. He could he would really the version of Kyle Lowry from two
*  years ago would be incredible for this Miami team, but he can't play. So I have nothing to add. I
*  think it's a little too high for him. There's a couple really tasty choices left on the board.
*  There's a few tasty ones. I'm going to go next. This is an easy one. I honestly great value. Can't
*  believe he hasn't gone yet. Three years, 36 million doesn't play anymore, even though he's on
*  one of the most fun teams in the league. Rashawn Holmes doesn't play. They don't have a backup
*  center. He's right there. They just paid him an extension. Guess what? No, thanks, Rashawn. You
*  just you stay over there. We're going to have fun and score one hundred and twenty nine points a
*  game. Just cheer us on. And it's this is one more. They will be moving this one and shopping. I know
*  they were shopping at the deadline, too, but they will be shopping this one hard. Yeah, he's a he's
*  an offense only player on a team that already has plenty of it. And it's like, dude, we need some
*  level of defense at some point here. And Rashawn Holmes has kind of never been that dude. Although
*  I've liked him in the past. There was times where he was one of the only bright spot watching the
*  Kings. But yeah, he's he's a bit slightly overpaid for what they're asking him to do at this point.
*  Honestly, I think he would have been a good tanking weapon for one of the like the rocket
*  should have like pursued him to add him to the list. He would have been good. My only quibble
*  with with drafting him here is in some respects, it seems like it's addition by subtraction for
*  the Kings, like not playing them. Him has given them the rotation that works for them. Like he's
*  not stealing minutes from from anybody. And it's only 12 million bucks, which to me, like in the in
*  the big scheme of things, you almost can you can whiff on a player. That's all. Well, since house
*  just challenged my manhood, I'm going to drop the bomb that the two of you who's we're just afraid
*  to do it. We all stared at it for a couple rounds. Now, none of us had the balls. Guess what? I just
*  put my balls on the table. Zion Williamson, six years, 207 million.
*  He is an unbelievable basketball player, 207 million dollars, and he cannot play for four weeks
*  in a row. And I think we have three drafted five and we almost had 20 players. I would be very scared
*  to cut that check if I was a New Orleans owner, even though I get all the upside and he's an
*  amazing basketball player. Can he stay in the courthouse? Can we see him stay in the court?
*  See, he's in the same category for me as Lonzo. It's a sad contract, not a bad contract,
*  because the potential that he showed us in the, you know, 230 game stints that we got out of him
*  had him appearing as a transcendent player. Right. I mean, we he had numbers that were
*  top five all time NBA history kind of offensive efficiency, points in the paint kind of
*  trajectory. He just can't play. So it is, he's still super young. I give him enormous credit for
*  listening over the summer. He got in great shape. Really? He showed up in shape. He was ready to
*  kick ass. New Orleans, where were they? 23 and 12. You know, at one point they were third in the
*  West at one point. I am going to lose a ton of money on the Pelicans this season because I was
*  so bullish on their prospects. I thought for sure. You might even have a Zion MVP bet somewhere.
*  No, I didn't do that one. I didn't bet a lot of guys for MVP. Zion wasn't one of them,
*  but it's a bummer. What I say about Zion, it's a bummer. He's young. Maybe there's still some hope.
*  Yeah. The stuff about him not staying on the floor is tough, but I think the difference between him
*  and Lonzo Ball is fair or not, the perception that throughout his career, Zion hasn't been exactly
*  dedicated to his fitness. And it's hard to separate that lack of dedication from his injuries. I feel
*  like the two go hand in hand and maybe I might be wrong. Like, you know, spoiler alert, I'm no doctor,
*  but I think there's a perception that a lot of his injury problems stem from his lack of,
*  you know, nutritional stuff, the working out stuff. And when we say he was in shape coming
*  into this season, I would say he's in shape compared to the seasons before that. Not in
*  shape actually. Right. And so that's my thing about Zion is like, man, is he even going to make it to
*  the end of that deal? His body anyway. That's why I question that. That's why I think Bill makes a
*  solid point. This is an inspired pick for sure. But I was thinking about somebody else, honestly.
*  I think the sad contract, bad contract is first of all, really good gimmick. Congratulations to me
*  for thinking of it. I was very excited. I still got it. I still throw a fastball every once in a while.
*  The Zion thing makes me sad more than mad at the figure. Certainly wouldn't blame them for
*  what they paid him at Zion Williamson. But I just look at it like LeBron got plantar fasciitis,
*  which everyone else in the league gets in your seasons over. And LeBron is Instagramming photos
*  from a hyperbaric chamber. And it's just, he's clearly going to be back in like two weeks and
*  he'll be fine. And if Zion got that injury, we wouldn't see him for like a year and a half.
*  All right, House, you're up. I thought you had somebody else in mind for this. And so I'm going
*  to jump in the pool with both feet. And I don't know if you guys are going to agree or what, but
*  for how old this dude is and what the age through which this extension that he just signed is going
*  to run. Oh my God. Don't disrespect my guy. Oh, he's a one of one. He's a one of one. He is the
*  face of the franchise. He deserves every accolade. But in terms of return, in terms of the
*  fortunes of the franchise, the goals to be the goal to be successful, this contract feels like
*  it's a limiting factor. I am going to say Dame Lillard. I love, I love Dame Dollar. I love him
*  so much. He was an absolute ray of light for Portland through the entire winter from
*  January on up through a top three score in the league. But this contract has him. Hold on,
*  my right leg just caught on firehouse. I just want you to hear this. Well, let me, let me ask,
*  how much money do you think he's going to make in 20, in the 2026, 2027 season? It's like,
*  it starts with a six, right? It starts with a six. Yes, it starts with a six. Now I know that
*  we're good. There's a new collective bargaining agreement coming. There's a new media deal coming.
*  And at some point, $60 million is, it could feel like just a regular old upper tier contract,
*  but then it's going to be 36 turning 37. There's not a huge track record of smallish
*  shooting guards who are still at the peak efficiency at that point in their career.
*  Love Dame Dollar. Don't misunderstand what I'm saying here. It's just too rich. It's a lifetime
*  achievement award contract. That's all. His extension was two years, 121.7 million was.
*  If Dame did a diss track of House, would that be the highlight of your career, my career,
*  House's career, or all three of us at the same time? I would say all three of us at the same time.
*  And the reason why I disagree with House, one, I think Dame Liller's contract is one that a bunch
*  of people would want to jump on with two feet because it's not just this play which the guy
*  dropped 70 something points this year. The two previous years, this is why I disagree with this,
*  and it has to do with the Trey Young stuff. The two previous years where Dame is playing
*  through injury, he's not doing load management, he's not doing this. They had to make him sit
*  games and go get operated on to fix himself. This guy just refuses to not play. And then of course,
*  there's his production, which look, man, Steph is probably better. But like, man, I think Dame is
*  like a half a notch right underneath that. And just as a professional, as somebody who's going to
*  lead your franchise and do the right thing, set the right examples, that kind of stuff gets
*  discounted too much, I think. And so I disagree with you. I understand the take. $63 million.
*  I appreciate the take.
*  And the 26, 27 season is going to be a lot, but I think for the next three seasons,
*  Dame's going to be a $50 million player, for sure.
*  I think it's basically the contract itself, even if you just whited out his name and just said,
*  here's his contract. It's almost like blind has to be in the top 25. $121 million,
*  starting three years from now, makes my sphincter just tighten. All kinds of terrible things can
*  happen to basketball players. It's just, man, that's a lot of money. But House,
*  really appreciate and respect where you went. You have one more pick somehow. What do you got?
*  Oh no, you don't. Waz has two.
*  It's Waz with two.
*  Okay. So my first one, I can't believe you guys have left this on the board.
*  Oh no. Did I miss a pick? I took Zion and then I took, oh, and Holmes. Okay. My bad. Go ahead, Waz.
*  All right. So my pick here is Zach Levine. And that's because the Bulls were hemming and hawing
*  and crying about having to give this guy a deal. Before this, they were just killing this dude in
*  the press. You guys will remember our friend, Brian Windhorse was at the Olympics. The exact
*  Levine about getting a deal done. And Zach Levine said, I just want my respect, AKA pay me the
*  goddamn maximum in money and years. They fought over this over the press. They gave him the deal.
*  Five for 215.
*  Basically. And I think they're going to try this four years and 178 million left.
*  I have worse news for you, Waz. 15% trade kicker.
*  So now if they trade him, that's up to like 245.
*  I think they'll be looking to move him this summer, but I wonder how many teams outside of
*  teams like LA, like I think the Lakers would be willing to do anything for some win now stuff,
*  even if with the long-term ramifications. But like, I wonder who would actually take on
*  Zach Levine at that number. No one. He just, he doesn't really change your life.
*  You know, you have to have excellence already in place for him to make a big deal. I think
*  don't get it twisted. Zach Levine, LeBron, AD, I think that would be incredible.
*  Right. But like on a different kind of team or the Bulls more specifically,
*  they're nothing with him and he's got these lingering knee issues.
*  So yeah, I think the Levine deal might be one in a few years where we'd be like,
*  Holy moly. This is, this is a tough one.
*  I agree that he's a trade candidate this summer.
*  I don't agree that the Lakers will trade for that contract because they already have
*  Anthony Davis and LeBron James in year 21 on their team at that point. And I'm pretty sure
*  you'd want a little stability with your $40 million guy at that point. I can see the nets for him.
*  The nets have all those different pieces and like a three for one, something like that. But
*  I could also see houses wizards. It seems like the kind of contract the wizards would be,
*  they're just kind of on brand for them.
*  Well, if you're looking for a guy who's going to help a franchise, you know, spin its wheels and
*  win about 38 games a season, that ZLs the dude, I will say this in the, in the Bulls defense,
*  the context in which they made that deal. It's understandable.
*  Yeah. And they didn't have a choice. So because, you know, you, it was a 35 game sample with,
*  with Lonzo and it's like, man, this is really could be something. And we've been cheated of
*  it because of the bad injury luck.
*  Waz, you got one more pick. What do you got?
*  I'm trying to see where I will. Okay. I know what I want to do. It's Jonathan Isaac. And this might
*  be bad contract, sad contract, cause he can't stay on the floor. But you know, when you got a guy in
*  your locker room, quoting Bible verses to NBA players, I got to put you on bad contract alert.
*  And so Jonathan Isaac, AKA the preacher man, two years, $34 million still left.
*  They have some else with it though. I think, I think they can get it. There's some partial
*  guarantee stuff with it that I think they can get out of next year.
*  No, no, no. Okay.
*  Two guaranteed, two guaranteed years after this year at 17.4 for a guy who never plays
*  and whose teammates roll their eyes every time he steps into a, the same room as them. So yeah,
*  put, put, put Jonathan Isaac on that list for me.
*  House, what do you got? Maybe we'll do one more, one more round here. What do you got?
*  Oh, good. It's time. I'm ready. I have my guy. Oh no.
*  He's a very important part of the Charmin Celtics. And if he was playing, it might be a different,
*  he could be the coach on the floor that, that the team needs. And he, and he should be the,
*  the enforcer in terms of, of, of force of will. He's got, so he signed a four year,
*  76 and a half million dollar contract. And at the end of this contract, he's going to get paid
*  21 million bucks in 2025, 2026. I mean, if, if Marcus smart could stay on the floor and,
*  you know, help that team fight itself all over again, in terms of some defensive intensity,
*  I might feel like you're getting your money's worth, but who is Marcus smart at this point
*  in his career pod father, I ask you. I mean, the sad thing about what you laid out is
*  whatever physical condition he's in right now, they're actually better off if he's,
*  if he's not playing. Cause he's been that bad and they have Derek white just sitting right there
*  ready to play any crunch time. I've been talking about this for a couple of weeks now. What
*  smarts just look terrible. And it's not like always having a bad game. And this is like every
*  game. He looks bad. The Hawks game. They're just, they're just trying to finish the Hawks game. And
*  he's just coming up with new ways for the Hawks to get the ball back rockets game. He was singularly
*  atrocious and white was sitting there on crunch time. It's been really bad. I do worry,
*  you know, he was awesome last year. He was awesome to start the season,
*  but I do like thinking in football terms, these guys like, you know, like running backs or tight
*  ends or strong safeties that just are in a lot of collisions and a lot of physicality. And all the
*  sudden it goes off a cliff. And I really hope that's not happening with him right now. It's,
*  it's the topic of every conversation I have with every Celtics fan in my life is where I like,
*  what is going on with MarketSmartt? What do you see, Was? Yeah, I, he's, but he's, he goes through
*  these stretches where he can't make a shot and he looks like a complete disaster. But he could
*  always guard somebody in those stretches. Right. And that's the problem. He can't stay in front of
*  people anymore. And that, that's more alarming to me than the, the shot coming and going. Yeah. And
*  that's the real problem is like now he's not this elite. Then he went defensive player the year last
*  year. Was that just last year? You know, now he's just getting abused. You know, I would hope maybe
*  this is just an effort, regular season thing. And then in the playoffs, he had an injury. There's
*  an injury, like I'm just not telling people I'm injured piece of this. That's possible.
*  If that's the case, he should stop playing right now. Take the 10 to 12 games that you need to
*  get right and get right like that, you know, help this team. The Celtics have showed an alarming
*  lack of resilience in the face of physical play. What the Knicks did to them, you know, a couple
*  weeks ago in terms of that overtime, they bullied the Celtics. They bull, though Celtics could not
*  corral a single rebound. The only way they got the ball back in overtime was by fouling Mitchell
*  Robinson, who got every goddamn rebound. Yeah, that Josh Hart just seemed tougher than anyone
*  in the Celtics. There's a problem. There's not a lot of dog in the Celtics team this year. And
*  you think like last year where Grant Williams and smart and Robert Williams were these huge pieces
*  of everything that was happening this year. Grant Williams is getting yanked around and he's been
*  bad for six weeks. Smart. I don't know what's going on. Rob Williams doesn't play. It's pretty rough.
*  All right. I'm going to end this for us. I don't think I'm going to drop a bomb.
*  There's some pretty fun ones on the board still.
*  All right. No, I don't want to feud with the Rockets fans again. I'm going to stay away from
*  that. It's so whiny. It's a whiny fan base. Think about it. I want the Portland fans to know that
*  I love Dave. I don't know. We're all afraid of the aggregated blog. $63 million dollars.
*  It says Dave Blower overpaid. I love him. Oh, okay. Oh, my God. I had somebody on my list that was
*  supposed to go with my top seven and he just went undrafted. I've been a fire like two of my scouts.
*  Youssef Nurcic, four years, 70 million. He's up there. He can't guard anybody.
*  He cannot guard anybody. It's terrible. He's supposed to be the anchor of what they're doing
*  down there. Again, they're right there with Dallas. Just some of the worst defense they can put. It's
*  a layup line against these guys every single night. Yeah, Nurcic. He's up there. Another big man I
*  can't understand. Marvin Bagley, two more years left. 25 mil. Yeah, that's right. Wow. Why is
*  that happening? Then, then, Norm Powell. He's got three years. 60 mil left on his deal. I kind of
*  like Norm though. Norm does come in hot every once in a while. He's a $20 million player. Come on now.
*  Can I read you just all the centers in the league and you tell me you'd just stop me when it's
*  somebody you'd rather have than you'd rather have Nurcic than the center? Than that person?
*  Yokage, Embiid, Sabonis, Adebayo, Anthony Davis, Brooke Lopez, Jared Jackson, Karl Anthony Towns,
*  Vucovic, Kessler, Aitin, Porzingis, Jared Allen, Miles Turner, Pertle, Capella, Horford, Gobert,
*  Robert Williams, Nick Claxton, Jonas Valenshunis, Mark Williams on the unchartered. No,
*  Mark Williams is a rookie. He's gonna be good. He's definitely not better than Kevon Looney.
*  No shot. Steven Adams? No, Steven Adams is the secret to emphasis fortune. Mason Plumlee?
*  All right, now we might be there. Now we're getting there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right,
*  so we're now in the Mason Plumlee, like, Christian Wood? I think Christian Wood is misunderstood.
*  That's tough for Nurcic. I didn't think that Christian Wood and Jason Kidd were going to be
*  a good match. And guess what? They're not a good match. At least Nurcic rebounds, man. But Christian
*  Wood is just a way better offensive player. He's shooting the hell out of the rock. Like, I don't
*  know. But yeah, that's the range. Apologies to Devontae Graham, who has three for 36 left,
*  and Rudy Gay two for 12.6. And Daniel Tice. Daniel Tice can't believe he didn't get drafted.
*  He was where is he? 18 million bucks. Who cares? Two for 18. Nine million bucks a year. Who cares?
*  Gordon Hayward two for 62. He doesn't know what he did wrong not to get drafted.
*  Look, I would say good lately though. I've been watching him lately and he looks so damn good.
*  He looks good. He's somebody he could be trading for in the summer. Yeah. Kevin Porter four for 50.
*  He can't believe he wasn't drafted. And JaVale McGee three for 17. He's a little stunned.
*  PJ Tucker three for 33. The last year he's going to be like he's going to earn all that money in
*  the playoffs. You watch. Right. It's basically a three year deal just for this year. And then
*  last but not least, Johnny Davis two years, 9.9 billion. That's not nice. Why do we have to end
*  on that note? That's just a blown pick. It's not surprising. It's Washington doing the drafting.
*  Why do we have to end on that?
