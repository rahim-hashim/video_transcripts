# Predicting the Future of Sports With Derek Thompson  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [July 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGG81l_Ka24)
*  All right, so there's a concept that I recently learned about
*  And I'm sorry to begin this in in academic world, but it'll it'll hit sports very very soon
*  There's a concept in sociology. I recently learned about called sport space. I think you might like this
*  It's the idea that culture only has room
*  For three to four sports at scale at any one time and this term comes from a book called offsides
*  Which is an effort thing to explain why soccer is the world's favorite pastime
*  But a distant also ran in the US behind, you know football baseball
*  Basketball, maybe hockey and the thesis from this book offside was in the space between 1870 and 1920
*  America's sport space was filled
*  baseball football
*  basketball is invented takes over and
*  America at the time was very interested in honing an identity that was distinct from Europe and certainly distinct from England
*  And so we resisted soccer and for the first 100 years football and basketball and baseball
*  Crowded out the game of soccer essentially and idea and boxing
*  Yeah, absolutely. Right, especially in the in the early 1900s mid 1900s, too
*  But so this idea of a fixed sports space would explain why it's really hard for sports to break into mass mass culture
*  Right. We don't really have a lot of earthquakes
*  We have a lot of some like long tectonic shifts, but not a lot of birth earthquakes
*  and this is my long wind-up to say that as big a deal as the Caitlin Clark phenomenon is
*  I
*  wonder if
*  15 years from now
*  Right, it'll be clear. They were actually systematically under rating
*  What a big deal Caitlin Clark's entry in the WNBA is like we're treating the story as if the WNBA is having a boomlet
*  As if this is the top but what if it's the beginning?
*  So I was doing some research on the differences between the WNBA and NBA
*  Rights deal that was just signed in the new WNBA deal
*  The women's league gets about 20 million dollars a year and tell me if you think if any of this is wrong
*  I I'm not an expert on this. I just did the research and the WNBA gets about 20 million dollars a year
*  NBA deal is worth closer to seven billion dollars a year
*  That means the NBA is getting 35 times more money per year from the television networks than the WNBA
*  35 times more is the NBA really?
*  Statistically mathematically
*  35 times more popular than the WNBA is right now
*  The NCAA women's tournament beat the NCAA double the NCAA men's
*  Tournament, although it got like 99% less money the typical NBA game on ESPN ABC gets 1.6 million viewers in
*  June ESPN reported that WNBA games are averaging
*  1.3 million viewers not 35 times less like 25% less
*  Caitlin Clark Angel Reese games are averaging 2.3 million viewers more than the typical NBA game
*  What if this is one of those?
*  once in a century
*  earthquake moments in the sports space
*  what if the WNBA has crashed the gates and
*  Rather than thinking oh, this is a nice story. This is a neat story. No actually maybe
*  this is such a big story that the current deals just signed will be seen as
*  laughably
*  incoherent in five years
*  What if in a few years the WNBA is right at par if not?
*  Getting more viewers per game than the NBA. That's not so crazy considering
*  25% less now and again the gap is 30 is a factor of 35
*  So in terms of what they're making so I am really interested in the possibility
*  That as much attention as obviously is being brought to the WNBA
*  It's actually not nearly enough. We're in a once-in-a-century moment in American sports
*  Yeah, you could feel with Caitlin because it there were similarities to Tiger Woods and some other like
*  Phenomenons that just felt like this is something
*  This isn't a fad. This isn't like a short-term thing. This is something that feels different. It's it's tilted
*  Whatever the landscape was so I asked people I didn't understand why they didn't split the WNBA out of their deal
*  Right, and I I think the reason and I'm not reporting this and I'm not positive, but I think the reason is
*  Because the NBA basically funded the WNBA forever, right?
*  They always shoehorned it into their deals the league was not popular the league was not doing well and they were basically like
*  force-feeding
*  The networks to carry it at it like like it was worth more than it probably was right until
*  You get through the mid-mid 2010s
*  Like the league hit this point where Tarasi was the best player in the league and didn't even play one season because she could make
*  More money elsewhere. So the first 20 years
*  They really put the time in and kept it alive and funded it and spent money on it and
*  to me the move should have been because they could see what was happening to pull the WNBA rights out and
*  Try to sell it for as much as they could but I feel like they were like, you know what we spent all this money
*  Keeping this league alive and funding it since 1996 whenever it was
*  That we're gonna shoehorn it into this deal because we want the benefits of it and then 10 11 years from now
*  If the WNBA keeps going the way we'll go then we'll shoehorn it out. So it's almost like
*  This was kind of their tip
*  On the restaurant bill for everything they did and I don't think they should have done it that way
*  I think they should have spun it out and beat everybody wants rights everybody wants
*  I think they could have gotten way more than whatever the number was assigned for and it just felt greedy to me
*  I didn't get it
*  When it's the question is greedy on behalf of whom it's greedy on behalf of the NBA
*  Whose proceeds are going to the owners and the players?
*  But it's not going to make any sense if five to ten years from now
*  The WNBA has essentially the same ratings in the NBA. It's gonna lead to a labor strike is what's gonna happen
*  The that's exactly where I was going. That's where we're heading in the next two years
*  if there's a world if there's a world where Kaylin Clark and Angel Reese and and and
*  Jay Wilson are all making 35 times less at least right now
*  They're making 600 times less than NBA players if they're making like through it still making 30 times less than NBA players
*  And they're getting the same TV ratings. Well, how about course they're gonna strike an alternate league
*  I mean, this is how the ABA started right the NBA players underpaid didn't make enough money
*  Didn't really have some basic labor stuff in their favor until they unionized in 64
*  but then the ABA came in 67 and guess what all of a sudden all this shit changed and
*  Salaries went up by four times and then in the 70s all the sudden NBA players were worth three times what they used to be worth
*  Mm-hmm. I think
*  The thing that I think is gonna happen is I think somebody's gonna try to form an alternate league because it's not like all of these
*  WNBA players are tied to their teams forever, right? So you could start a league like you know what?
*  We have more money over here like that that would seem to be the move and I don't I personally don't understand why the woman's soccer
*  franchises are worth like they just paid 250 million for the LA one and
*  expansion
*  Ones for the WNBA were like at 110 million
*  I don't understand why soccer is worth more than WNBA because the TV ratings say the opposite
*  the interest on social media and the interest even in
*  In the sports world just says the opposite so yeah, I'm with you
*  So we both we both feel like something funky is gonna happen over the next couple years because of this deal
*  it doesn't it doesn't make any sense if I I'm part if I'm part of a company and
*  I know that I am just as successful and
*  Just as lucrative as an employee at some other company who's making
*  35 times more than me
*  Why in the world would I stick with that company it doesn't make any sense of course
*  Something is going to happen that has the potential
*  To blow up the WNBA as the rights deal exists and in that respect I think you know to take your tip analogy
*  This is just incredibly short-sighted if you think you're essentially just saying I'm taking the tip on all the benefits that I gave you
*  For the last 20 years. This is your way of saying. Thank you. Okay. Well, you know Caitlin Clark
*  Was she alive when the WNBA started well, they asked me to put it in where it's like it's a four-year
*  Four of the 11 years and then we'll revisit the WNBA side as an out cause should done something like that. All right, we're aligned I
*  Have I'll make this quick because we got to go I
*  My my future of everything. I think we're in peak athlete hagiography era
*  Hmm. This is it. We have player pods where people just get to say whatever they want
*  Nobody challenges them. Nobody asked questions. They just get to be like, yeah, we would have won the title that year
*  There's no facts brought in
*  We have these infomercial documentaries and the all-access shows that usually somebody involved as an executive producer their production company is
*  we have
*  these biopics about celebrities that I'm sure coming for athletes to and then we have
*  These social media clips from the pods where these things are spat out in 90-second clips
*  where it's like, you know, Joel and bead saying stuff like yeah, if
*  If Jason Tatum has a super team if I went five for 20
*  You know, we lose every game and nobody sitting with them can be like but Joel you've only played
*  433 games in 10 years
*  And Jason Tatum's beaten you three times in the playoffs. How can you say that?
*  Nobody challenges everything and it's just we're just in hagiography mode now
*  And it's all everybody's gonna have their own long documentary series that spins whatever their career is
*  Even the people that weren't that successful now have these pods where they talk about themselves like they were like these
*  major amazing things the inability for anyone to challenge some of this stuff feels like we're just creating this alternate version of sports history
*  That's just kind of happening over here and I hope people see it
*  Why do you think this trend is gonna end? It's that it's gonna get worse. I thought you said it was it was PK geography
*  Yeah, I think we are it's it's is it we've been feeling
*  How I feel about conspiracy theories, it's it's just going to keep happening because all of the incentives push for it
*  I you know, I was watching
*  Love Island USA with my wife and
*  There were some accusations that flew around on this show like on every on you know reality show dating show
*  That some people are just in it to become influencers
*  But if you think about it
*  Athletes are in a perfect situation to become influencers
*  They're they've already won the lottery of fame people talk about them on ESPN people talk about them on podcasts
*  They're already famous. And so if everyone sees
*  fame as
*  A road to becoming an influencer
*  Then every NBA star in Gen Z and gen alpha whenever whatever is coming next are also going to see that their NBA fame
*  Buys them a ticket that they can enter into the lottery of potentially becoming a cultural influencer
*  But you can get a bunch of extra money from so as I see it
*  There's a way in which if you were a manager or an agent for some
*  young
*  smart
*  funny articulate athlete
*  2223 who cares if they're famous tell them to start a podcast
*  The worst that happens is that you stop recording the best that happens that you become famous
*  So I think everything is pushing towards this. I think that you're gonna see more
*  Yeah, it's funny to think that in the 1980s
*  I think closer than you have probably had this conversation many times, but the 1970s 1980s
*  Selling out was considered a bad thing today. It's entirely flipped selling out is a good thing, you know making a
*  Merchandising yourself making a brand of yourself is just what everybody does
*  So this world of if you're a sports star, you can also be an influencer
*  This is this is just the start well we had in the 40s and 50s they would have autobiographies and
*  Then in the 50s and 60s and 70s like Sports Illustrated
*  Sport magazine some of these places they write these first-person essays, right and me and they were always will chamberlain had some great ones
*  I remember when I was researching my book will chamberlain
*  He basically created what the player podcasts are now or just like I should have eight titles and my teammates let me down
*  Just say crazy shit and it was like nobody checking him because it was his first person essay
*  But in the in probably mid 70s on
*  Through the 90s we there was there was a balance to all this stuff
*  And that balance is now gone and the reason I mentioned this is like think about how crazy it is to produce
*  documentaries about yourself
*  Right, like we don't we wouldn't blink if it's an autobiography. It's like I wrote this autobiography you're reading it
*  You're like, all right. I'm gonna take this with a grain of salt
*  It's an autobiography
*  But now people are producing documentaries about themselves and there's no grain of salt and you really saw this with the Patriots one
*  It's like here's the history of the Patriots. It's our story and it's like now this is Bob Kraft's version of the story
*  This isn't a documentary that's balanced and does all these different things
*  Like can you imagine like if if you're like, hey, I have an announcement to make I'm doing a four-part documentary about myself
*  It's produced by my new company Derek Thompson productions
*  And it's a four-part
*  Documentary about the impact that I've had on journalism people be like what the fuck is going on
*  You're producing it yourself. That's insane. But that's where we've landed with sports and culture
*  That's where we've landed with these biopics about Bob Marley out John. Oh, like it's like what are we doing?
*  none of this stuff has any sort of
*  Real merit, I don't know. I just I hate all of it
*  I'm not sure I like it either. I do think it's interesting to think about
*  Self-produced documentaries as really just being the 21st century version of autobiographies
*  I'd never quite thought it is but we don't really have a moral issue with people writing autobiographies and yet we know I think I think
*  You're right. There is it does feel something icky about a self-produced documentary about yourself
*  About yourself, but maybe you're seeing all these all-access shows that are gonna happen like there's
*  17 camera crews following all the Olympic teams
*  It's like are we really gonna get the authentic like what happens if Joel Embiid gets benched?
*  Right in the last two games of the Olympics. Are we gonna be covering that in our all-access on the USA?
*  What the deep no, yeah, so I just hope people
*  understand the difference between
*  content where somebody can at least
*  You know
*  They there might be a tiny bit of journalism there or stuff. That's just all access
*  Infomercial stuff which is where we're heading with basically everything. Yeah, it's marketing right it's time for me to go
*  This new era might be out
