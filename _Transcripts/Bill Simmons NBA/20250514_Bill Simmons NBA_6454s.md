# Could the Celtics Rally Without Jayson Tatum? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=0.0s)]
*  This part of the podcast, a little before seven PT, once upon a time, you knew him [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=26.52s)]
*  as the czar of reality TV and he ran all of the audio and video for Grantland, a [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=31.08s)]
*  job that many people have tried to take credit for, but I can promise you he did [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=36.2s)]
*  it a hundred percent himself. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  Now he is the host of the mismatch, along with Chris Vernon, among many other [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=43.44s)]
*  things, my guy, Dave Jacoby is here. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=47.44s)]
*  Die easy. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=49.36s)]
*  Nick's fan. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=50.64s)]
*  I did book this before we knew the results of game five, just for the record. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  You're an asshole. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=55.16s)]
*  It's, it's. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=57.28s)]
*  I just really could have gone two ways. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  I'm not really happy the way it went, to be honest with you, you know, I'm really [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=63.6s)]
*  not happy with the way it was. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=66.64s)]
*  What did you think was going to happen? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=67.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=68.72s)]
*  I mean, I guarantee you didn't think we would be calling this on the podcast [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=68.92s)]
*  title for this episode, the Luke cornet game, but that was, that was the outcome. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=72.4s)]
*  X Nick, by the way, Westchester Nick legend. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=79.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=81.80000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=82.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=82.44s)]
*  I remember hearing from Nick, it's been like, there's this guy in Westchester. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=83.64s)]
*  He's like seven feet tall. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=86.8s)]
*  He hits threes and he's got ball skills. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=87.91999999999999s)]
*  I was like, it used to be his corner was the three point shooting. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=89.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=92.63999999999999s)]
*  He doesn't even shoot threes now. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=92.96s)]
*  But no, um, I do think the Knicks will eventually win the series, but I had a [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=95.6s)]
*  feeling they would lose this one. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=101.63999999999999s)]
*  And now it just, I don't feel good about anything right now, because now it's just [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=103.08s)]
*  like, you have to win game seven. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=108.19999999999999s)]
*  My game, Nick's group chat, game six. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=110.6s)]
*  You're right. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=113.08s)]
*  My Nick's group chat has gone from, we need to trade for Yannis. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=113.68s)]
*  I ran around game three to who do you think would be a better matchup in the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=118.52s)]
*  finals, the thunder or the wolves to must win game six in the garden. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=122.92s)]
*  There was no, no, like four hours there of, are you guys worried about the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=130.76s)]
*  Pacers at all? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=135.56s)]
*  And then people reassuring each other. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=136.44s)]
*  No, no, we're not worried about them at all. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  No, none of that. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=140.44000000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=142.96s)]
*  Cause the Pacers are really good. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=143.96s)]
*  Oh, the Pacers. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=146.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=147.4s)]
*  Uh, the Pacers are really good. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=147.88000000000002s)]
*  And also the, uh, you know, I revisited the Pacers Nick series from last season [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=149.0s)]
*  and I had to like sort of freshen up on it because I remember game seven was such [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  a big deal and everyone was hurt and OG tried to play just like Brunson's hurt [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  and no one was there, but like game one and game two, kind of like this series [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=162.68s)]
*  that came down to the end. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=166.28s)]
*  And remember Carlisle got kicked out of a game. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=168.44s)]
*  I forgot about that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=170.56s)]
*  And he's like small market teams deserve fouls too. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=171.8s)]
*  There's some chippiness. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=174.8s)]
*  There was some real like stuff there. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=175.8s)]
*  It was a good series. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  Worse if it's Pacers next this year, it'll be even worse. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=179.8s)]
*  And let's be honest, it's probably going to be Pacers. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  I'll just tell you my mindset. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=186.4s)]
*  First of all, I was hearing my dad was there. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=188.20000000000002s)]
*  Um, and it was a late arriving crowd cause it was a seven o'clock start [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=190.76000000000002s)]
*  plus a shitload of traffic. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  And there were some Nick fans because I think some Celtic fans after the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=197.24s)]
*  Tatum injury were like putting the tickets on so you could hear the next things. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=200.52s)]
*  They show chalamet at one point courtside and I, and it turned into a, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=205.0s)]
*  not in our house. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=210.12s)]
*  We can't let this happen. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=211.12s)]
*  Every time you heard the next three or some sort of good next play in the first, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=212.4s)]
*  you know, 40 minutes of the game, first like real time, 40 minutes, and you [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=217.0s)]
*  could hear the loud Nick's fans. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=222.04000000000002s)]
*  And it was like, this is really awful. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=223.84s)]
*  If the next like, when this their fans are celebrating it cuts to the end, the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=226.52s)]
*  wide shot only the next fans are left. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=230.56s)]
*  Chalamet is pointing at people. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=233.08s)]
*  I was like, I just, we got to win this. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=235.52s)]
*  It turned into Hoosiers and the Celtics rose to the challenge. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=237.24s)]
*  Jacoby. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=240.08s)]
*  They did. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=241.16s)]
*  It was a, it was a good Celtics game. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=241.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean, we'll talk about the basketball stuff in a second, but I, I do want to [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  say, uh, I heard the chalamet listens to the podcasts and I'm very excited about [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=247.12s)]
*  that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=251.44s)]
*  I'm excited that he's supporting the Knicks. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=251.72s)]
*  Bringing the Kardashian element. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=253.68s)]
*  Wasn't my favorite thing to happen in game four. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=256.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=260.0s)]
*  Like, uh, I'm just going to say, like, I love that you're here, Timothy [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  Chalamet. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=265.28s)]
*  I love you support the Knicks when he went to road games and sat next to [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=265.71999999999997s)]
*  Stiller behind the Pistons bench in Detroit. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=268.52s)]
*  I was like, all right, I love this, you know, and the game, yes, I was like, I [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=271.6s)]
*  love this, but it was when, when you bring a girlfriend, that's fine. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=277.76s)]
*  But your girlfriend's sister, and then it becomes about them and their outfits. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=281.32s)]
*  And you know, it's going to sort of like make the press. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=283.84s)]
*  I didn't love the Kardashian element that we saw. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=286.24s)]
*  You remember once upon a time our guy, Ben Affleck, Oh, three range Red Sox [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=291.2s)]
*  had in one of world series and over decades. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=297.12s)]
*  And he brought JLo Yankee fan grew up in the Bronx, literally called Jenny [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=299.32s)]
*  from the Bronx and brought her into the good Red Sox seats for Red Sox Yankees. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=305.48s)]
*  And it was like, that was when the arm turned on Affleck for a little bit. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=310.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=313.52s)]
*  It's like, it's your buddy that has a girlfriend who golfs. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=313.6s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=318.84s)]
*  It's like, it's like, I'm so excited that your girlfriend golfs. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=319.56s)]
*  Like I'm, I'm sad that she's gonna be joining us, but it's going to change the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=322.92s)]
*  vibe. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=325.44s)]
*  That's sort of how I felt about the Kardashians being at the Knicks game. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=326.32s)]
*  We're not going to have our buddy to have nine beers and he's throwing up behind [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=329.08s)]
*  the tent pole and asking the caddy master for afterwards. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=332.24s)]
*  We're going straight home. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=335.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=337.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=337.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=337.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=337.76s)]
*  I didn't love the Kardashian. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=337.92s)]
*  I'll be put like, I will say this is, um, the Celtics made appropriate [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  adjustments and played good basketball tonight. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=342.96000000000004s)]
*  And I love the way that they attacked the paint and just sort of like put the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=344.68s)]
*  pressure on the next they did. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=347.88s)]
*  Well, I kept, you know, from, from the moment Tatum's tragic injury happened [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=349.0s)]
*  when we found out the results. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  And then I got some people in my life are like, is there a Ewing [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=355.8s)]
*  theory possibilities here? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=358.8s)]
*  And just for the record, um, first of all, love Jason Tatum. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=360.08000000000004s)]
*  Second of all, not everyone loves Jason Tatum. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=363.52000000000004s)]
*  First of all, love Jason Tatum. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=365.48s)]
*  Second of all, not eligible because they won the title with them last year. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=366.68s)]
*  The whole point of the Ewing theory is the team never won the title. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=369.32s)]
*  Best player gets hurt. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=372.56s)]
*  And then the team rises to the occasion without them in some way. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=374.52s)]
*  With that said, it did open the door for some stuff that has been pretty [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=378.0s)]
*  frustrating about this Celtics team where they all had to band together. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=383.64s)]
*  They had to get a little more creative offensively. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=386.84s)]
*  There was a lot more cutting. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=389.64s)]
*  There was a lot more ball movement. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=391.36s)]
*  And some of the stuff that would handicap this team in the past where it was either [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=393.4s)]
*  Tatum or Brown with the ball, just dribbling, especially when they had a lead [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=397.04s)]
*  and the lead would start to further away. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=401.2s)]
*  And then it just turned into a one-on-one basketball. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=403.6s)]
*  That never happened in this game. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=405.88s)]
*  Cause the guards were more involved. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=407.68s)]
*  Cornet was cutting. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=409.4s)]
*  The passing was really good. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=410.8s)]
*  Like I, that was by far the best game they played in the playoffs. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=412.28s)]
*  I think. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=415.56s)]
*  I think so too. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=416.68s)]
*  And it did help that Derek White hit like seven threes to start the game. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=417.4s)]
*  That always helps. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=420.6s)]
*  When the guy's shooting out of Derek White's ass. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=421.2s)]
*  The Nick said Josh Hart made more threes in a half hour than he made [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=425.88s)]
*  all playoffs that felt like. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=429.8s)]
*  I will say that there is something to be said for you drive the car. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=432.4s)]
*  I'll drive the car. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=437.76s)]
*  You drive the car. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=438.64s)]
*  I'll drive the car. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=439.48s)]
*  But when you have, when you take the Tatum element out of the Celtics offense, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=441.08s)]
*  it becomes a little bit more like I'm driving the car and I'll dictate how [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=445.24s)]
*  things are going to go and I'm going to spread the ball around. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=448.91999999999996s)]
*  It's not my turn, your turn. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=451.2s)]
*  It's my turn. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=452.59999999999997s)]
*  And then we're going to spread to role players. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=453.56s)]
*  That's what the Knicks offense is with Brunson sort of at the helm. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=455.03999999999996s)]
*  And I think that is what led to them playing this, this sort of more [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=458.47999999999996s)]
*  democratic offense and you know, it also didn't hurt that Derek White hit all [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=463.44s)]
*  this up. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=467.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=468.24s)]
*  Well, they had to get more creative because Tatum becomes the security blanket [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  that you can always rely on. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=472.44s)]
*  Cause he's, you know, can create a shot whenever he wants, but now, Hey, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=473.56s)]
*  Drew Holliday should probably post up a little bit more. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=477.36s)]
*  Let's try a couple of those. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=479.48s)]
*  Let's set picks for Derek White and hat. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=480.88s)]
*  So there was some stuff that was happening. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=482.96s)]
*  That was some really good basketball. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=485.03999999999996s)]
*  I also think this version of the Knicks, I think they're going to have some good [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=486.68s)]
*  one-on-one defenders, but as a team defense thing, this has been a problem [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=490.71999999999997s)]
*  for them all year. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=493.96s)]
*  They're using gets it. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=495.47999999999996s)]
*  They were attacking towns. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=496.36s)]
*  They got towns into foul trouble. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=497.84s)]
*  Then, uh, that's not true. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=500.12s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=501.52s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=502.24s)]
*  Well, they did get, they did not get towns into foul trouble. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=503.0s)]
*  They did. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=505.64s)]
*  It towns got himself into foul trouble too. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=506.36s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=509.44s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=511.0s)]
*  Carl, did you see what's called the foul on him? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=512.88s)]
*  Like, well, they did a good job of having players with the basketball near towns [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=516.72s)]
*  as he had spasms and rain into people. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=520.84s)]
*  The first foul, he was setting a screen and again, none of these [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=523.4399999999999s)]
*  fouls affect the play, like none of them do. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=527.4s)]
*  He's setting a screen and then like, it's an illegal screen. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=530.2s)]
*  It wasn't even like around the ball. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=532.28s)]
*  It wasn't even like the point of attack. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=533.6s)]
*  And the second one, Perseus is coming across the lane and he hits [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=535.36s)]
*  him like he's like a tight end checking a linebacker on the way. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=539.12s)]
*  I said, what are you doing? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=542.92s)]
*  It's like, again, Carl, KP is not a threat. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=544.24s)]
*  Like, why are you doing this in the middle of the lane? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=548.32s)]
*  I don't understand these fouls. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=551.32s)]
*  Then the third foul, he gets his shot blocked. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=553.2s)]
*  And then he, I tried yet by Jared, but then he grabs Eric Wayne, throws him out [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=557.76s)]
*  of the way because he's embarrassed. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=562.08s)]
*  You got his shot blocked. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=563.72s)]
*  So when you say the Celtics put him in foul trouble, I say [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=565.12s)]
*  that is complete bullshit and not true. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=568.88s)]
*  Carl is he towns can't help himself, dude. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=571.28s)]
*  He's got a real like mental problem. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=574.4399999999999s)]
*  He's got like a mental block with this. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=576.52s)]
*  And he goes through stretches where it seems like he's figured it out, but he [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=578.64s)]
*  hasn't and I'm going to very quickly give you a quick analogy I gave on the [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=581.16s)]
*  mismatch, which was like, it's like a finance guy going to the strip club and [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=585.2s)]
*  going to the champagne room and getting roofied and spending $20,000 on his [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=589.68s)]
*  credit card and then waking up the next day and realizing it. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=594.32s)]
*  And then around four o'clock that day, going back to the same strip club the [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=597.2s)]
*  next night, like, when are you going to learn dude? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=600.44s)]
*  Like, when are you going to learn? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=603.4s)]
*  If you went back to the strip joint every night, five nights in a row is what [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=605.92s)]
*  Carly did towns did tonight. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=610.28s)]
*  All his body was developing, developing a resistance to roofies. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=611.72s)]
*  It was actually like, not working as well against him because he kept going back. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=615.8s)]
*  Carly did towns was getting fouls where he was challenging people that were [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=619.04s)]
*  driving to the basket, trying to score at the rim. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=623.2s)]
*  I would be like, that's fine. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=625.4s)]
*  But if you look at his fouls tonight, like the other one who was under the [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=626.6800000000001s)]
*  hoop on a rebound, none of these are like on the ball plays at the rim or [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=630.52s)]
*  none of them are even questionable. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=635.88s)]
*  Well, I had some Knicks fans in my life who were, I won't name them, who were [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=638.04s)]
*  very upset about Tony brothers in the third quarter, just putting fouls on Brunson. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=641.6s)]
*  I thought four of the five fouls were like no brainer. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=647.4s)]
*  You had to call him cause the one where he, he fouled Derek White's elbow with [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=650.4s)]
*  his face. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=654.92s)]
*  That's, I always have a problem with that call because I'm not sure where your [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=655.68s)]
*  face is supposed to go. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=658.68s)]
*  If somebody's diving into you, but ironically, the person who benefits the [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=659.68s)]
*  most from that call and the flip side of it is Jaylen Brunson. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=663.12s)]
*  Cause he gets a lot of fouls that way where he just lurches into guys and. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=666.1999999999999s)]
*  You know, your body can only do so many things when you're over six feet [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=670.9599999999999s)]
*  tall and standing up, the elbows coming at your face. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=674.9599999999999s)]
*  It's probably going to hit your face. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=679.0s)]
*  You can't like do the matrix. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=680.48s)]
*  Well, also Brent Brunson, and again, like I'm a Nick fan, but I'm [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=681.88s)]
*  objective about basketball. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=684.68s)]
*  He put his chin like on his shoulder. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=685.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=688.3599999999999s)]
*  Like you're putting your chin right there. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=688.76s)]
*  You kind of know what's going to happen. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=692.16s)]
*  That was the only one that I thought was the shaky call. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=693.24s)]
*  So there's some big picture Celtic stuff and then we could talk about the Knicks. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=694.88s)]
*  Piece. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=699.8s)]
*  Actually, let's talk about the Knicks pieces first, just to mix it up. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=700.16s)]
*  So the Knicks hasn't been the most fun 21st century, right? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=704.8399999999999s)]
*  And finally think all of these different things have broken this year for them, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=708.9200000000001s)]
*  including, um, unfortunately for the Celtics and for the NBA, but this [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=712.64s)]
*  Tatum injury is obviously a huge competitive advantage for the Knicks. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=716.84s)]
*  The seas have parted. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=721.24s)]
*  They were plus 700 before the series. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=722.1600000000001s)]
*  Um, they stole a couple of fourth quarters. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=725.32s)]
*  I thought they played really well in the second half of the, of, of [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=727.5600000000001s)]
*  game four deserved to win. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=730.36s)]
*  They get this break with the Tatum injury. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=731.88s)]
*  Now they're heading into the final finals of the East. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=734.52s)]
*  If they win this, they don't have to play Cleveland. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=737.32s)]
*  They get to play Indiana and get revenge on them. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=740.24s)]
*  So everything's aligning and then they blow this game. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=743.48s)]
*  And now we're going to MSG on Friday and there's a lot of DNA now. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=747.9200000000001s)]
*  Swimming in the, in the pool. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=752.88s)]
*  There hasn't been a lot of happy memories the last 25 years. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=754.96s)]
*  And I just wonder, you can't say DNA swimming in the pool with happy [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=758.32s)]
*  not go to bad, bad places. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=762.44s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=764.36s)]
*  My bad. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=765.48s)]
*  I know that's, that was once a frequent porn search years. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=766.2s)]
*  But yeah. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=773.4000000000001s)]
*  And so the Celtics achieved their goal. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=774.0400000000001s)]
*  They protected home court. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=776.2s)]
*  Chalamet wasn't pointing at Knicks fans after the game. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=777.48s)]
*  And now there's pressure on the Knicks who still have a better team. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=780.48s)]
*  But at least now there's some pressure pushed the other way with that game [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=785.48s)]
*  seven in Boston, a looming, right? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=788.6s)]
*  Oh, I mean, I think the Knicks will win the series, but if, if I, do you think [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=791.08s)]
*  I'm going to sit here and not be doubtful and terrified of game six with OG playing [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=794.64s)]
*  the way he did tonight and like, yeah, what's going on with him? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=798.96s)]
*  He's, he's been up and down. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=803.04s)]
*  There was the stretch when Brunson was hurt where bridges and OG were phenomenal. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=804.84s)]
*  And it just felt like it's like low key felt like Brit Brunson being out for that [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=811.48s)]
*  long was actually great for the Knicks because it gave bridges and OG this time [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=817.0s)]
*  to score 20 points, 25 points, 30 points and be a focus of the offense that would [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=822.8s)]
*  help them when they, you know, reacclimated to the Brunson environment. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=827.4799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=832.4799999999999s)]
*  But right now it just doesn't feel like it. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=832.7199999999999s)]
*  It doesn't. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=836.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, plus he was awesome in game one. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=837.4799999999999s)]
*  I thought he was the best player on the court. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=839.1999999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=841.56s)]
*  And then we haven't seen it the same way. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=842.9599999999999s)]
*  There was a couple of things. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=845.3599999999999s)]
*  I thought that Celtics were doing a couple of things a little bit differently [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=847.24s)]
*  defensively. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=850.0799999999999s)]
*  One is they just didn't, they were fine with Josh Hart taking threes until he made about [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=851.52s)]
*  five. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=856.16s)]
*  He made then, then, then they shifted their defense. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=856.92s)]
*  But initially it was like, we're good with that. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=860.0799999999999s)]
*  We're good with that. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=861.76s)]
*  They really seems like they studied the tape of bridges. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=862.9599999999999s)]
*  What did bridges end up with today? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=866.0s)]
*  He was nine points today is four for 14. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=867.28s)]
*  He's got that weird. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=870.92s)]
*  It's like the guy you play pickup with all the time where they have this one shot. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=872.16s)]
*  And then eventually you figured out and you're like, fuck, why didn't I figure that out? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=876.52s)]
*  Six months ago, he does this jump shot. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=879.64s)]
*  It's like a hop step, 45 degree angle delivery shot and white couldn't time it. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=881.96s)]
*  And then finally this game, they started like timing the jumper a little bit better. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=888.24s)]
*  What he does is whether he's moving to his right or left or he's squared up to the hoop, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=892.04s)]
*  he squares his shoulders to the hoop and he puts his hands up like he's throwing a [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=896.4s)]
*  soccer throw in pass. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=900.96s)]
*  So the ball and then he flicks his wrist to get it there. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=902.76s)]
*  That's why he doesn't shoot threes that well. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=905.36s)]
*  But he always bends back. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=907.08s)]
*  He would he would rather take a 10 foot shot than an eight foot shot from the same [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=908.92s)]
*  place where his feet are at. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=912.56s)]
*  He's always going backwards. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=914.04s)]
*  And I think it was screwing up white. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=915.24s)]
*  He couldn't gauge it. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=916.68s)]
*  If you're over 43, he shoots like a double dribble character. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=917.56s)]
*  Like the ball goes up and his arms go up and then he releases the ball with his wrist [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=922.36s)]
*  only. And once you figure that out, I don't think anyone can figure it out. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=926.36s)]
*  I mean, I was with you. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=931.84s)]
*  I think I thought that he played so well in the fourth quarter of game four that [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=932.4399999999999s)]
*  they were just they were more wary of it. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=936.2s)]
*  It didn't seem like they were surprised by his offense in this game. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=938.04s)]
*  And then, you know, the other one was they were just really aggressive with Brunson [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=940.8s)]
*  and, you know, they just they fell asleep in game four. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=947.12s)]
*  Like the reason he got going in the third quarter of game four is because their [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=951.36s)]
*  defense suck. They fell asleep. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=954.12s)]
*  They weren't. They lost them a couple of times. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=955.8s)]
*  They just didn't do a good job. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=957.9599999999999s)]
*  They did a good job today. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=959.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it helped that he got six thousand ten minutes. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=960.68s)]
*  He didn't get going in game four. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=963.4s)]
*  Like he was absolutely on fire and took over the game. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=965.12s)]
*  I thought that game four was one of my favorite basketball games I've ever seen [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=968.2800000000001s)]
*  with Tatum and Brunson in the third quarter. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=971.5200000000001s)]
*  Just exchanging those punches was just one of my favorite basketball games I've [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=973.76s)]
*  ever seen. You know, I mean, I like basketball before, like the Knicks. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=976.64s)]
*  Like that was such a great game. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=978.6800000000001s)]
*  And it's too bad that Tatum was gone from it. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=980.5600000000001s)]
*  But here's a question I have for you. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=982.24s)]
*  There was a point in game two, I think, was the start of the second half [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=987.24s)]
*  when they just posted up towns on the left block and he got in like that [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=990.8000000000001s)]
*  Carmelo spot, like 10, 12 feet from the basket. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=993.8s)]
*  And they were just they were obviously doing it like they would throw it in, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=996.4399999999999s)]
*  throw it out. They were just they were obviously doing it. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=998.8s)]
*  And there's there's no Celtic defender that can cover him [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1000.68s)]
*  with his back to the basket, 13 feet from the basket. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1004.4799999999999s)]
*  And they just never go back to it. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1008.0799999999999s)]
*  I don't know. Isn't that the story of Towns' career, though? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1010.8399999999999s)]
*  It always seems like like the Celtics guarded him a true holiday a bunch of times [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1014.28s)]
*  today. And teams teams just feel like they can get away with it because [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1018.5999999999999s)]
*  Towns is more comfortable 25 feet from the basket. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1023.0s)]
*  But yeah, you're right. He torched Torford a couple of times in game to [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1026.08s)]
*  her for Towns, Brown Tatum. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1029.16s)]
*  It didn't. There's no one on the roster. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1030.56s)]
*  Maybe look, maybe this new look. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1032.56s)]
*  And right. Well, you know, it's interesting about him. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1034.4s)]
*  He's a streaky low post score. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1037.2s)]
*  You see people are streaky three point. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1039.84s)]
*  But he gets in like these grooves on the low post when you watch it. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1041.6s)]
*  You're like, how does he not average 40 a game? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1044.88s)]
*  And then he just won't shoot another eight footer for a month. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1048.16s)]
*  But it felt like a running back. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1051.32s)]
*  There's getting five yards of carry. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1052.4399999999998s)]
*  I think it was game two. I think I'm pretty sure it was the third quarter game [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1054.08s)]
*  to where this went to it like three plays in a row. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1056.8799999999999s)]
*  I said to myself, you just do this until they stop it. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1059.08s)]
*  Just do this until they stop it. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1061.52s)]
*  They never go back to it. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1063.0s)]
*  And like that. Why don't we see Brunson Towns pick and rolls? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1064.72s)]
*  Yeah, I'm looking at it. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1069.12s)]
*  I'm looking at his shot chart. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1069.9599999999998s)]
*  I mean, he didn't take that many shots, but he only took two threes. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1072.28s)]
*  He took a shot at the kids. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1075.0s)]
*  He can't stop fucking fouling Bill. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1076.08s)]
*  You can't look at his foul chart. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1078.12s)]
*  I'm telling you, all this five fouls had nothing to do with like [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1080.76s)]
*  affecting the play defensively. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1083.92s)]
*  Nothing to do with it. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1085.84s)]
*  Missoula did two things tonight [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1087.16s)]
*  that the Celtic fans have been calling for for a while. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1089.12s)]
*  One is he finally punted on Porzingis. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1091.92s)]
*  Listen, Porzingis, huge part of last year's team. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1094.8799999999999s)]
*  When he's healthy is a 20 point score. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1097.72s)]
*  He's unicorny. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1100.8799999999999s)]
*  I we can see it all. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1101.96s)]
*  He's corny. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1104.36s)]
*  Well, he's unicorny, too. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1105.6399999999999s)]
*  And in this series and in this whole playoffs [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1107.12s)]
*  and really since March, he's been he's been zombie Porzingis. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1109.88s)]
*  There's he's been porzombie. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1113.3200000000002s)]
*  There's no other way to put it. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1115.0800000000002s)]
*  And he's such a liability. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1116.1200000000001s)]
*  They're playing these two big lineups that they're just getting annihilated [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1117.5600000000002s)]
*  on in the previous games. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1120.5200000000002s)]
*  And then finally, they punted on it. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1122.8000000000002s)]
*  They started the second half with Cornett, which is what they should have done. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1124.4s)]
*  The irony of the Cornett piece, he's been a really good bench guy all year. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1127.4s)]
*  He's been good in the home games. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1131.5200000000002s)]
*  The crowd really likes him. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1132.88s)]
*  I'm just telling you, Cornett, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1135.72s)]
*  and they've played games, you know, they've been really careful [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1138.28s)]
*  because they kind of knew they were going to be the two seed for four months. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1141.2s)]
*  And they've been they would have games where they didn't play Tatum. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1145.52s)]
*  They would have games where they didn't play Brown. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1148.24s)]
*  And they had all these guys. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1150.6s)]
*  These guys are all used to playing without one of the two stars. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1151.96s)]
*  And Cornett was always like a big part of some of those games. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1155.0s)]
*  So I can't say I was like shocked that he played that way. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1157.6399999999999s)]
*  Seven blocks is shocking. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1160.44s)]
*  But I was waiting for him to play more for a couple of games now. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1161.8s)]
*  What what I love about Cornett is he's a very self aware basketball player. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1166.68s)]
*  He never tries to do anything outside of his skill set. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1172.3200000000002s)]
*  You'll never see him fucking dribble the ball. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1175.4s)]
*  You know, I mean, you'll never see him pull up for three, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1178.04s)]
*  even though he came up as like a 40 percent three point shooter. Right. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1179.8400000000001s)]
*  Like he's just never doing anything that's outside of his role and his skill set. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1182.76s)]
*  He just doesn't do it. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1188.0800000000002s)]
*  He's not going to make negative plays. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1189.44s)]
*  I'm not going to look it up, but I bet he has like four turnovers on the year. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1191.68s)]
*  I mean, he just he just does what he's supposed to do. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1196.0800000000002s)]
*  He knows his role. Well. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1198.3200000000002s)]
*  In this game, he helped with the rebounding, which was the other big thing that changed. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1201.8400000000001s)]
*  They just took the rebounding more seriously. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1205.48s)]
*  Robinson was really good again. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1207.4s)]
*  I have a theory. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1209.68s)]
*  Robinson, he's had stretches during his career. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1211.48s)]
*  Where you're like, why isn't this guy the next Bill Russell? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1216.0s)]
*  Why is it? Why aren't we talking about him? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1219.8000000000002s)]
*  Like we talk about Russell Chamberlain and Kareem. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1221.92s)]
*  You'll catch him for four minutes and like, is this the best part of the NBA? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1224.32s)]
*  Well, I watch a lot of Mitch Robinson. I'm not a huge fan. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1228.4399999999998s)]
*  He can't catch number one. He cannot catch the ball. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1231.1999999999998s)]
*  Number two, I will send you a link. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1233.76s)]
*  There's a video of him playing like pick up against like regular humans. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1235.28s)]
*  He looks like Kevin Durant, but taller and stronger. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1238.6399999999999s)]
*  And I have a theory about Robinson. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1242.3999999999999s)]
*  One of my favorite movies is The Prestige, right? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1245.4399999999998s)]
*  You know, the big act at the end where they're like, how? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1247.4799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Like, how do you how do you do this? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1249.7199999999998s)]
*  Well, I've got like a drunken twin brother. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1252.3999999999999s)]
*  There is another Mitch Robinson. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1254.6399999999999s)]
*  They prestige on the two Mitch Robinson's. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1256.3999999999999s)]
*  Who else? He was six for six, dude. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1259.36s)]
*  Like he could even hit the net. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1262.24s)]
*  He could even hit the net. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1265.1599999999999s)]
*  And they were all free throws that he was making the same way [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1265.7199999999998s)]
*  where they would hit the front of the rim, bounce over and go in like he was at a carnival. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1268.28s)]
*  He prestige. They prestige. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1272.04s)]
*  Miss Robinson tonight, there are two twin. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1274.12s)]
*  Can't rule it out. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1277.1599999999999s)]
*  I mean, I've never seen. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1278.36s)]
*  I've never seen. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1280.64s)]
*  I've only seen one Mitch Robinson at a time. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1281.68s)]
*  I'm still trying to figure out how shallow they got courtside. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1283.6000000000001s)]
*  I have I have more stuff to talk about this game, but we got to take a quick break. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1287.5200000000002s)]
*  Hey, as you know, I like to create things. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1292.5600000000002s)]
*  We worked with Fando on a new betting concept we call tail or fade. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1294.5200000000002s)]
*  We've done it for a couple of weeks in a row. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1300.72s)]
*  We hit last week. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1302.44s)]
*  I make a player prop pick. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1303.72s)]
*  You either get to decide to back it, which is a tail, or go against it, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1306.0400000000002s)]
*  which is a fade, but either way you get a 50% boost either on the over or the under. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1310.36s)]
*  So if you check out Fando sports book on Thursday for the OKC Denver game, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1315.72s)]
*  what we did was we did Yoke edge points, rebounds, I think over 40 and a half. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1321.36s)]
*  So if it's a combined thing gets to 41, you win the bet and you win your little [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1327.48s)]
*  50% profit boost on that bet. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1333.04s)]
*  I'm going over on my guy. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1336.68s)]

*  If you want to tell me, join me. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1339.72s)]
*  If you want to go against me, fade me, whatever you want to do. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1341.6000000000001s)]
*  I love when the customers ride with me. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1345.16s)]
*  They won last week, by the way. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1346.64s)]
*  Can't wait to make fun of those who fade me and lose. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1348.16s)]
*  So for for Thursday, Yoke itch, 40 and a half over. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1351.48s)]

*  just shut down and they didn't say anything. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1447.36s)]

*  a surgery and they just didn't want to say anything until they found out it was [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1452.6399999999999s)]

*  Um, but he was really good tonight. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1542.3999999999999s)]
*  And to me, that's the reason not to trade him because I still feel like he's one [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1545.56s)]
*  of the 20 best guys in the league. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1553.76s)]
*  What he did tonight is the case for like, don't blow it up. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1555.8s)]
*  Maybe Tatum can be back in February. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1558.9599999999998s)]
*  Maybe you only have to shave around the salary sides. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1560.72s)]
*  Maybe you're a five, six, seven seed. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1563.72s)]
*  Maybe Tatum rounds in the shape until April. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1565.76s)]
*  Maybe Jaylen Brown can hold this fort with the infrastructure, Missoula. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1568.28s)]
*  And the fact that the East is going to suck. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1572.6799999999998s)]
*  You know, I, to me that this game is going to make me think of that this summer. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1575.48s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1579.3999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1580.12s)]
*  I made a lot on you there. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1581.6399999999999s)]
*  Sorry, but four minute, four minute first take intro. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1582.8s)]
*  First of all, people, the people that are listening to the Bill Simmons [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1586.1599999999999s)]
*  podcast want to hear that. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1589.6s)]
*  And I'm honored to be here to respond to it. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1591.12s)]
*  And I will say that I also am prepared to ask you these questions. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1593.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1598.0s)]
*  I never really considered the Jaylen Brown trade. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1598.24s)]
*  I think you're too much in the weeds. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1601.52s)]
*  I think the questions that need to be asked are is Horford gone? [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1603.28s)]
*  Is Porzingis gone? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1607.6s)]
*  Is White gone? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1608.4399999999998s)]
*  Is Drew Holliday gone? [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1609.32s)]
*  Like those four players are not going to be- [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1611.28s)]
*  White's the only one who doesn't go. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1613.2s)]
*  Wait, because White's contract is- [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1614.52s)]
*  Are you sure? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1615.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1616.6s)]
*  For what his, for what his value is and his age and all the stuff he brings to [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1616.84s)]
*  the table, I think he's one of the 40 best guys in the league. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1621.4s)]
*  If you're making a list, like when I do Ringer 100, he's always in the 40 to 45 [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1624.5600000000002s)]
*  range for what he's making money wise. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1628.1200000000001s)]
*  You have to keep him. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1632.1200000000001s)]
*  Holiday is a little different. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1633.76s)]
*  Is contract taken into account when you take, you need to make that list. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1634.8400000000001s)]
*  Is contract taken into account? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1637.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1638.0800000000002s)]
*  His, his, he's under 30 million still. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1638.2s)]
*  So here's my, here's my take on like the future of the Celtics is I think that [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1640.3600000000001s)]
*  Porzingis is gone, Holliday's gone. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1644.68s)]
*  Yeah, but Porzingis, they still have to get a contract back. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1647.0800000000002s)]
*  It's not like they could just be like, here, take his contract. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1650.2s)]
*  Well, but you still have to get some sort of money back. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1653.6000000000001s)]
*  You're not just wiping the slate. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1655.8s)]
*  You're getting, you're taking back like Rui Hachamora or whoever it is. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1657.28s)]
*  The PR people for the Celtics need to put out some sort of like, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1660.8s)]
*  Porzingis has this thing that's going to heal in two months and his [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1663.6000000000001s)]
*  trade value is going to go up. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1666.6000000000001s)]
*  But I will say this. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1667.6000000000001s)]
*  I think it's a Peyton Pritchard play. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1668.56s)]
*  I really think it's like, it's, it's Pritchard is going to bridge this gap of [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1670.8s)]
*  scoring and playmaking and things that we lose with Tatum. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1677.36s)]
*  He's that good. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1680.9599999999998s)]
*  Like I think next year becomes like a Brown Pritchard. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1683.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's going to be tough. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1689.28s)]
*  17 points at 30 10 minutes. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1692.4799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, he's good, but they could patch it together with the infrastructure [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1694.4399999999998s)]
*  because this team plays really well together and they have a certain style [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1698.36s)]
*  slash system, you know, but I want to ask you, here's a question. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1702.08s)]
*  I want to ask you that people want to hear what do the Celtics look like next season? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1705.64s)]
*  I think either poor, poor for depending on if he wants to chase the title or [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1710.5600000000002s)]
*  just stay in Boston, um, one of the most beloved Celtics teammates slash veterans [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1715.3600000000001s)]
*  they've ever had in the history of the franchise. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1721.72s)]
*  I'd be surprised if he was like, all right, I'll see you guys later. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1723.88s)]
*  I'm going to play for Orlando. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1726.3600000000001s)]
*  I guess he's going to be 40 next year. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1728.24s)]
*  I don't, you know, you don't want to start just chasing stuff. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1729.76s)]
*  He already won the title last year. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1732.64s)]
*  It's not like he needs a ring. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1733.8400000000001s)]
*  Um, but I think it's probably poor Zingas or drew that would be, um, that those [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1735.8000000000002s)]
*  would be, it would be one of those two and drew probably has a little more value [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1741.96s)]
*  based on what's happened to poor Zingas at this point. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1744.76s)]
*  Now his contract's not great. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1747.16s)]
*  He's got three years left after this, but, um, the type of guy, the winning guy. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1748.48s)]
*  Well, you try to do it. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1754.0s)]
*  So you're trying to get somebody with less money that you're shaving. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1755.1200000000001s)]
*  You know, if they shaved $7 million off in a trade, it turns out it's like [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1760.64s)]
*  $70 million with all this repeater tax, all this. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1764.2s)]
*  So that's, I think what they would be trying to do. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1768.1200000000001s)]
*  There's like bigger trades. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1770.88s)]
*  If you wanted to go nuts, where it'd be like Jalen Brown and drew [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1772.0800000000002s)]
*  holiday to Houston and you get a bunch of stuff back, but you're taking [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1775.44s)]
*  $20 million less in salary and you're basically rebuilding while also [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1779.32s)]
*  I know, but that's, that's why that stuff's not going to happen. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1785.16s)]
*  I'm just saying like the big monster, if you were playing this as a video [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1787.76s)]
*  game and it wasn't human beings and real people, he'd be like, Oh, I'll just [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1792.2s)]
*  do this and I'll just build the round table, but they're not doing that. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1795.76s)]
*  Especially the new owner. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1800.44s)]
*  He's not going to want to come in and, and, uh, I blow stuff up to save money. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1801.48s)]
*  True holiday, 80 cents on the dollar. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1807.04s)]
*  Poor Zingas, 25 cents in the dollar. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1808.92s)]
*  Or it might, it might even be as simple as Sam Hauser gets traded this summer [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1811.24s)]
*  because a lot of teams could use a really good three point shooting. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1816.48s)]
*  He's not making it. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1819.4s)]
*  Shooters not making a ton of money. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1820.16s)]
*  And then you figure out in February where you are and whether you want to [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1821.9599999999998s)]
*  shave salary or not, because poor Zingas would be an expiring at that point. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1825.52s)]
*  But I can't, I just can't believe we're having this conversation. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1828.32s)]
*  It was inconceivable a week ago. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1831.56s)]
*  It sucks. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1833.32s)]
*  I mean, but, but they're going to win a lot of games in the Eastern [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1833.9199999999998s)]
*  conference with no Tatum. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1836.3999999999999s)]
*  Jaylen had 26 points, 12 assists and eight rebounds. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1839.04s)]
*  And my fear for the game today was he can't dribble. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1842.6799999999998s)]
*  Um, and I just, I just thought the next would be like smothering him and [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1847.24s)]
*  be like, this guy can't dribble, let's go get him. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1851.2s)]
*  But he was pretty comfortable running the offense. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1853.48s)]
*  And, um, and I thought, I just thought he did a good job. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1855.76s)]
*  I thought he was patient. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1859.32s)]
*  He only took 17 shots. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1860.16s)]
*  My fear was he was going to take like 30, but he didn't. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1861.8s)]
*  And they were pretty democratic, as you said, with the, uh, with the ball. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1864.68s)]
*  So, you know, it's the question is, was this a moral victory or something more? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1868.8s)]
*  Did they figure out something in this game that they can take? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1873.88s)]
*  So they figured out the piece. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1876.48s)]
*  Well, they figured out Bob movement, the coordinate piece and just continue [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1878.68s)]
*  to hope towns is a complete idiot. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1882.16s)]
*  And towns can't stop fouling people. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1886.3600000000001s)]
*  That's what they figured out. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1888.0800000000002s)]
*  Like, but you and I figured out, could him play in the series two games ago. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1888.96s)]
*  Two games ago. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1894.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, has he had a good playoff game? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1896.3600000000001s)]
*  What's no, he isn't the only time he's been good. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1900.52s)]
*  There's been some decent defensive stuff where he's just had his arms up. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1903.92s)]
*  But you mean the seven foot three guy put his arms in the air and that was good. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1908.6000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1912.16s)]
*  But that, did I expect him to turn into taco fall? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1912.8s)]
*  I didn't, I didn't realize that was going to be his new role in this team. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1915.4s)]
*  He's taco winter, dude. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1919.2s)]
*  He's taco winter. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1920.56s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1924.28s)]
*  This Jalen Brown piece though. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1927.48s)]
*  There's no way, right? [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1930.8400000000001s)]
*  Cause I want Tatum and Brown to retire together. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1932.16s)]
*  I don't want them to trade Jalen Brown. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1934.4s)]
*  No. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1936.8400000000001s)]
*  And yet around the league, people are like, watch Jalen is going to be the one who goes. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1937.08s)]
*  It's they're going to blow it up. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1940.8s)]
*  And I just, I don't see it. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1941.8799999999999s)]
*  That's not people around the league. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1942.96s)]
*  That's people like us that talking to microphones. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1943.9199999999998s)]
*  It's just like fun to say, but why would they trade Jalen Brown? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1945.56s)]
*  Jalen Brown is going to be the engine that brings the train to the next station, to the [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1948.08s)]
*  next station, to the next station next year. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1952.48s)]
*  And there's 82 stops. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1954.6799999999998s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1956.12s)]
*  Like he is the engine of the train. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1956.6399999999999s)]
*  He's going to drive it and sometimes it's going to be ugly. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1958.12s)]
*  And sometimes it's going to look great. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1960.52s)]
*  But like, if you trade Jalen Brown, who do you get back? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1961.6399999999999s)]
*  It's going to be like your go to guy. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1965.4s)]
*  It's going to be better than him. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1968.88s)]
*  That's good. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1970.16s)]
*  This like, I don't know. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1970.52s)]
*  No. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1972.52s)]
*  And he's on the same timeline as Tatum. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1973.0400000000002s)]
*  And you won a championship 11 months ago. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1974.5600000000002s)]
*  They won the championship. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1977.4s)]
*  There's a parade, you know, 50 weeks ago. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1978.52s)]
*  Can I, can I talk about Tatum's first eight seasons with you for a split second? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1983.52s)]
*  Cause I continue to think he's incredibly underrated and it sadly took a major, major [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1987.5600000000002s)]
*  injury for people to go, Oh man, that guy was really good. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1993.84s)]
*  This is too bad. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1996.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1997.84s)]
*  I don't think anyone took more shit unnecessarily. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=1998.0s)]
*  All he did was get better every year and really give a shit. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2001.56s)]
*  As long as you allow me to retort with how corny he is when you're done. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2005.12s)]
*  Go. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2008.1999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2008.72s)]
*  There's been nine guys since the merger season who in their first eight [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2010.84s)]
*  seasons played over 20,000 minutes and scored 13,000 points or more than 3000 [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2015.24s)]
*  rebounds or more in 2000 assists or more. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2021.8s)]
*  MJ LeBron, bird, Barkley, KD, heart and Pierce Tatum and Mark Aguirre. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2024.0s)]
*  Weirdly. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2028.1599999999999s)]
*  There's been 14 guys ever in their first eight seasons who played [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2030.0s)]
*  a hundred plus playoff games and scored at least 15 points a game in those games. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2033.9599999999998s)]
*  Bird Tatum, Duncan, Kobe, worthy Kawhi, Jalen magic, Parker, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2038.9599999999998s)]
*  McHale, Pippen, Manu and Scott and Byron Scott. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2042.72s)]
*  And there's been a hundred guys. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2046.08s)]
*  There's been four guys who have played a hundred playoff games in their first [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2047.36s)]
*  eight years and had 28 and four as their stats, 20 points, game eight, rebounds, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2051.2s)]
*  forces, LeBron, will bird Elgin and Tatum. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2055.04s)]
*  What was so interesting about his career from a historical standpoint was how [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2060.04s)]
*  much postseason mileage and success that he had and he has 72 playoff wins. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2063.7999999999997s)]
*  He's just turned 27. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2069.2799999999997s)]
*  It's so like Jordan didn't have nearly that many playoff wins by the time he [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2071.3199999999997s)]
*  was 27, like even, you know, LeBron didn't have a hundred wins by the time he was [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2075.16s)]
*  27. So he was amassing this career that one of the best things about it was the [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2079.48s)]
*  durability and the fact that year after year he was playing into May and June [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2084.68s)]
*  potentially, and he was on a really good team in a good spot. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2089.4s)]
*  And he was, I think one of the three most durable guys of this century, him and [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2093.16s)]
*  Yannis and LeBron where it almost seemed like an accident if they even like [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2097.32s)]
*  sprained their ankle. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2101.44s)]
*  Him and LeBron, him and LeBron taking Yannis out of that. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2102.52s)]
*  Well, be honest, he had one where he like fell and like broke bone in his back. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2105.88s)]
*  And, you know, but for the most part. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2109.84s)]
*  Playoff availability. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2112.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2114.08s)]
*  I know what you mean. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2114.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2115.32s)]
*  And in a minute that's all gone. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2117.12s)]
*  But I just, I just thought that first eight years he had was really crazy. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2118.56s)]
*  I never thought about it until that injury. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2122.12s)]
*  I will also say to be nice about Tatum, different running mates throughout the [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2124.7599999999998s)]
*  runs, right? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2129.56s)]
*  There's like the Isaiah Thomas season. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2130.88s)]
*  You know, there's a scary Terry season. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2133.0s)]
*  It's just like a lot of different elements that he's always been the constant [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2134.8399999999997s)]
*  variable in the equation where everything else sort of changed. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2138.72s)]
*  And he still had this consistent output. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2141.6s)]
*  Another thing I'll say, but nice about Tatum, not a lot of duds, you know, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2144.68s)]
*  I mean, he's like a lot of these star players. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2148.6s)]
*  There's a couple of duds out there. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2150.04s)]
*  You're like, Oh yeah, like remember game two of the second round series. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2151.2s)]
*  We was like, went four for 25. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2153.72s)]
*  Like, like he doesn't have those games. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2155.8399999999997s)]
*  He has ups and downs, but he doesn't have like dud, dud games. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2157.56s)]
*  And it'll always bring defense and rebounding and he'll help the game in [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2160.0s)]
*  other ways, even if the shot isn't going. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2163.76s)]
*  And the thing as a non former Celtics fan, I will say I loved Larry Bird growing [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2166.5200000000004s)]
*  up. And here's a question to have for you is why can't I like connect to him as a [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2171.0800000000004s)]
*  person? Like, why do I think he's corny? [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2176.1200000000003s)]
*  Why do I think that he's inauthentic? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2178.96s)]
*  Like I was reminded by co-host of the mismatch, Verno, when they won last year, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2181.0800000000004s)]
*  there was that like clip together of him sort of like cosplaying all these other [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2185.96s)]
*  Kobe moments and like Kevin Garnett moments. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2189.7200000000003s)]
*  Like, like why don't I connect to him as a person? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2192.36s)]
*  I know nothing about his personality, other than the sides from the fact that he [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2195.76s)]
*  has a son named Deuce. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2199.0400000000004s)]
*  Like, why do I think that he's corny and inauthentic? [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2200.28s)]
*  I'm asking you that question, not because I'm trying to accuse him of something or [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2202.5600000000004s)]
*  insult him. I just want you to put me on the couch and tell me why I feel that [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2205.28s)]
*  way. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2208.4s)]
*  Well, so I would argue the Celtic fans feel the opposite. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2209.44s)]
*  Like he's a beloved Celtic. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2212.88s)]
*  And I think the reason he's beloved is because all he does is like work his ass [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2214.8s)]
*  off, try to get better, be a good example. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2220.28s)]
*  Doesn't, doesn't ever say anything controversial, doesn't ever get in any [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2223.92s)]
*  kind of trouble, obviously. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2228.2400000000002s)]
*  And all he is is just additive in all of these different ways. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2229.4s)]
*  And I think when you watch it day in and day out, that's what you notice when [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2232.48s)]
*  you're a fan of the team. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2235.8s)]
*  I think if you're not a fan of the team and you're judging people by, are they [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2237.1600000000003s)]
*  interesting? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2241.1600000000003s)]
*  Are they up and down? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2241.96s)]
*  Can I have conversations about them? [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2242.96s)]
*  There's just not a lot of Tatum conversations, but like, he's not as nearly [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2245.1200000000003s)]
*  as good as Tim Duncan, who's one of the, I have him as the seventh best player [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2249.44s)]
*  ever, but Tim Duncan used to take a lot of the same shit. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2252.44s)]
*  He wasn't as interesting as Kobe. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2256.08s)]
*  Remember he wasn't as fun to watch as Steve Nash. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2258.16s)]
*  He wasn't, he didn't care as much as KG. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2261.68s)]
*  He wasn't as vocal. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2264.12s)]
*  And there were always, every time he got compared to anybody, even now, all these [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2265.28s)]
*  ex player podcasts, they always shit on Duncan or they, you know, go out of their [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2269.6s)]
*  way to talk about, Oh no, Kobe was better. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2273.6s)]
*  Kobe was way better. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2275.64s)]
*  You know, but I just think some guys do that. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2277.3599999999997s)]
*  You don't think? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2280.3199999999997s)]
*  No, I think it's, I think it's, it kind of goes into like the ex player pods where [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2281.68s)]
*  it's like, he's really good at basketball. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2286.7999999999997s)]
*  Maybe he's not the best in the press conference. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2289.48s)]
*  Maybe he's not going to make you laugh. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2291.2s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2292.68s)]
*  Like maybe he's not Peyton Manning is going to host SNL, but like we, that's not [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2293.2799999999997s)]
*  why we love him. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2297.3599999999997s)]
*  We love him because he's a basketball player. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2298.04s)]
*  So why do we knock him for not being a great personality? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2299.7999999999997s)]
*  Did you think LeBron was like the most personable guy on the planet? [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2303.3999999999996s)]
*  The first eight, nine years of his career. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2306.48s)]
*  This was even a knock on him during that time. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2308.16s)]
*  Where people are like, I don't know what the personality is. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2310.48s)]
*  I could turn a 17 hour podcast about LeBron's personality. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2313.4s)]
*  I don't even, I don't even know where to start and end with that. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2316.16s)]
*  Nobody could get a handle on him for the first, almost, and really until like the [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2318.76s)]
*  second or third Miami years. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2323.64s)]
*  I don't, I don't know who LeBron James is, dude. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2326.0s)]
*  I don't even want to start down that path. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2328.88s)]
*  I don't want to start down that path. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2330.96s)]
*  But we always had like KG, Anthony Edwards. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2332.36s)]
*  Those are the kind of players that people seem to gravitate to. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2334.76s)]
*  They're like Anthony Edwards is a best example. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2337.48s)]
*  Yeah, like all of that. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2339.88s)]
*  And they're fucking awesome. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2342.2000000000003s)]
*  And you want to hang out with them and they make you laugh. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2343.84s)]
*  And they're just, you're like, they're cool. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2345.76s)]
*  They like, they sit at the lunch table that you are not allowed to sit at. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2347.0s)]
*  That's where I like my professional athletes. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2351.0400000000004s)]
*  I want my professional athletes to be at the table in the cafeteria that I'm [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2353.0s)]
*  scared to look at and I'm never allowed to sit at. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2357.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2360.28s)]
*  And I feel like Tatum's not there and I'm not knocking him for it. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2361.0400000000004s)]
*  I'm just talking about it. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2364.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2365.4399999999996s)]
*  Well, it's not the first time I've heard that. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2366.08s)]
*  I think my argument for Tatum is he doesn't try to be anything he's not. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2367.8799999999997s)]
*  You know, he's not trying, he doesn't want to host SNL and he doesn't want [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2372.3199999999997s)]
*  to be in an Adam Sandler movie. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2375.72s)]
*  He doesn't want to do any of that stuff. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2376.9199999999996s)]
*  He just wants to. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2378.12s)]
*  25 and 10 and six. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2378.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2380.4399999999996s)]
*  So that's what I'm going to do. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2380.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2381.64s)]
*  No, I'm going to do that too. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2381.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean, one of the things, some of the, some of the like little stealth [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2382.3199999999997s)]
*  combos I've had are just people worried about removing basketball from his life. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2385.8799999999997s)]
*  How's he going to handle the next four or five months? [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2390.9199999999996s)]
*  He's never had a major injury. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2393.04s)]
*  He's been hooping basically since he was growing up in St. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2394.68s)]
*  Louis, everything is about like trying to get better, trying to get better, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2396.92s)]
*  trying to catch people, trying to hit different levels and trying to be one [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2400.44s)]
*  of the 10 best players in the league, trying to be one of the best five, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2404.88s)]
*  trying to win a title. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2407.36s)]
*  Can I be the best player in the league? [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2408.56s)]
*  And not only is that chase over, but your body has been like really [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2410.56s)]
*  injured for the first time. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2413.72s)]
*  How are you going to handle that? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2414.96s)]
*  You know, and I think the good thing for him is Kobe was his idol, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2416.56s)]
*  which you mentioned before, but Kobe had the exact same injury. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2419.8s)]
*  And really documented what it was like to have that injury and how he fought back [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2423.2s)]
*  from it and how he, you know, the work starts now, how great do you want to be? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2428.48s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2432.84s)]
*  He, he weirdly laid like the Bible for how to attack something like [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2433.36s)]
*  this for somebody like Tatum. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2436.48s)]
*  There's two pieces of information that we got today that I found really telling. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2438.28s)]
*  And I found kind of like brought me into the Tatum psyche and circle, which I loved. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2441.44s)]
*  One was Marcus Spears, not my favorite Marcus Spears, Swagoo. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2447.36s)]
*  I love the other Marcus Spears, but I love the football Marcus Spears. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2451.36s)]
*  So, so, so, so, yes, the basketball one. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2453.88s)]
*  He said that he spoke with Tatum's father who was a coaching in Malaysia or whatever. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2457.2400000000002s)]
*  And he, and he was allowed to talk about his conversation with his father, about [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2462.0800000000004s)]
*  his conversation with Jason and his father said to Jason Tatum, he said, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2465.28s)]
*  your idol is Kobe Bryant. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2469.84s)]
*  Your idol is Kobe Bryant. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2472.92s)]
*  That's the path you wanted to go down. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2474.4s)]
*  And this is part of the path. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2476.36s)]
*  And that's not a direct quote, but I found that to be like, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2477.5600000000004s)]
*  as a father, you know, I thought that was like a really cool thing to say. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2481.32s)]
*  And I'm really glad that Spears got that information to share with us. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2485.48s)]
*  And another thing, I don't know if you heard this part of the broadcast is Reggie [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2488.48s)]
*  said he texted with Tatum and he sort of like read the text on the broadcast. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2490.6800000000003s)]
*  And I was sitting there, I felt it was like, I felt like a violation of trust. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2496.4s)]
*  But obviously Reggie texted him and Tatum sort of sent this message to Celtus fans. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2500.0s)]
*  And it was while they were like up by 20, the end of the third quarter. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2505.2000000000003s)]
*  And he was like, and I can't, I can't, can't paraphrase. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2508.2000000000003s)]
*  I just watched it, you know, 40 minutes ago. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2510.8799999999997s)]
*  But he's like Jason Tate said he can't wait to get back into the Celtic green [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2513.08s)]
*  and he's going to show the fans how much that means to him. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2518.48s)]
*  And as someone who sat on a pretty popular podcast [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2522.12s)]
*  10 minutes ago and was like, I don't understand this guy, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2525.24s)]
*  don't get his personality and try to critique him in that way. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2527.12s)]
*  Those two pieces of information getting into my brain was so fucking cool. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2529.3999999999996s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2534.3599999999997s)]
*  Like the idea that like his dad gave him [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2535.2799999999997s)]
*  this guidance when he said probably the worst day of his life and that he texted [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2537.4s)]
*  Reggie knowing it's going to get read on the broadcast in front of millions of [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2543.1600000000003s)]
*  people, that this message to Celtic fans about his appreciation of his position [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2546.0s)]
*  in the sport, I thought that was a really cool thing to hear today when there's [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2550.92s)]
*  been so much information about how long the injury is going to take and what's [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2554.6400000000003s)]
*  going to be like when he comes back and what Celtics do with the roster. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2558.0s)]
*  Like hearing that from him, I found touch. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2560.76s)]
*  Well, he's one of those guys within the organization, absolutely beloved. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2563.7599999999998s)]
*  Just, you know, you have a lot of different people over the years who could be the [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2570.32s)]
*  face of a franchise and he's really embraced it, has embraced the relationships [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2573.72s)]
*  with the guys who used to be on the team, the former stars and just kind of gets it, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2577.88s)]
*  gets, you know, he came in when he was 19 and just kind of gets that this is a [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2582.68s)]
*  slightly different franchise than the usual franchise that has a lot of history [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2588.72s)]
*  and, you know, a lot of baggage, good and bad. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2592.52s)]
*  But it's, it's the bummer for this is it took him getting injured, I think, for [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2597.28s)]
*  people to appreciate, you know, people, especially in this day and age, you're [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2601.08s)]
*  picking apart, you're picking apart. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2605.72s)]
*  This guy doesn't do this. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2607.12s)]
*  This guy does this. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2608.04s)]
*  You know, you know what it is? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2608.88s)]
*  He was the fourth best guy in the league and he was still getting better and he [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2609.7599999999998s)]
*  was playing probably the best all around game of his career in the game that he [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2614.2s)]
*  got hurt and there was still room for him to get better and better. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2617.44s)]
*  Now who knows if he hit that limit or not. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2620.0s)]
*  Durant came back and I felt like he was just about where he left in that 21 [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2624.12s)]
*  playoffs against Milwaukee, right? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2628.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2631.2400000000002s)]
*  But like scoring wise, it felt like he came back. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2631.44s)]
*  So that would be the hope. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2633.96s)]
*  And it seems like they caught it pretty early, but man, I was thinking it has to [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2635.0s)]
*  be one of the worst NBA injuries from, from, uh, hitting a guy at a certain point [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2641.32s)]
*  of his career and also what it meant to like a team, like Bill Walton hurting his [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2647.12s)]
*  foot, that probably changed the course of a couple of titles. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2650.68s)]
*  It's been a couple of these Derek Rose, Derek Rose is one where it felt like [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2653.68s)]
*  that was the team that was positioned to battle LeBron for the 2010s and then [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2658.2s)]
*  he's just gone. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2662.8399999999997s)]
*  So we've had these Sampson and 86 when he fell and hurt his back. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2664.44s)]
*  He was never really the same after that. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2668.52s)]
*  There's been a few of these, but it's hard to remember like a first team [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2670.3599999999997s)]
*  on NBA guy just getting wiped out for not just the playoffs. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2674.0s)]
*  Brendan Moriah, he wasn't as good as Tatum though. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2679.6s)]
*  You know, like Tatum's been first team on NBA four years in a row. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2681.88s)]

*  to this podcast, they care about Bill Simmons. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2752.24s)]
*  You know, it's the podcast. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2754.04s)]
*  Like what have you been doing the last 48 hours? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2755.68s)]
*  Oh, yesterday was brutal. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2757.64s)]
*  Um, what happened? [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2758.96s)]
*  Take me through it. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2760.2s)]
*  I was just farting around all day. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2761.36s)]
*  I did a power walk. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2764.32s)]
*  I was on Twitter. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2765.32s)]
*  I was just basically refreshing Twitter, waiting for the word and checking my [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2765.96s)]
*  texts. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2769.32s)]
*  Um, now when you get older as a sports fan, it starts reminding you of things [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2770.44s)]
*  that happened. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2774.96s)]
*  So the obvious one was the Brady ACL. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2775.48s)]
*  That's the only other time I remember. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2778.2799999999997s)]
*  And then when Kim Neely got hurt in the Pittsburgh series and then when I was in [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2780.7599999999998s)]
*  college, that was another one. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2784.6s)]
*  But, um, but at that point we didn't know he was going to, it was going to [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2785.84s)]
*  change his career. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2789.68s)]
*  Like intrusive thought that you had. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2790.44s)]
*  Well, I think the Brady one was the worst one. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2793.12s)]
*  Cause that was one you just start thinking in terms of, all right, this is [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2795.28s)]
*  how long it's actually going to be versus when you're younger and it's like, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2800.76s)]
*  Oh, it could be back in February. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2803.8s)]
*  He'll be fine. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2805.16s)]
*  But you're like, now this is actually probably two years and the whole team [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2806.0s)]
*  might be different and maybe they missed their window. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2810.64s)]
*  And then you start thinking about windows. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2812.7200000000003s)]
*  Like, was there ever a part of you that was like, maybe next year it doesn't help [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2814.12s)]
*  us to win basketball games. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2818.12s)]
*  Oh, I definitely had that thought. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2820.24s)]
*  I don't know how you don't, especially with the financial stuff and the money. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2822.3599999999997s)]
*  And they're so good. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2825.7999999999997s)]
*  I know. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2827.12s)]
*  Well, then you start thinking of the window of like from 22, 23, 24, 25. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2827.7999999999997s)]
*  They make the finals in 22 and Curry just goes to another level and they're [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2834.2799999999997s)]
*  not ready yet. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2838.96s)]
*  They lose 23. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2839.56s)]
*  They get to the game seven and gets Miami. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2841.4s)]
*  I'll still, I'll always wonder what would happen if Tatum doesn't sprain his [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2844.04s)]
*  ankle in the first 40 seconds of the game? [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2847.24s)]
*  Cause I still feel like I just thought he was going to be awesome that game 24. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2849.4399999999996s)]
*  They win this year. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2853.8799999999997s)]
*  Cleveland gets bounced. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2855.6s)]
*  They have a chance. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2857.08s)]
*  Like, you know, but here's the other thing. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2857.8799999999997s)]
*  The Knicks were about to go up three, one in that series with Tatum. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2860.6s)]
*  Like the Knicks, they're winning anyway. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2863.8799999999997s)]
*  Like as a Knicks fan, I kind of wish, I wish you never got hurt, but I feel like [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2865.3199999999997s)]
*  the Knicks win this series with Tatum not getting hurt. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2868.8799999999997s)]
*  And that's a whole hypothetical. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2871.64s)]
*  We don't have to go down, but one thing that I heard on this podcast from you, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2872.6s)]
*  they might've won the key game in the series before, during the, right before he got [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2875.72s)]
*  hurt. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2880.12s)]
*  It was already over there down. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2880.3999999999996s)]
*  That was, OG was getting that. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2881.64s)]
*  OG was getting that loose ball. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2883.8399999999997s)]
*  And he was going up nine. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2885.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2886.7999999999997s)]
*  It's like that. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2886.96s)]
*  And with Brunson, like, please, that's a, that's a win of three, one. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2887.48s)]
*  They're winning. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2890.64s)]
*  But, um, I was listening to this stupid podcast driving back from upstate. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2891.6s)]
*  Like it was a pandemic. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2895.96s)]
*  Might've been like, it's not the bubble. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2896.72s)]
*  Maybe it was the bubble of the year after the bubble. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2898.2s)]
*  And you were talking about the Celtics and just how like fickle the windows are. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2900.2799999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2904.44s)]
*  You were just talking about like, it was, I think it was, I think it was the, I [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2904.88s)]
*  can't remember if it was the bubble year or the year after the bubble, but you were [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2908.1600000000003s)]
*  talking during the playoffs around this time of year, just about like, Hey man, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2911.52s)]
*  with these windows, like you think you got a chance next year, but like you [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2914.6s)]
*  really don't like this, like sometimes the six month window, sometimes a two [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2918.04s)]
*  year window. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2921.48s)]
*  And I think that this injury and this moment is just a good example of that. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2922.32s)]
*  The Celtics are favorites to win the East, if not the championship, they're, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2928.56s)]
*  they're the what number two seed, but we all like secretly know that this is the [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2934.68s)]
*  best team in the Eastern conference. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2939.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2940.2s)]
*  And we're talking about repeat championships and then this happens. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2940.48s)]
*  And we're talking about, should they win games next year or tank for a pick? [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2944.2799999999997s)]
*  Like that's just how fragile these things are. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2947.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2952.8399999999997s)]
*  I remember writing about it. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2953.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2955.04s)]
*  See, make the finals in 12. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2955.3999999999996s)]
*  They do the hard end trade. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2958.3999999999996s)]
*  Westbrook gets injured in 13 in 14 San Antonio beats. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2960.3599999999997s)]
*  And then all of a sudden they get to the clay Thompson game. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2965.64s)]
*  Clay gets catches fire. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2968.8799999999997s)]
*  They lose that in seven. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2970.64s)]
*  And they had this stretch of like, Oh, that team's going to be in the finals [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2971.7999999999997s)]
*  the whole decade and they won one finals game the entire, like the over under was [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2974.8399999999997s)]
*  probably 10 finals games. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2979.92s)]
*  They won one. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2981.72s)]
*  At least, at least there was a clay Thompson game as a Knicks fan. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2982.68s)]
*  I'm gonna look back and be like, and then Luke Cornett came in for [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2985.6s)]
*  a gate beat to start the second half. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2988.64s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2990.56s)]
*  He blocked seven shots and we couldn't stop him. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2991.04s)]
*  He's got an alley oop. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2993.44s)]
*  It was fucking Nick. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2994.92s)]
*  And then the series slipped. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2995.72s)]
*  That's fucking yeah. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2996.2s)]
*  And then I feel like it was Luke Cornett. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2996.7999999999997s)]
*  But that's the thing. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2999.12s)]
*  You talk about windows. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=2999.7999999999997s)]
*  I would say this is the window for the Knicks is almost more dramatic. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3001.4s)]
*  They, the Celtics get nudged out of this potentially. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3005.44s)]
*  Cleveland's out. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3008.68s)]
*  You have Indiana now and I think you have home court, right? [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3010.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3013.4s)]
*  What do you think, dude? [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3013.7999999999997s)]
*  Um, and then you just think like, all right, okay. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3015.48s)]
*  See, not afraid of them. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3018.2400000000002s)]
*  Young team Brunson versus SGA head to head. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3021.28s)]
*  We could take that or whether it's Minnesota, but yeah, I mean, the [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3024.4s)]
*  Knicks have never had a window that looked as good as this, even in 99. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3028.44s)]
*  They, they had no chance in that Spurs series. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3033.1600000000003s)]
*  You know, they weren't ever, it's not heat series. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3036.6000000000004s)]
*  They won it. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3041.0800000000004s)]
*  The one, the one, what if, I mean, the obvious, what [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3041.6400000000003s)]
*  if with the Rockets in 94, but the bigger, what if for me is that 93 [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3044.6s)]
*  bulls series, they were every bit as good as the 93 bulls and they were right there. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3048.7999999999997s)]
*  And that was an either or series and you could drive yourself crazy with that. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3053.16s)]
*  This is an amazing chance for them. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3057.48s)]
*  In the first round in 93, they beat the Pacers. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3059.52s)]
*  94 conference finals. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3063.64s)]
*  They beat the Pacers 95 second round. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3066.68s)]
*  I know you know all this, but I just want to set this up as a potential [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3070.56s)]
*  Nick Baser series second round. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3073.64s)]
*  The Pacers winning a game seven. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3075.96s)]
*  That's that's three, four, five. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3078.6s)]
*  They go head to head 98 second round. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3080.4s)]
*  The Pacers beat him again. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3082.44s)]
*  99 the Knicks win in the conference finals like that. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3083.24s)]
*  And then it's not just like last year and then in 2000, the Pacers beat them. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3088.4s)]
*  Like Pacers Knicks is not like, I think this is like, people hype up like Celtics. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3093.2s)]
*  Knicks is a rivalry, but they don't really meet in the postseason. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3098.3599999999997s)]
*  Like I think if the Knicks have a rival, it is the Pacers. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3102.64s)]
*  Yeah, which is so weird. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3106.4s)]
*  But I mean, there was one of the first 30 for 30s was made about the Knicks [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3107.56s)]
*  Pacers mid nineties rivalry. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3111.7999999999997s)]
*  It's a real, it's a real thing that exists. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3113.48s)]
*  But by the way, it was a really good documentary. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3114.96s)]
*  Who directed that? [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3117.8399999999997s)]
*  My guy, right? [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3118.48s)]
*  My guy, Dan Clores. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3119.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3120.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3121.7999999999997s)]
*  And Hicks vs. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3122.08s)]
*  Knicks. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3122.92s)]
*  Did they interview Jalen? [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3123.08s)]
*  They must have. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3125.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3126.4s)]
*  Jalen's in that. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3126.64s)]
*  Yeah, he must be. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3127.8799999999997s)]
*  He's Jalen Rose. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3128.8399999999997s)]
*  TNT Jalen Rose killing it. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3130.6s)]
*  Racing, racing Dwight Howard to the monitor. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3131.92s)]
*  Dwight, Dwight's in slippers. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3134.7599999999998s)]
*  What are you even doing? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3136.04s)]
*  What are you even doing? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3136.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3137.44s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3137.68s)]
*  Dwight? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3138.12s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3138.44s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3139.2s)]
*  Dwight? [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3140.2s)]
*  What are you doing there? [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3140.6s)]
*  Dwight? [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3141.3599999999997s)]
*  How about that? [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3141.7999999999997s)]
*  And I think that again, like I revisited last year's Pacers Knicks series. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3143.4s)]
*  And if there is a Pacers Knicks finals, it's Eastern Conference finals, which I believe [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3146.88s)]
*  there will be. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3149.8399999999997s)]
*  It's it. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3150.7999999999997s)]
*  It was a lot closer than I remember. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3151.96s)]
*  And OG getting hurt was huge. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3153.64s)]
*  Brunson getting hurt. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3155.6s)]
*  Like it wasn't just. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3156.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3158.68s)]
*  I just feel like it's a good matchup and I've listened to your stupid pod and I [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3159.08s)]
*  know you're all Pacers all the time and like all the basketball people are so [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3162.36s)]
*  excited about the Pacers, but I think the Knicks should be and will win that [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3165.48s)]
*  series if it comes down to it. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3168.7200000000003s)]
*  Fandual updated their Knicks Celtics odds. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3170.64s)]
*  Oh God. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3174.08s)]
*  And the Knicks are now minus 270. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3175.32s)]
*  They were I think minus 620 heading into today's game. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3178.04s)]
*  The Celtics were minus 900 before the series started. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3180.84s)]
*  And the last game. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3183.96s)]
*  The volatility of this for the playoffs. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3184.6s)]
*  I mean, for the conference, Knicks are plus 125 and Indiana is also plus 125. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3187.72s)]
*  It's so I just think that I would hate that this goes down as like the series [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3193.7599999999998s)]
*  where Tatum got hurt because I really liked it as the series where the Knicks [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3197.72s)]
*  shit the bed and game one at home and shit the bed and game two at home and [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3200.36s)]
*  then DNA in the pool and game four. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3203.36s)]
*  That was my favorite. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3206.0s)]
*  That was my favorite part of the DNA in the pool game. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3206.84s)]
*  Well, what's crazy about game four, the Tatum injury puts a little bit of a black [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3211.0s)]
*  cloud over what would have been one of the great Knicks wins ever and still is. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3216.52s)]
*  Oh, what a great game, dude. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3220.24s)]
*  One of the great games. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3221.56s)]
*  But now, now you have this Friday night game six ticket in New York City, which [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3223.2s)]
*  I think will be the hardest Knicks ticket to get. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3228.7599999999998s)]
*  Um, I don't even know when, I don't know if the demand for the 99 finals was even [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3231.7599999999998s)]
*  up there because it just feels like there's more Knicks fans now. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3236.96s)]
*  There's two new generations of Nick fans since 99. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3239.32s)]
*  Um, everyone's going to want to be at this game and it's going to be an [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3242.92s)]
*  incredible game. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3245.76s)]
*  I've got a couple of things on that. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3247.1600000000003s)]
*  Um, one is I wanted to go to game four because we were doing the mismatch after [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3249.0800000000004s)]
*  the game and I was like, it'd be good for the show, whatever. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3252.6000000000004s)]
*  I was like, you know, I've, I've got some expendable money. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3254.92s)]
*  I'll just do it. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3258.0s)]
*  It was like $900 to sit like in the last row. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3259.2000000000003s)]
*  I just couldn't bring myself. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3262.5600000000004s)]
*  It's 900. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3263.6400000000003s)]
*  Like, I just can't, like, I've got children. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3264.5200000000004s)]
*  Like, I just can't do it. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3266.2000000000003s)]
*  And another story I want to tell about game two is they have the wash party [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3267.5600000000004s)]
*  outside of the garden, right? [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3271.96s)]
*  They kind of like, there's a plaza there. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3273.1600000000003s)]
*  Just like most places do like beer garden in Milwaukee or whatever. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3274.92s)]
*  And I was doing, um, the Spotify new fronts, shop to the sales, Spotify [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3278.2000000000003s)]
*  people, and I did that event and it was right next to that watch party. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3282.52s)]
*  And it was like the second quarter. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3286.76s)]
*  I went to a bar by the garden and I had a couple of beers and watched the game. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3288.2000000000003s)]
*  And they started to come back and I was like, you know what I'm going to do? [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3293.08s)]
*  I'm see if they win and I'm going to go to the watch party. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3295.92s)]
*  Cause you've seen this stuff on social from that area. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3299.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3301.92s)]
*  And I went there and I was super excited about the energy from the [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3303.0s)]
*  Knicks fans and everything, but it was really a commentary on like the content [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3308.48s)]
*  creation generation because everyone was there with their phones out to [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3312.3599999999997s)]
*  create content for social to show people that they were there. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3317.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3320.72s)]
*  It was me too. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3320.8799999999997s)]
*  I did the exact same thing, but it's not this, like, I remember me and Kevin [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3322.08s)]
*  Wilds went to seventh Avenue outside the Riviera after the, um, the Red Sox [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3326.96s)]
*  beat the Yankees and seventh Avenue was shut down. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3332.28s)]
*  It was all Red Sox fans and we were all there together, just high-fiving [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3335.08s)]
*  each other, being a big family. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3338.2000000000003s)]
*  And it was before video was on the internet. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3339.6800000000003s)]
*  So we weren't like capturing things on our phones. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3341.12s)]
*  And again, I sound like an old guy or whatever, but like, when I went to this [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3343.12s)]
*  one, I was doing the same thing. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3346.52s)]
*  It was just kind of like, who's got the best shot for my Instagram story. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3348.64s)]
*  So you're looking at your cruising, the crowd being like, who's the most [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3353.64s)]
*  excited, who's got the best chance? [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3356.72s)]
*  Who can I film for this moment? [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3359.04s)]
*  So I think that when you view it and you're not there, it's a very [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3362.24s)]
*  different experience than living it. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3366.3199999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3368.3999999999996s)]
*  Be like, if you were telling me that story right now and I was like, yeah, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3368.8399999999997s)]
*  hold on, yeah, it's exactly what I was like. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3371.8799999999997s)]
*  It was kind of like, I get it. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3376.04s)]
*  I'm guilty. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3377.7599999999998s)]
*  I did it too. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3378.52s)]
*  I'm not being critical. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3379.24s)]
*  It was just like a, it's just a different time. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3380.3199999999997s)]
*  It's like when you go to a concert and people are just like filming the [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3382.04s)]
*  concert, like there's professional cameras, like if you want to watch this later, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3383.84s)]
*  you can do that. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3387.08s)]
*  How about you just chill and watch it now? [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3387.88s)]
*  I'm always, I always find that amazing. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3389.96s)]
*  You know, I go to a few basketball games and people will tape like the national [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3392.6400000000003s)]
*  anthem, they'll record like the cheerleaders. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3396.52s)]
*  They're like, yeah, cheerleaders. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3400.8s)]
*  And it's like, we have to all be recorded by professionals. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3402.56s)]
*  I was actually getting met the game for Quipper's nuggets, which Yoke just [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3406.08s)]
*  played one of the best games I've seen in person in a long time. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3409.6400000000003s)]
*  And there were a couple influencers sitting in front of us, just oblivious to [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3412.64s)]
*  it and try just hoping that the game would be closed so they could tape the [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3416.28s)]
*  thing and then do this. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3420.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3422.32s)]
*  And I'm just, I just wanted to like, just hit them over the head with a Coke can. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3423.8s)]
*  It's just like, how can you not focus on this guy is one of the best basketball [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3428.36s)]
*  players of the last 30 years and he's like painting a masterpiece right now. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3432.8s)]
*  And you guys are fucking on Tik TOK. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3437.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3439.48s)]
*  Get off our lawn Jacoby. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3440.0s)]
*  We sound like old guys and I get it, but it's like, I paid a thousand dollars to [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3441.28s)]
*  watch them do their thing, but you really paid a thousand dollars to like film [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3445.2000000000003s)]
*  yourself watching them do their thing for the people that are following you or [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3448.2400000000002s)]
*  whatever. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3450.6000000000004s)]
*  And who's watching this video in 40 years? [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3450.96s)]
*  Like your kids are like, oh yeah, I'm still deleting dad's iCloud. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3453.52s)]
*  He's at some Quipper game. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3458.6400000000003s)]
*  Just taking photos of the cheerleaders. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3460.2400000000002s)]
*  We're putting up Instagram stories. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3462.92s)]
*  It literally disappears in 24 hours. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3464.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3465.84s)]
*  It disappears in 24 hours. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3466.0800000000004s)]
*  Speaking of Yoke-age, I was so bummed. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3468.2000000000003s)]
*  I just, I just love that guy. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3470.2s)]
*  I was so bummed out last night. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3471.96s)]
*  The first three plus quarters. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3473.3199999999997s)]
*  That was unbelievable. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3476.7599999999998s)]
*  Watching him do that to OKC where he's deciding every moment of every situation. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3478.64s)]
*  And just single-handedly dragging the nuggets to the finish line. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3485.72s)]
*  And then it just came down to Lou Dort made a couple of shots. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3489.0s)]
*  Jalen Williams made a three that I never thought was going in and the nuggets [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3491.48s)]
*  missed basically every open shot they took. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3495.6s)]
*  And all of a sudden nuggets were going home and they look like they're screwed. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3498.48s)]
*  So I don't want to make this too reductive, right? [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3501.6400000000003s)]
*  But doesn't it just come down to a coach decides who we're going to leave open and [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3504.52s)]
*  whether or not that person makes the shot. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3509.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3510.76s)]
*  It's like very reductive. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3511.04s)]
*  It's like, we're going to leave Lou Dort open. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3512.0s)]
*  It's like, oh, Porter Jr. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3513.4s)]
*  He's got a hurt shoulder. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3515.88s)]
*  He hasn't hit. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3516.7200000000003s)]
*  We're going to leave him open. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3517.36s)]
*  Porter Jr. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3517.88s)]
*  And Westbrook, like it barely hit the rim in the fourth quarter. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3519.1200000000003s)]
*  Well with Russ, they're like, yo, did you see that Ramona story about Russ with the [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3522.08s)]
*  unnamed teammate? [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3525.28s)]
*  Let's leave him open. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3526.04s)]
*  Porter's got one arm. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3528.08s)]
*  Russ is pissed about the story. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3529.6800000000003s)]
*  We'll leave him open. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3531.2000000000003s)]
*  If that Peyton, Peyton Watson comes in, leave him open Strother open. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3532.44s)]
*  You're just pointing at guys that just, they're going to be open. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3537.48s)]
*  And then the Jalen Williams won. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3541.48s)]
*  It hit the front room in the back room and went in. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3544.52s)]
*  Like he looked a little surprised after it went into, if you had freeze frame [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3546.28s)]
*  that and it was the biggest shot of the game, front rim, I would have said 10% [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3550.04s)]
*  nuts. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3557.32s)]
*  I didn't think I, you wouldn't, you could have talked to me in an air ball or a hits [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3558.6800000000003s)]
*  the side of the backboard before it hits the rim. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3562.96s)]
*  I just thought no chance, but he's pretty good at that game. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3564.84s)]
*  I still don't trust him. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3567.0800000000004s)]
*  I think it's also worth mentioning the SGA three when they're up by three and he [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3568.04s)]
*  could, he, they go under the screen and he's just like, you motherfucker. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3573.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm the MVP. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3576.88s)]
*  You're going to let me shoot this. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3578.04s)]
*  And that one didn't touch the rim at all. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3579.44s)]
*  That was pure. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3581.8s)]
*  And that was a dagger. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3582.92s)]
*  That was a night night shot. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3583.84s)]
*  And one thing I want to say about yoga, which was I was so, so when he had that [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3585.32s)]
*  offensive rebound, when he tipped it to himself to put it back in, he's like, you [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3588.88s)]
*  motherfuckers can't even hit a shot. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3592.6s)]
*  I'm going to go down there and do everything. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3595.16s)]
*  I'm just going to do everything. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3597.64s)]
*  I'm going to make dinner. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3599.24s)]
*  It's like when our wives clean the dishes. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3600.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3601.84s)]
*  I'm going to make it. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3602.64s)]
*  I'm going to clean the dishes. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3603.4s)]
*  I'm going to clean up after we clean up dishes flying around. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3604.2799999999997s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3608.6s)]
*  What was happening? [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3609.2s)]
*  He's just like, you know what? [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3610.08s)]
*  You're not an asset. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3611.2s)]
*  The rest of you four are not an asset to me, but don't worry. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3612.6s)]
*  I got this and he almost did. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3616.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3619.0s)]
*  The coach afterwards was talking about how, you know, I had to play a little [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3619.16s)]
*  rush roulette there basically with the okay. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3622.76s)]
*  So I just had to keep them out there and keep our fingers crossed. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3624.56s)]
*  It's like, yeah, cause what else were you going to do? [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3626.96s)]
*  The moment he comes out, you're going to be minus 10. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3630.08s)]
*  The second he steps out of the game. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3633.64s)]
*  It's weird. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3635.56s)]
*  I felt that first of all, I thought that was the best playoff game. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3637.0s)]
*  I think of the whole playoffs, just from a quality of play standpoint, [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3640.08s)]
*  Nick Celtics game four was that was an exciting game. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3643.4s)]
*  This was like exceptionally well played, like the execution defense. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3647.8s)]
*  The execution was just went to a whole other level. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3652.8s)]
*  I'm sorry, but when Westbrook has two air balls and Michael Porter Jr. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3655.84s)]
*  has two air balls, it's hard for me to talk about the execution about all the [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3658.92s)]
*  stuff Yoke Edge had to just see and deal with. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3662.92s)]
*  It was like a quarterback just being blitzed every play, just trying to [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3665.4s)]
*  figure out what to do. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3668.36s)]
*  So weirdly like, like I voted for him for MVP. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3669.84s)]
*  I feel better that I voted for him after watching that game, but SGA was equally [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3672.32s)]
*  awesome down the stretch and showed all the reasons why if you voted for him, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3676.76s)]
*  you'd feel good about that, right? [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3681.1200000000003s)]
*  He's got a good team, but when they really needed him, he made just about every [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3682.48s)]
*  play it felt like to help them. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3686.2000000000003s)]
*  So it was weird to watch a game where both guys won. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3688.32s)]
*  They had that moment where they kind of traded baskets for a second. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3691.1600000000003s)]
*  And I was like, this is what a great MVP race that was. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3694.52s)]
*  Cause both of these guys are incredible. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3697.5600000000004s)]
*  And Yoke Edge is, there's just nobody like this. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3699.44s)]
*  They, you know, I keep talking about in the pods that we're just, we're not [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3702.76s)]
*  going to see anything like this again for a while. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3706.84s)]
*  Well, one of the things I loved about that Yoke Edge performance was the 48 [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3709.1200000000003s)]
*  hours between game four and game five was turnover to assist ratio and the [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3714.0800000000004s)]
*  worst he's ever shot from the field. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3719.8s)]
*  It was this kind of like have the thunder solve the Yoke Edge problem. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3721.6400000000003s)]
*  And you've watched enough Yoke Edge. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3725.1600000000003s)]
*  You're like, okay guys. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3726.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3727.96s)]
*  Well, we'll see if you've solved the, people have been trying to solve the [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3728.36s)]
*  Yoke Edge problem for three years now. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3731.52s)]
*  Like there, there, you cannot solve the Yoke Edge problem. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3733.4s)]
*  It's like Matt Damon in good hunting and the chalkboard. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3736.0s)]
*  It's like there, you cannot do it. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3738.04s)]
*  It's impossible. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3739.8s)]
*  You know, it's, he approaches basketball. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3740.32s)]
*  It's like when you, when you watch golf and they talk about Scotty [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3743.48s)]
*  Scheffler, uh, 24th last week, fixed something in his swing. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3747.16s)]
*  And he said he was leaning back a little bit on his drives and then he'll just [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3753.36s)]
*  rip a drive straight down the fairway and like, oh yeah, I fixed the swing. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3757.12s)]
*  Yoke Edge is like doing that during a series where it's like. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3760.0s)]
*  Nicole Yoke Edge, uh, didn't have a great game for, he noticed some things in the [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3763.72s)]
*  tape, he fixed his whatever. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3767.88s)]
*  And then it's just like, he's completely solved. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3770.3599999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3772.2s)]
*  See who's doing the same thing. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3772.48s)]
*  But now instead of, instead of speeding them up, making them do things [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3774.64s)]
*  he doesn't want to do, he's just, he's just on it. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3777.48s)]
*  Like he's got them on a fucking yo-yo. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3779.92s)]
*  I thought, I just thought he was so awesome in that game. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3781.92s)]
*  It's a much more fun series if Denver wins that game and we get to really see [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3785.4s)]
*  okay, see with their backs to the wall. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3790.6800000000003s)]
*  Under pressure. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3792.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3792.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3793.1200000000003s)]
*  It's like, okay guys, go to Denver. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3793.52s)]
*  Let's see if you can win this one. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3795.7200000000003s)]
*  Um, Cleveland was in this similar situation yesterday and they just cratered from it. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3797.48s)]
*  They couldn't handle it. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3802.2400000000002s)]
*  It was a, it was a full fledged cratering. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3804.0s)]
*  I think there's a good parallel there between Yoke Edge and Mitchell where it's [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3807.36s)]
*  like, I'm standing on my head here, guys. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3811.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm giving you 40 plus. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3813.36s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3814.92s)]
*  Like, like Mitchell's hurt. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3815.48s)]
*  He, and like, he didn't play great, but remember in the, in the, was the fourth [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3817.6400000000003s)]
*  quarter he had like three straight threes. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3821.1600000000003s)]
*  He's just like, guys, like, I just need some help. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3822.96s)]
*  Like Max Struz, like do something. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3825.04s)]
*  Like Michael Porter Jr. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3827.52s)]
*  Do just, I'm not asking you to be superstars. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3828.36s)]
*  All these guys are good in the regular season. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3830.84s)]
*  Do something guys. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3832.7200000000003s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3834.6000000000004s)]
*  And, and remember, I'm sure you remember the Celtic series last year was a similar [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3835.1600000000003s)]
*  thing with Mitchell. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3838.36s)]
*  It was just like, again, there's guys out, Garland was out and you know, but [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3838.92s)]
*  it's just hard. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3842.6800000000003s)]
*  You just, these guys need more help. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3843.7200000000003s)]
*  They need more help. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3845.48s)]
*  It happened to him in Utah too. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3846.0s)]
*  I'm wondering, maybe it's him. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3847.0s)]
*  Maybe it's not the sporting class. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3848.36s)]
*  No, I love Mitchell. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3849.96s)]
*  Maybe he's just eating too much of the food in the fridge and everybody else is [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3851.6400000000003s)]
*  just hungry and forgets how to eat. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3854.88s)]
*  I don't think that's how it works. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3857.0800000000004s)]
*  One of the things I love about Yoke Edge is like my kids don't care about [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3858.5600000000004s)]
*  basketball at all and they come into the room when I'm watching and I'm like, do [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3862.4s)]
*  you see that like slow kind of fat guy? [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3866.0800000000004s)]
*  Like that's the best basketball player in the planet. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3868.2000000000003s)]
*  Like that guy. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3870.6000000000004s)]
*  I'm like, and it's not even close. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3871.72s)]
*  He's definitely the best guy. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3873.12s)]
*  It's like the best. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3874.52s)]
*  We don't even argue about this anymore. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3875.68s)]
*  It's just like that guy right there. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3877.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, I'm like, watch, just watch it. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3879.8799999999997s)]
*  It like do some slow weird stuff. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3881.64s)]
*  I thought the scratches on his arms. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3883.0s)]
*  I love it. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3887.9199999999996s)]
*  I love it. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3888.4399999999996s)]
*  Um, all right. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3889.7599999999998s)]
*  Jacob's Friday night. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3890.9599999999996s)]
*  We'll see with the next perfect situation for them. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3893.16s)]
*  I'm sure they're going to learn some things from this tape. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3897.8799999999997s)]
*  I'm sure Luke Carnett's not going to do that again. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3899.88s)]
*  I'm sure they're going to attack Jalen Brown a little differently, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3901.88s)]
*  but still some pressure. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3904.28s)]
*  I, uh, I'm terrified. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3906.5600000000004s)]
*  They've been down 14 plus in every single game of the series, including today. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3909.6800000000003s)]
*  That's, that's, that's a fact that I can't dispute, but I feel really good about [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3914.28s)]
*  the next chances on Friday night. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3917.2000000000003s)]
*  Timothy Chalamet and his girlfriend will not let us lose. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3919.28s)]
*  When is the mismatch taping [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3922.52s)]
*  mismatch tapes Thursday after that thunder nuggets game. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3925.04s)]
*  And Averno has done a really good job of just really entrenching him in this, [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3929.24s)]
*  like the thunder are too young and they need to go through their playoff scars. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3932.72s)]
*  And they can't, there's no way they can beat the nuggets. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3935.72s)]
*  They've been there before championship pedigree and like, he's really, [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3938.6s)]
*  really rooted deep, deep down in this take in a way that I'm scared to do as [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3942.12s)]
*  someone who does this for a living. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3946.64s)]
*  And I'm really proud of him, but it's going to be a fun pod afterwards because [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3948.0s)]
*  he's either going to be really, really right or really, really wrong. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3952.52s)]
*  Well, there you go. I'm, he was really wrong about Memphis. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3956.0s)]
*  He thought Memphis had a window. They never even bought the window. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3960.6s)]
*  No, you in, you and him have something in common. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3964.0s)]
*  Yeah. Is when you guys are wrong about a take, you go straight into excuse mode. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3967.8s)]
*  Right. You know what I mean? Yeah. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3972.32s)]
*  Yeah. You do this too. It's, it's all, oh, it's because well, John Moran got hurt. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3974.92s)]
*  I mean, I didn't know John Moran was going to go down. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3978.32s)]
*  I didn't know Steph Curry was going to get hurt. It's always like, [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3980.24s)]
*  I'm right, but these extraneous circumstances created an environment in which I was [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3982.2s)]
*  wrong. It's not my fault. It's the world's fault. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3986.28s)]
*  It's smart. It's a great way to play it. It's good move. Dave Jacoby. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3990.12s)]
*  We got to do another rewatchables at some point too. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=3994.08s)]

*  Yeah. All right. Good to see you, my friend. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4000.44s)]
*  All right. We're recording this on a Monday, but it's going to run Wednesday. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4004.16s)]
*  Kathy Engelbert is here. WNBA commissioner. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4006.96s)]
*  Pretty exciting season coming ahead, including a new San Francisco expansion [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4010.48s)]
*  team. As you know, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4015.24s)]
*  my life with the WNBA has been complicated because I was not a fan for a long time. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4017.36s)]
*  And then as the years passed, [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4021.68s)]
*  really started to get into it the last couple of years. And I, [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4024.32s)]
*  I don't think I'm alone in that, right? [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4027.88s)]
*  How many new fans or converted fans have drifted in the last couple of years that [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4029.52s)]
*  you've seen? [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4034.44s)]
*  Yeah, definitely tens of millions. So, [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4035.44s)]
*  we were, you know, back when I joined, we were at the, you know, [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4038.88s)]
*  kind of on the outskirts of professional sports back in 2020. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4042.7999999999997s)]
*  And then the pandemic, we held the season in a bubble, [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4046.68s)]
*  down at IMG Academy and then just raised some capital in early [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4051.08s)]
*  2022, which gave confidence, I think, to our owners to start investing and build [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4055.52s)]
*  on the momentum. And then we got this amazing rookie class led by Caitlin Clark [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4060.24s)]
*  last year. So, yeah, so yes. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4063.68s)]
*  And the quality of the game, Bill, [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4066.88s)]
*  has really advanced enormously since I certainly played the game when there was [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4068.6000000000004s)]
*  no women's professional sports basketball league. So, [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4073.6800000000003s)]
*  I do take it with great responsibility that we are the longest tenured women's [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4077.56s)]
*  professional sports league in the U S by double any other, but you know, [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4081.2400000000002s)]
*  we've arrived for sure. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4084.52s)]
*  Yeah. It feels like when the whole Steph Curry era of how basketball, [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4086.04s)]
*  basketball got a little smaller, the shooting expanded out, [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4091.56s)]
*  there was more slash and kick stuff. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4094.6s)]
*  And I think that's helped the league more than anything for WNBA. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4097.16s)]
*  Like when you go back and you look at the games from 20, 25 years ago, [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4100.64s)]
*  and they were resembling, you know, everybody had like big players, [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4104.5599999999995s)]
*  you're trying to post up and establish. And now when you watch it, like the, [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4108.12s)]
*  the, the pace of it's better, the skills bet, like I, [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4113.12s)]
*  I just, I like, I went to a finals game and I was like blown away by, [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4117.5599999999995s)]
*  by the quality of it. And also there's a bunch of good players. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4122.52s)]
*  You're in like a really nice little talent boom here. Right. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4125.72s)]
*  And then you had this rookie class. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4129.280000000001s)]
*  During Asia Wilson and if he's a Collier and just, you know, [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4131.56s)]
*  you know, to add into the rookie and we have another great rookie class off of [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4136.4400000000005s)]
*  our draft this year with Paige Becker's and Kiki Iriafen. And I mean, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4139.4800000000005s)]
*  personalities like huge personalities too. So I think that's has arrived, [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4144.120000000001s)]
*  but literally there's so much that we were hitting this confluence in women's [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4148.04s)]
*  sports and the WNBA. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4152.0s)]
*  We were kind of ahead of the curve and raising that capital back in 22. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4153.84s)]
*  Now there's so much capital coming in and partners and corporate partners. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4156.64s)]
*  And you know, [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4161.12s)]
*  it's led to kind of major investments on the player development side. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4162.36s)]
*  So when you have built that confidence in a business model, [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4166.12s)]
*  that's going to work in a sustainable, which is what I've been brought in to do. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4169.32s)]
*  It's you see the benefits of that, the returns of that. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4173.2s)]
*  And then you see, you know, some, an athlete, a generational athlete, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4177.24s)]
*  like Caitlin, I analogize it to the Tiger Woods effect in golf. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4181.04s)]
*  And just her followership and, [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4185.28s)]
*  and then the rivalries she came in with against Angel Reese and LSU Iowa. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4188.32s)]
*  And now Paige Becker is coming in from Yukon off her championship. So, [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4192.8s)]
*  but we had great players for many, many decades, for a couple of decades. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4197.2s)]
*  But now I think with social media, with NIL, [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4201.56s)]
*  with them having brands when they come in and followership and just the quality [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4204.84s)]
*  of the game. I can't say enough about that too. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4209.2s)]
*  Yeah. It's the old school model that I'm sure we both grew up with where you'd [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4212.28s)]
*  watch the players in college for a couple of years. They would come to the NBA. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4216.56s)]
*  You feel like you knew him. You know, [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4220.56s)]
*  like Ewing was at Georgetown for four years. It was like, [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4222.2s)]
*  I knew that guy by the time he got to the Knicks and the NBA. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4225.16s)]
*  I think the one thing, not that the NBA is doing badly, [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4228.76s)]
*  but the one thing that they lost a little bit as the one and done era started was [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4231.76s)]
*  just not having these guys would come in and they would go to bad teams. And, [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4235.92s)]
*  you know, for every Anthony Edwards, [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4239.6s)]
*  there will be other guys that might show up on a team, [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4241.56s)]
*  not make the playoffs for five years. You just didn't have the same connection. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4244.4400000000005s)]
*  You have this advantage now that I mean that you're using college basketball as [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4247.8s)]
*  this amazing feeder system. You know, [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4251.52s)]
*  like when Juju got hurt during the tournament, it was like, ah, like, [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4254.2s)]
*  I was so excited to see if she, what, what team she, [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4258.92s)]
*  if she was going to come out for the draft, what team she might go for. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4261.44s)]
*  But you just feel like a different connection. So Paige Becker is, [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4265.4s)]
*  I feel like she's been in college for forever. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4268.08s)]
*  Whereas like Cooper flag was at Duke for six months. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4270.8s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's a, it's a very good point. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4274.6s)]
*  And the other thing is the brands are seeing the value of these athletes staying [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4276.4s)]
*  in college because again, under our current CPA, [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4280.36s)]
*  you have to be 22 by the end of the calendar year in which you get drafted. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4282.8s)]
*  If you're in the U S university system. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4285.8s)]
*  Right. So Juju couldn't even come out. Yeah. She couldn't come out. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4287.5199999999995s)]
*  Right. So we wish her well, [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4291.839999999999s)]
*  she's going to be an amazing player in the WNBA someday. But obviously, [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4294.28s)]
*  I had that injury during the tournament, but yeah. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4298.28s)]
*  So I do think that brands get to know them, fans get to know them, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4301.48s)]
*  they come out and they thrive in the W. I mean, as hard as, [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4306.24s)]
*  and as competitive as the W is, [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4309.36s)]
*  they not only have a local and kind of regional brand like they have in college, [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4311.5599999999995s)]
*  but then they have a national on it actually now a global brand. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4316.0s)]
*  So I think it's kind of cool to watch that. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4319.2s)]
*  Well, and then the number two pick in the draft, the YouTube clips were nuts. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4321.52s)]
*  And it seemed like one of those things like, obviously Becker is going to go first. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4326.84s)]
*  She's famous. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4329.84s)]
*  Like you can build a franchise around her and she's excellent and she's won [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4330.64s)]
*  everywhere she's been. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4333.84s)]
*  Then you have this French kid that when you watch that I did, [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4335.6s)]
*  I did a token YouTube deep dive on her. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4340.92s)]
*  I was like, I'm not quite sure I've seen this before, women's basketball. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4344.08s)]
*  So how do you like market somebody like that? [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4348.6s)]
*  Yeah. So Dominique Malunga is her name. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4351.200000000001s)]
*  She was drafted number two to the Seattle storm and our GMs are really smart. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4352.92s)]
*  They're looking at the global talent pool. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4356.68s)]
*  I think four of our top 12 picks this year were players born outside the United [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4358.6s)]
*  States. So including one that was in the university system from Australia, [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4363.4400000000005s)]
*  but it's incredible what Dominique is. I mean, again, [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4367.76s)]
*  I met her at the draft, but we brought her over from France, but you know, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4371.8s)]
*  what she's doing effortlessly around her athleticism dunking. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4375.88s)]
*  So we'll see she'll help lift Seattle and we're going to have a lot of priority [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4379.76s)]
*  in the league this year, Bill. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4383.84s)]
*  And it's not just going to be two teams like it's been in the past or three, [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4385.24s)]
*  I think six, seven teams are really going to compete hard for the championship [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4388.360000000001s)]
*  this year. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4391.6s)]
*  Yeah. With her, like the dunking, [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4392.4400000000005s)]
*  everybody gets excited if a woman's bird dunks going back to like, you know, [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4393.8s)]
*  the eighties, the way she moves is just different. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4397.4800000000005s)]
*  And to me, when I was watching, I was like, [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4400.96s)]
*  I don't know if I've seen a player navigate the court like this at this size. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4402.92s)]
*  So that'll be fun. You know, [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4406.76s)]
*  you mentioned how the leagues in this awesome place right now, right? You 13, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4408.4800000000005s)]
*  you have the San Francisco team is going to be launching. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4412.72s)]
*  I think you have Portland and Toronto coming down the road. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4416.4s)]
*  Next year, Portland and Toronto. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4419.8s)]
*  So it's going to be 15. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4421.56s)]
*  15. Yep. So we're looking at, [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4423.4s)]
*  I've kind of talked about getting to 16 by no later than the end of 28. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4425.6s)]
*  Uh, so let's talk about that though, [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4430.280000000001s)]
*  because the history of when professional sports leagues grow and things start to [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4432.360000000001s)]
*  get a little good, and then they start expansion for a couple of expanding, [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4438.08s)]
*  cause you get the expansion fees, there's interest, there's money in there. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4441.240000000001s)]
*  What's the, what's the right number of teams? Cause for me, I, I, [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4445.64s)]
*  I don't think it should be more than 16. Like, [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4450.08s)]
*  I'm really hoping that you don't all of a sudden you're at 24 and you end up in [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4452.360000000001s)]
*  a situation where the teams, you know, [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4457.36s)]
*  everybody just has one good player and that's it. Like, [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4460.48s)]
*  how do you know what the right number is? [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4463.799999999999s)]
*  It's excellent timing to be talking about it because we do have so much [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4465.88s)]
*  interest from some great cities. And I, [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4469.12s)]
*  I knew when I joined the league when technology is driving so much of your [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4471.4s)]
*  economy and you don't have a team in the Bay area, San Francisco, [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4474.16s)]
*  that we needed to fix first. Uh, [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4477.2s)]
*  and then Toronto and Portland and Toronto is such a great sports market. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4479.92s)]
*  And after that Raptors win, [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4482.96s)]
*  when I was actually being courted to come into the WNBA, [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4484.5599999999995s)]
*  the Raptors won the NBA championship that year. Uh, [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4487.28s)]
*  and so I knew Toronto would be a great place, Portland, [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4490.4s)]
*  great place for women's sports. So you, I think you're right, Bill. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4492.84s)]
*  You don't want to degrade the quality of the game by bringing in too many teams [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4496.08s)]
*  too fast. That's why people felt like my first thing I should have done is when I [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4499.639999999999s)]
*  came in was expansion. And I said, no, [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4504.0s)]
*  we've got a lot of transformation of the business model, the economic model. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4505.88s)]
*  We got to build confidence in this league, [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4509.16s)]
*  bring investment into this league and capital, [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4511.6s)]
*  get our owners all on the same page. And so that's what we've done. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4513.68s)]
*  And now it's time to expand, [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4517.4800000000005s)]
*  which you're going to see the Valkyries this year out in San Francisco. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4518.88s)]
*  Yeah, they're like sold out right away, right? [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4523.96s)]
*  They have, [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4527.4800000000005s)]
*  they have more season ticket holders than any team in the history of the WNBA. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4528.04s)]
*  And what's really interesting, Bill, and this tells you about the W, uh, [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4532.0s)]
*  less than 5% of those season ticket holders are Golden State warrior season [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4536.0s)]
*  ticket holders, but they're owned by the same ownership group. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4540.52s)]
*  They're going to play in Chase center. That's an amazing stat because we know [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4542.76s)]
*  that our, um, you know, we, we have such a great fan base and, um, [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4546.76s)]
*  it just brings in a whole new fan base, a whole new media market for us. Uh, [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4551.200000000001s)]
*  same with Toronto having kind of the country of Canada. Uh, so, you know, [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4554.92s)]
*  more to come, but you're right. We're, [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4559.280000000001s)]
*  we're currently evaluating and really putting together an analysis of what the [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4560.68s)]
*  right numbers of team teams are and when, [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4565.0s)]
*  but we do have a huge amount of demand, low supply, high demand, [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4567.68s)]
*  uh, from some great cities that you would say would be a no brainer for WNBA. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4572.88s)]
*  Low supply, high demand is a good thing, but yeah, you go back, [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4577.200000000001s)]
*  you go back 60, 70 years with sports. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4580.320000000001s)]
*  This is how you get in trouble when you're like, Hey, we're doing good. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4583.72s)]
*  Let's grab some teams. So you had a year and a half ago, [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4586.52s)]
*  Portland and Golden State were the expansion teams. And I think it was like, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4591.12s)]
*  what was it? 50 million was the fee. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4595.5599999999995s)]
*  They varied. So Golden State was different than Toronto, [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4598.8s)]
*  which was different from Portland, which will be very different from team 16. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4601.16s)]
*  Portland was 50 and now the price is like 125 to get in. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4605.0s)]
*  So it's already gone up two and a half times in a year and a half. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4610.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's, it's incredible what has happened. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4612.759999999999s)]
*  But if you just look at the revenue teams are building, [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4615.12s)]
*  there's going to be some valuations coming out from both Sportico and Forbes, [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4618.36s)]
*  uh, in the next few months, [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4622.48s)]
*  I think that are going to show an enormous increase in the valuation of [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4623.32s)]
*  the teams because revenue is not, whether it's from gate, [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4628.08s)]
*  whether it's some corporate partnerships, whether it's from merch. Um, you know, [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4631.08s)]
*  there's a lot of things that lead into a multiple on revenue and a confidence in [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4634.84s)]
*  the risk underlying that multiple. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4638.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. That always helps. Um, I feel like, [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4641.36s)]
*  so you have 40 game season. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4646.96s)]
*  44 this year. So most definitely. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4648.799999999999s)]
*  44 we bumped up. That's the max under the CBA. We can play 44. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4651.72s)]
*  So last year it was hard to play that cause it was an Olympic year and we had to [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4656.6s)]
*  break for the Olympics in the middle of our season. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4659.76s)]
*  But this year no international competition. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4662.08s)]
*  We can comfortably play 44 with our footprint. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4664.16s)]
*  Okay. So that's 22 home games. And then the playoffs. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4666.92s)]
*  You're looking at playoffs this year. We have a little evolution as well. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4672.04s)]
*  The first round. So we're a three, five, seven now first ever. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4675.64s)]
*  You went seven. I missed that. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4679.5199999999995s)]
*  Finals. That's exciting. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4682.04s)]
*  Seven games and bill you came to that Minnesota New York game. Um, [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4683.5199999999995s)]
*  can you imagine that went full five games to overtime? [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4687.84s)]
*  Can you imagine if that has been a seven game? [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4692.24s)]
*  And that was one of my goals is to get our finals to seven game series cause [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4693.92s)]
*  sports leagues play seven game series like you're seeing in the NBA right now. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4697.64s)]
*  So in game sevens are one of the most exciting things I think in sports. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4702.32s)]
*  So we'll have seven games and even our first round now will be one, [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4705.72s)]
*  one, one instead of two ones. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4709.280000000001s)]
*  So everybody will get a home game that makes the playoffs. So yeah, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4710.88s)]
*  we're evolving that with the footprint we have. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4714.320000000001s)]
*  All right. So before you took the job, you're looking back at the 2010s, [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4717.52s)]
*  which the WNBA was in such bad shape that Diana Torasi, [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4721.76s)]
*  who's the best part of the history of the league just decided to skip a season [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4725.4800000000005s)]
*  cause it wasn't worth enough money for her and she was making more money [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4730.2s)]
*  overseas and it seemed bleak. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4734.08s)]
*  It seemed like a business that wasn't going to make it and that the NBA was [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4736.48s)]
*  basically subsidizing almost like a charity case. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4740.6s)]
*  So what flips over the last eight years other than Caitlin Clark, [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4744.04s)]
*  what are the big reasons? Cause, but even before Caitlin came into the league, [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4749.0s)]
*  this was, this was happening. So style of play, [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4752.16s)]
*  what else do you think it was? [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4756.04s)]
*  Yeah, one of the things I looked at when I came in, I said, like, [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4757.84s)]
*  we need a strategy. We set, I do everything in threes. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4760.04s)]
*  So I said, we got to be player first, stakeholder success, [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4763.719999999999s)]
*  including owners and players, et cetera. And fan engagement. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4768.08s)]
*  We had to make it easier to be a fan. So we set off on this path, [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4771.4s)]
*  but that sat on the foundation called the game, [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4774.919999999999s)]
*  which I thought had never been better both at college and into the WNBA, [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4777.719999999999s)]
*  the brand, which was really strong, the organization team and league, [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4782.0s)]
*  which were a total mess and we needed to transform and hire capital. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4786.2s)]
*  And then the ecosystem could think media companies, [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4790.44s)]
*  corporate partners were less than 1% of all corporate partnership dollars in [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4792.76s)]
*  sports back in 2019 were going to women's sports and less than 5% of all media [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4796.56s)]
*  coverage going to sports was going to women's sports. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4801.32s)]
*  So what changed is this confluence that I was talking about, [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4803.88s)]
*  capital coming into the league, confidence building, valuations going up, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4808.4800000000005s)]
*  higher demand, new facilities, better amenities. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4813.04s)]
*  We did kind of what we called a historic CBA back in 2020. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4816.719999999999s)]
*  Now we're in another one and we'll do something transformational this year, [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4819.879999999999s)]
*  but it's a confluence of all that and this popularity of the game. I mean, [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4823.16s)]
*  basketball is the number one team sport in the United States and it's two [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4826.799999999999s)]
*  globally. So next to soccer. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4831.0s)]
*  So it's really an amazing time to be in women's sports and then in women's [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4832.959999999999s)]
*  basketball. So, but let's not, this has been really hard, hardest. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4837.919999999999s)]
*  I mean, I spent 33 years before I came here in business. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4842.08s)]
*  This has been the hardest five years because we had to, [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4844.64s)]
*  every rock we picked up, we had to transform something under it. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4848.84s)]
*  And last year my mantra was the bold will win. Everything must change. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4852.320000000001s)]
*  And that was even before I knew Caitlin was even coming into the league. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4856.72s)]
*  And then this year it's sustaining gains. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4859.88s)]
*  So I always have a mantra every year, but we stick with this strategy, [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4861.72s)]
*  player first, stakeholder success, fan engagement. We've hired engineers, [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4864.56s)]
*  social media. We had none of that. I had 12 people in the league when I joined. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4869.52s)]
*  And that we had no growth engine and now we have 25 people driving growth at the [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4873.12s)]
*  league level. We had one marketing person when I joined. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4876.76s)]
*  Now we have close to 30 marketing people. I hired a CMO, [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4879.88s)]
*  who was a long-term time Nike professional. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4883.72s)]
*  So I mean, it's just been a great lesson in you need financial capital, [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4887.48s)]
*  hire human capital, but you need the people to grow their business. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4891.84s)]
*  So we were ready. I didn't know this was coming as quickly as it did. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4894.28s)]
*  I thought we'd need three or four more years. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4898.04s)]
*  And what happened last year with sellout arenas and record breaking viewership. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4899.76s)]
*  And look at our preseason this year, Bill, [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4903.4400000000005s)]
*  we just had like sold out college arenas. That was the other thing I wanted to, [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4906.4800000000005s)]
*  how do you get the NCAA viewer into the W viewership? [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4910.360000000001s)]
*  And one of the ways to go back to those college arenas, like we did, uh, with, [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4914.52s)]
*  you know, going to Iowa and Notre Dame, LSU, [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4919.08s)]
*  and then Sabrina and the Liberty will be playing in the world again. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4921.72s)]
*  So leading into the tip of the season. So, um, yeah, it's, [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4924.88s)]
*  you know, just every idea we can be bold. We're a smaller league, [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4929.5199999999995s)]
*  a smaller brand, but we can be bold and really bring, [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4933.56s)]
*  bring what our fans want. And we've been listening a lot. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4936.64s)]
*  I would throw in two other things. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4939.96s)]
*  One is the woman's final four that Friday night on ESPN, especially that [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4941.84s)]
*  semi-finals doubleheader. It felt like all this, and it was doing well, [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4946.24s)]
*  but it felt like something shifted with that, [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4950.68s)]
*  where that really became like a casual sports fan event, [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4952.72s)]
*  not just the real basketball fans, but everybody. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4956.56s)]
*  And all of a sudden those games seem to really matter. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4958.92s)]
*  And then that becomes the feeder system. The other thing, [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4961.92s)]
*  you had a couple of owners that actually gave a shit and, [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4965.0s)]
*  and looked at, looked at their franchises and their place in the league as I, [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4968.92s)]
*  and tried to innovate. Like it seemed like the size with the, uh, [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4973.32s)]
*  with the Liberty, like what Mark Davis did with Las Vegas with, uh, [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4977.16s)]
*  what did he do? Giveaway tickets for like three years to try to build, [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4982.2s)]
*  build support. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4985.92s)]
*  They weren't giving away, but they were cheap in the upper bowl. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4986.76s)]
*  But he was really trying to get people in the building to give a crap [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4990.360000000001s)]
*  about it. And that seems like, you know, those are, those are, [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4995.280000000001s)]
*  I think two of the sterling leaders of the league now, [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=4998.68s)]
*  but it seems like cause the owners really care. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5002.400000000001s)]
*  It's so it's almost like a neighborhood where once people start fixing up their [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5004.72s)]
*  house, then everybody feels like they have to fix up their house. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5007.72s)]
*  And I think also it was like the confidence, like when I came into the league, [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5010.72s)]
*  the owners, um, of which the size were just joining the league. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5014.12s)]
*  Mark wasn't in the league yet. MGM owned the ACEs. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5018.16s)]
*  The owners were all in on something called a go big. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5020.6s)]
*  So literally it was go big or go home. When I was interviewing for the role, [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5023.04s)]
*  go big or go home. So all the owners saw something in the future. It was just, [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5026.36s)]
*  let's chart a path. Let's hire a commissioner. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5030.8s)]
*  Let's hire great human capital to execute it. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5033.12s)]
*  So I think that's when the size joined Mark joined a few years later. Uh, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5035.6s)]
*  and then they had, you know, Mark had a, uh, you know, [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5040.12s)]
*  before he got there and a couple of great drafts with an Asia Wilson and a Jackie [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5042.68s)]
*  Young and, um, you know, a few others, you know, [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5046.12s)]
*  Chelsea gray came from LA and for the agency. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5049.04s)]
*  And so I think that helps and it helps when you have those star players, [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5052.4800000000005s)]
*  New York attractive, [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5056.400000000001s)]
*  Graham Stewart and they had drafted Sabrina Nesco who had gotten hurt her rookie [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5057.280000000001s)]
*  season in our bubble. So, um, and you know, [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5061.360000000001s)]
*  to your point about the NCAA also in the final four that Friday night, [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5064.12s)]
*  I mean, those are the big games of consequence. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5068.200000000001s)]
*  Like how great is March band is on both the men's and women's side. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5070.36s)]
*  Those are the huge games of consequence. And we, that shorter season. So I, I, [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5073.5599999999995s)]
*  I would argue a lot of our games are games of consequence, [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5077.5199999999995s)]
*  even in the regular season. But then when we get into the playoffs, um, [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5080.12s)]
*  you're going to see a lot of competitive competition, [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5083.639999999999s)]
*  a lot of parity this year leading into our playoffs in September and October [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5086.36s)]
*  when we crown the champion. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5090.32s)]
*  So you have the players union, [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5092.4s)]
*  there's going to be a CBA that you're going to have to negotiate with them. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5094.96s)]
*  You have all this interest from all these people who either buying franchises [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5098.32s)]
*  already did and the prices have gone way up, [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5101.96s)]
*  but yet the business model hasn't been proven to be successful yet. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5104.8s)]
*  So you're still investing in it. It's still growing. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5108.8s)]
*  The attendance has gone way, way up the last couple of years. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5111.52s)]
*  You're in this new meteorites deal where I think you at least tripled where you [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5114.2s)]
*  were making before, [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5117.4800000000005s)]
*  but you're only still doing 44 games a year plus the playoffs. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5119.4s)]
*  Also you have what's the thing you had where people, [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5123.64s)]
*  people bought in, they bought percentages of the teams. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5127.72s)]
*  So you have like the syndicate that owns a piece of the league. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5130.4400000000005s)]
*  What is that? [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5134.88s)]
*  Yeah, just in the league, not teams. This was the thing I referred to in February [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5135.52s)]
*  of 22 because we had no capital to go hire people to affect a digital [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5138.56s)]
*  transformation, a higher social media, people, growth. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5143.04s)]
*  So what percentage was that? So, um, well, first of all, uh, [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5145.72s)]
*  half of our existing teams invested in it. Um, [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5149.200000000001s)]
*  so it was 16% altogether, [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5152.88s)]
*  but about 6% of that were existing investment investors like the size [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5154.48s)]
*  and the Seattle group and, um, Indiana, um, you know, [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5159.759999999999s)]
*  Washington, Ted Leonsis. Um, so, so, [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5164.679999999999s)]
*  so it was about 10% outside investors like Nike and Michael Dell and Condoleezza [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5167.919999999999s)]
*  Rice and Swin Cash and Paukasol and, um, Baron Davis. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5172.48s)]
*  So we opened it up to a broader group of diverse investors, [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5177.48s)]
*  Melody Hobbs and Gale King. Like we're really proud of what we did back then. Um, [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5181.28s)]
*  and, um, it served us well. I mean, we would not be where we are today, [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5186.08s)]
*  not even close without that capital and having deployed it against so many [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5190.0s)]
*  different things, including, um, you know, marketing, [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5194.32s)]
*  including we launched our first ever in season competition. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5197.2s)]
*  We have our commissioner's cup well before the NBA did it as a nice little, [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5200.32s)]
*  um, you know, trial run for the NBA's Emirates cup now. Uh, and again, [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5204.84s)]
*  we're just able to produce all of our preseason games. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5208.8s)]
*  We weren't able to do that before. Uh, [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5211.400000000001s)]
*  we just had this record breaking game between the Indiana fever and the [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5213.400000000001s)]
*  Brazilian national team, a preseason game that averaged 1.3 million viewers on [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5216.28s)]
*  ESPN. Um, and then our draft was the second most viewed ever. Um, [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5221.2s)]
*  the most viewed, um, compared to MLB and NHL in their history. So we're just, [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5225.88s)]
*  we're, [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5231.320000000001s)]
*  we're seeing the returns of that investment in a big way, uh, [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5231.56s)]
*  and the values of our teams going up. So that was, [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5235.12s)]
*  that capital raise, when you saw the people that came in and invested, [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5238.08s)]
*  I think gave confidence to all of our owners to invest in their teams, [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5241.6s)]
*  which is driving their team values up. So I think it's, you know, [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5244.88s)]
*  a bit of a confidence builder and you know, [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5248.360000000001s)]
*  capital and valuation is all about confidence in the business and what you're [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5251.2s)]
*  building here. And you know, to your question about the, [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5254.64s)]
*  or point about the media deal, um, we're not even done yet. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5257.6s)]
*  So that was our tranche one media deal, um, [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5260.68s)]
*  which actually was much more than triple, um, five to six, [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5263.52s)]
*  five to six times. Okay. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5268.24s)]
*  Yeah. So it's a, that was a 200 million AAV and we were going in with about 40, [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5269.4400000000005s)]
*  but well, by the time we're done with tranche two, [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5274.360000000001s)]
*  cause we still have plenty of inventory left to sell. Um, [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5276.56s)]
*  hopefully we're aiming to be about 260 AAV over, um, many years. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5279.72s)]
*  And that's the other thing when you, [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5284.320000000001s)]
*  when you get a big piece of your revenue locked in at a huge number, I mean, [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5285.64s)]
*  this is actually pretty historic or is historic, [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5290.04s)]
*  our largest media deal in the history of women's sports. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5293.04s)]
*  And as we know, and you know better than anybody, they'll, [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5296.28s)]
*  the landscape's changing so quickly. Streamers are interested in us. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5299.92s)]
*  They're interested in more year round content partnering with the NBA. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5303.84s)]
*  We can provide, [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5307.4400000000005s)]
*  we're the only two leagues that run counter that can provide over 320 days of [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5308.16s)]
*  live programming to a streamer. Um, [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5313.08s)]
*  and so it was much more attractive to a Disney and Amazon and NBC, [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5315.72s)]
*  you would pick up for the W to be, um, to, [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5320.0s)]
*  to be part of this historic deal. So, um, [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5323.56s)]
*  we're excited about that starts next year, next season, [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5327.88s)]
*  this year we're still under our old deals. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5330.6s)]
*  So you took that investment and it's almost like a, [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5332.76s)]
*  like a startup business that they were startup doing like around [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5335.92s)]
*  getting people to invest no different than if you had like a AI company or [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5341.320000000001s)]
*  something, people buy in, use that money, [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5345.22s)]
*  throw it back in the league and all these different ways. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5348.64s)]
*  And it actually paid off the part that, so it's funny, [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5351.04s)]
*  like this has come full circle almost where a lot of the good stuff that was [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5354.24s)]
*  happening for WNBA the first 20 years solely happened because of the relationship [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5359.48s)]
*  with the NBA and basically Stern pushing it and being like, [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5363.68s)]
*  you have to show the NBA, it has to be on TV, [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5366.84s)]
*  like basically forcing the networks to take it as part of the NBA package. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5369.28s)]
*  Now in this, in this last deal, I was watching from afar going, would they, [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5373.72s)]
*  would WNBA have been better off not being attached to the NBA at all? [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5378.48s)]
*  Would they have been better off being on their own, [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5382.5599999999995s)]
*  like doing their own thing just entirely? [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5384.679999999999s)]
*  It's a little bit of an unknown thing. We already had our own deals. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5388.0s)]
*  We already had Amazon. We've had Amazon. This will be our fourth year with Amazon. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5391.36s)]
*  We have Scripps, Ion, we have CBS. Those are three deals. The NBA doesn't have, [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5394.679999999999s)]
*  so everyone just assumes it's just the NBA deal. It's not. Um, but again, [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5398.839999999999s)]
*  the beauty of going to market, [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5402.879999999999s)]
*  at least for that first tranche of deals with the NBA is that 321 days of live [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5404.4s)]
*  program. We're the only two leagues that can do that here in the U S and, uh, [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5409.5199999999995s)]
*  it paid huge dividends because otherwise we're four and a half months season [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5413.4s)]
*  bill and it's not as interesting to a streamer who's on a subscription plan with [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5416.5199999999995s)]
*  their subscribers every month, right? But you need to provide year round content. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5420.36s)]
*  And that's why that was advantage. I mean, [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5424.92s)]
*  obviously the NBA has been a huge supporter for a long time under David who [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5427.08s)]
*  launched the league now, Adam, obviously. Um, [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5430.28s)]
*  and I sit on the NBA senior leadership team, which is helpful, you know, [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5433.32s)]
*  because we can play off one another and they've seen a huge now demand for the [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5436.719999999999s)]
*  WNBA game and are always really helpful. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5442.32s)]
*  We share some back office shared services, but again, we kind of, [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5445.4s)]
*  because of that capital race, [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5450.32s)]
*  been able to hire a lot of people on our own and have our own cell sellers on [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5451.4s)]
*  the, that side of things. But yeah, I mean, it's a huge advantage. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5455.12s)]
*  There's a reason why we're the longest tenured women's professional sports league [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5459.12s)]
*  ready to enter season 29. And it's because, you know, [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5462.52s)]
*  we've had a big brother all along. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5465.84s)]
*  Well, [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5467.92s)]
*  so how do you make sure you're not perceived as being too big yet? [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5468.080000000001s)]
*  Because the next step for this is like charter plans for every team. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5472.0s)]
*  Um, salary cap goes way up and things start happening financially that maybe [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5476.84s)]
*  don't capture where the league is economically. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5482.4800000000005s)]
*  So you're the one in charge of balancing that, [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5486.280000000001s)]
*  especially when you have a bunch of agents coming in, [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5488.080000000001s)]
*  you have players who expect to be paid certain way. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5490.36s)]
*  I've seen some of the quotes already from people who play for the league, [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5492.839999999999s)]
*  who rightly want as much money as they could possibly make. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5496.88s)]
*  And we want them to make as much money as they can make. But being in mind, [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5501.28s)]
*  the economic model we've been building. And I would say, you know, [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5505.44s)]
*  five, six years ago we were like an infant and you talked about it being viewed [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5509.24s)]
*  as a startup. We were like an infant in our economic model, not in the game, [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5512.599999999999s)]
*  our economic model. And now we like graduated to like a young adult. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5517.12s)]
*  We kind of skipped our teen years and our tween years and we graduated to a [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5520.8s)]
*  young adult, but we still have a lot of growth ahead of us. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5524.88s)]
*  And it's not just the media deal driving growth and that's going to drive [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5527.96s)]
*  significant increases in player pay. And, you know, last year, [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5531.200000000001s)]
*  we already did the charter program fully for all teams for the whole season of [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5533.92s)]
*  playoffs. We had been chipping away each year. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5538.56s)]
*  We did it initially for the finals and we did it for all playoffs, [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5541.360000000001s)]
*  commissioners cup. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5544.76s)]
*  And I felt because I knew kind of where we were trending on the media deal that [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5545.56s)]
*  we would pay it forward and give the players charter last year. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5549.6s)]
*  So everybody got charter last year because two years ago, that was a big, [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5554.320000000001s)]
*  that was a big catch. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5558.88s)]
*  We did it in between collective bargaining. So we did it because I felt very [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5559.96s)]
*  confident in the fact that we could get to 2026 and the new meteor rights [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5565.08s)]
*  deals. And I knew where we were trending, [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5570.0s)]
*  that we would essentially pay it forward and do it sooner than an expected [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5572.04s)]
*  bargaining cycle. So that's done. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5575.56s)]
*  Our corporate partners have stepped up in a huge way. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5577.76s)]
*  We just signed allied financial. They're going to do a rivals week. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5580.88s)]
*  They're going to innovate inside the partnership. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5584.56s)]
*  We have Google and Nike and Deloitte and AT&T and CarMax and so [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5586.280000000001s)]
*  many others and American express. So, I mean, we're in such good shape, [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5591.16s)]
*  but we still have a lot of low hanging fruit growth global. I mean, Bill, [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5594.88s)]
*  if you ask me what's next, Cathy, after expansion and all this, [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5598.360000000001s)]
*  and CPA it's global. I mean, there's, I mean, [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5601.84s)]
*  when I was at the state department a couple of years ago, they said like, [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5605.2s)]
*  one of the number one requests they get from embassies is for women, [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5608.08s)]
*  basketball players and the WNBA to come to those embassies and show young girls [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5611.76s)]
*  that they could be professional athletes and leaders in their communities. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5616.4400000000005s)]
*  So there's so much. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5619.76s)]
*  Could you see a world where there's almost like what they're talking about the [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5621.96s)]
*  NBA, where there's a European version of the league and there's some sort of [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5624.88s)]
*  you WNBA season happens, that season happens, [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5629.8s)]
*  and then there's like a world finals. Is that like in play down the road? [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5632.5599999999995s)]
*  Obviously kind of tested Canada as our first outside the U S. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5636.2s)]
*  We love to play preseason games around the world. That's part of our plan. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5640.4s)]
*  And whether that's in Europe, Asia, Africa, longer term, [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5644.84s)]
*  those cities on the list, [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5648.5599999999995s)]
*  there's a lot of cities that would like us to come and have an exhibition or a [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5650.2s)]
*  regular season game this year. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5654.48s)]
*  We're playing our first ever regular season game outside the U S. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5655.76s)]
*  And Vancouver, I know that might not sound like a big deal, [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5658.4800000000005s)]
*  but this is a regular season game that the Atlanta dream will actually host the [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5661.4800000000005s)]
*  Seattle storm up in Vancouver. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5664.6s)]
*  And we've seen new success selling out in Edmonton and Toronto on preseason [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5667.16s)]
*  games. So, so the sky's the limit globally. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5671.400000000001s)]
*  We just want to make sure we have the right global footprint first. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5674.96s)]
*  Nike just took Sabrina Inesco over to Asia. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5679.08s)]
*  She went to China and Hong Kong, I think the Philippines. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5682.4800000000005s)]
*  And so, you know, that kind of, you remember Bill, [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5686.04s)]
*  what happened with the NBA when they brought Kobe there and Stefan Marbury, [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5688.84s)]
*  and we built huge businesses and eight and huge followership in Asia. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5692.12s)]
*  And so I think we'll, you know, [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5697.4400000000005s)]
*  look at that playbook a little bit and make sure we're bringing our game to [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5699.92s)]
*  markets. I mean, [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5703.64s)]
*  we showed our games in India a couple of years ago and 24 million unique viewers [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5704.280000000001s)]
*  watched our games in India and we didn't have one player from India in the WNBA. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5708.360000000001s)]
*  So lots of upside globally for us. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5712.56s)]
*  So you have to figure out the CBA, what's the timeline for the next deal? [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5716.84s)]
*  The timeline is by the end of the year. So I feel really good. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5720.8s)]
*  We've already been having meetings. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5723.6s)]
*  I feel really good that we'll get something transformational done together. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5725.080000000001s)]
*  And you know, the players will posture in the media, but as I said, [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5728.200000000001s)]
*  on draft night, we're not going to negotiate in the media. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5731.6s)]
*  We're going to negotiate across the table and we're going to return as much as [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5733.88s)]
*  we possibly can with keeping in mind the financial viability of the league for [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5737.4400000000005s)]
*  many decades to come. And I think the players will want that too. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5741.16s)]
*  All right. So here's my big nitpick. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5745.2s)]
*  I hate that these games go against NFL on Sundays, like huge [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5747.5199999999995s)]
*  and I know we've, I know we've discussed it. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5752.88s)]
*  You know, I threw out that stat about the, [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5757.84s)]
*  about the Golden State Valkyries only having less than 5% of the fans that were [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5760.5599999999995s)]
*  season ticket holders that were Golden State Warrior fans. The actual, [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5764.84s)]
*  you know, look, the footprint is challenging. It's a Rubik's cubes, [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5769.76s)]
*  arena availability, broadcast windows. You got to do May, October. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5773.080000000001s)]
*  And I realized that goes into both the college football season. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5778.160000000001s)]
*  So we don't generally don't play on Saturdays and it goes into the NFL season for [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5780.72s)]
*  sure. Although we ironically kept a weird pickup and viewership on [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5784.76s)]
*  Sundays when we. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5789.400000000001s)]
*  So that was the counter. You guys actually did really well going against football. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5790.76s)]
*  It was like this almost like an alternative football audience that just crushed. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5795.120000000001s)]
*  If the one o'clock game, a lot of times we play at three o'clock Eastern, [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5799.200000000001s)]
*  the one o'clock games close to over by then, or the score or whatever, [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5802.320000000001s)]
*  people will turn on ABC or ESPN. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5805.76s)]
*  We do really well on ABC cause we have a more lifestyle viewer. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5808.88s)]
*  And I think our crossover, we get a lot of fan data. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5812.320000000001s)]
*  That was the one thing though, when I came in, we had no, I go, who's our fan? [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5814.64s)]
*  Everybody looked at me like, what? So now again, [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5817.72s)]
*  we have data analysts and data scientists and you know, [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5820.84s)]
*  fan acquisition and insight, [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5823.96s)]
*  like insight people who will take our fan data and give me insights off of that. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5826.16s)]
*  And one of the insights was, I think we only have 20% crossover with NFL [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5830.36s)]
*  fans. So only 20% of NFL fans are also WNBA fans. Now we would like more of them. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5835.36s)]
*  So we'll, we'll have our Taylor Swift someday, right? [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5840.4400000000005s)]
*  Because we skew a little more women than the men's leads do. And, and so, [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5843.64s)]
*  you know, I think we're working on ways to bring in more fans, [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5848.88s)]
*  whether it's from other men's professional sports or women's or whatever. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5853.24s)]
*  But that was an aha when I saw we're only 20%. Yeah. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5857.04s)]
*  It's like 60 some percent NBA fans are also WNBA fans. So, [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5859.76s)]
*  you know, so it's a much bigger percentage. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5864.64s)]
*  So not to compete against the NBA or college basketball is more important to me [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5866.68s)]
*  than to, I don't even view it as competing against the NFL because we have a [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5870.88s)]
*  whole different fan base. But we get a little lift on those Sundays when we play [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5874.2s)]
*  games. I know a lot of people don't think so, but we do. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5878.12s)]
*  Yeah. Well, it's the other challenge seems to be you, [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5880.92s)]
*  you're basically like the matriarch of this family and you want all the kids to [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5884.76s)]
*  get shine in all these different ways. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5888.8s)]
*  But then you've also stumbled into this phenomenon in Kaitlin. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5890.6s)]
*  That's like a once a decade thing. Like the last time it really happened in sports [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5893.76s)]
*  was probably Steph Curry in 2014, right? When the, [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5898.200000000001s)]
*  when the Warriors thing really started taking off and you could just feel the [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5902.160000000001s)]
*  energy shift. I remember going to a Warriors game the year that the year [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5905.88s)]
*  before the 73 win season and just get in there early. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5910.28s)]
*  Cause I want to see media people and there were people were in the arena just [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5913.4s)]
*  to in case he was still going to be there for warmups. I was like, ah, this is, [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5917.36s)]
*  this is like different. This has not happened for a while. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5921.679999999999s)]
*  You have this now with Kaitlin. So how, [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5925.92s)]
*  how do you balance pushing her versus like making sure like Asia Wilshen, [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5928.24s)]
*  her shoe just sold out in five minutes. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5933.08s)]
*  So it's not like some of the other players aren't doing well, [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5935.08s)]
*  but how do you balance making sure you're not just too focused on her and, [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5937.16s)]
*  but you also don't want to not focus on her. Not enough. You know what I mean? [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5941.04s)]
*  I know it is a balance, but she's a generational talent. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5945.48s)]
*  No league's ever about one player, [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5948.16s)]
*  but in this case Kaitlin brought tens of millions of new viewers into the W and [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5949.5599999999995s)]
*  there's no denying that impact. I'm not just in the WNBA, but the world of sports. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5953.16s)]
*  Adam and I took all this time about, yeah, she's the most popular athlete in [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5957.36s)]
*  America. You know, [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5960.64s)]
*  she went to an LPGA tournament for a pro AM on a Wednesday and it's like wrong [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5962.08s)]
*  people were out there to watch her. You know, [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5967.16s)]
*  I was at the masters last year when she was in the final four and you know, [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5969.4800000000005s)]
*  I counted like 19 Kaitlin Clark shirts of people walking around the masters. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5972.68s)]
*  So it's crazy. Like I said on a pod, [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5977.12s)]
*  I think she's the most popular under 30 team sport athlete we have now that my [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5980.04s)]
*  homes is 30, I think anyone under 30, [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5984.8s)]
*  I think she has anyone in any sport at this point, just from a recognizable. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5987.6s)]
*  This turned 23. So she is hugely popular. But again, [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5992.56s)]
*  you do want to balance it because obviously it's all that happened with you, [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5996.8s)]
*  Drew Watkins, you know, [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=5999.400000000001s)]
*  you want to balance make making sure that you're also promoting your other stars [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6001.4800000000005s)]
*  like in Asia Wilson. Yeah. Like a Brianna Stewart, [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6005.08s)]
*  Nafisa Collier killed it last year. I mean, [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6008.360000000001s)]
*  she was the runner up MVP and the defensive player of the year. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6011.16s)]
*  I thought she was awesome. Yeah. Great person. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6015.28s)]
*  She's gotten a couple of calls in the finals. I thought, [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6017.96s)]
*  I thought she could have gotten some superstar calls. So I was upset about that. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6020.08s)]
*  Mom and a role model for so many. So, um, yeah. So I, I think again, [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6023.08s)]
*  um, that's why this year's sustaining game, [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6028.76s)]
*  sustain the momentum we had last year and gain even new, new viewers. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6030.64s)]
*  Because if you look at, I mean, [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6034.32s)]
*  we're up triple digits in every category and every demographic and young people, [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6035.76s)]
*  old people, young girls and boys were having watch parties and watching our [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6039.88s)]
*  games. So it was incredible. So. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6043.48s)]
*  How's the gambling? If the gambling comes, that's when you really know when the, [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6045.36s)]
*  when they, cause I know like Fandel was saying, [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6049.16s)]
*  they actually had like real interest, especially as it went to the playoffs. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6052.4800000000005s)]
*  So that's like a whole other, a whole other, like that's what you know, [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6056.72s)]
*  you're doing. Okay. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6059.92s)]
*  There already is a lot of sports betting on the WCA and you know, [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6060.88s)]
*  one of the things last year on our tip off night happened to be a Tuesday night [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6065.72s)]
*  last year, not a Friday night because of the Olympic break. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6069.56s)]
*  And we had to push everything in, [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6071.72s)]
*  but we competed on ESPN two against the NHL Stanley Cup playoffs and outrated [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6073.84s)]
*  it. And Fandel said that Handel and the W was the highest in the month of May [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6079.84s)]
*  last year of any sports. So it was incredible. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6084.52s)]
*  So yeah, that that's another, [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6089.52s)]
*  like if you think about innovation about watching bet and bet and watch, [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6091.16s)]
*  and why do people watch sports? They watch for rivalries. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6094.52s)]
*  They watch for compelling content. And yeah, [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6097.28s)]
*  some of the sports bettors watch cause they bet the game. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6099.08s)]
*  Caitlin five plus threes with Indiana to win part of it. Yeah. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6101.400000000001s)]
*  That's just where we are with some sports viewership at this point. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6105.56s)]
*  But I know like I became an NFL fan cause I have five brothers and I started [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6109.32s)]
*  playing fantasy football. Right. And so I knew I had Tim Brown. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6112.92s)]
*  I'll never forget it. And you know, I had, this was way back. Um, and so that, [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6117.360000000001s)]
*  that caused me then to watch games. So same thing here. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6122.0s)]
*  I think more people are coming to watch the game from that, [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6125.12s)]
*  from that fan segment we call it. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6128.24s)]
*  So you're kind of stuck with your schedule now going May, October. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6130.24s)]
*  There's no way to go to 50 games. It's just too hard with the basketball. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6133.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, the problem is every other year we have an international competition. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6136.84s)]
*  So next year it'll be the FIBA world cup. Then two years after that, [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6141.12s)]
*  we have LA 28, which we love. I mean, the Olympics are, [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6144.32s)]
*  I mean the fact that the women won eight consecutive gold medals, [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6146.92s)]
*  the U S women's national basketball team, [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6150.92s)]
*  and they're going for their ninth all time record in LA is amazing. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6153.32s)]
*  So we have to support those international competitions. Yeah. I, [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6157.8s)]
*  I can definitely see us going to 50. I don't know what it's collectively bargained. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6161.6s)]
*  Right now the max is 44. Um, and you know, [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6165.16s)]
*  the question is do we want to go into November and cross over with the MBA and [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6168.16s)]
*  college basketball? And then, um, because there's not much to be, [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6172.36s)]
*  people don't understand. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6175.76s)]
*  There's not much you can do on the front end because, um, we, [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6176.44s)]
*  we love the college draft. We love the rookies. A lot of rookies. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6179.84s)]
*  Well, you're also, you have the college season ends April 4th. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6182.44s)]
*  Yeah, we can't start it much earlier. I mean, again, in a year like last year, [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6187.36s)]
*  like Caitlin gets goes to the final thing. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6191.6s)]
*  It's drafted the following Monday night as in training camp, [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6193.96s)]
*  the following Sunday. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6197.120000000001s)]
*  She was luggage for the first month of the season. Like that was pretty hard. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6198.96s)]
*  Since she was four years old or whatever. And they were great. So, um, so again, [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6203.08s)]
*  this year we had a little more time. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6207.320000000001s)]
*  We had like two and a half weeks between the draft and an opening of training [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6208.56s)]
*  camp. But, um, yeah, it's, it's a challenge on the front end. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6212.08s)]
*  You can't move it too much forward if you want the rookies to come in, [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6215.4400000000005s)]
*  which we do because it's a great, uh, [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6218.68s)]
*  it's a great theater system for us, as you said. And then, [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6220.88s)]
*  so we'll look at the backend and how far can we go and how many NFL and college [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6223.4800000000005s)]
*  football Saturdays gets, can we go into and we'll evaluate all that under, [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6228.080000000001s)]
*  uh, under the CBA. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6232.400000000001s)]
*  You know, it's interesting that WNBA is actually good for fantasy. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6233.92s)]
*  You just made me think of that when you were talking before about the football [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6236.72s)]
*  fantasy, because NBA fantasy stinks now because the season's too long and all [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6239.76s)]
*  the injuries and guys go and it's just like, there's no rhyme or reason to it. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6244.780000000001s)]
*  And I was like an original, I was playing fantasy basketball in the eighties. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6248.08s)]
*  WNBA is actually cause the shorter season, um, works better. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6252.16s)]
*  And that now you got my brains turning. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6256.72s)]
*  I'm gonna have to do. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6258.08s)]
*  ESPN does have a product. They have a fantasy league women's, uh, [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6258.92s)]
*  for the WNBA women's basketball, what's called. Yeah. So, um, [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6263.08s)]
*  they do have one just, I think the last two years or so. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6266.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. All right. Sounds like everything's going good. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6269.0s)]
*  Yeah, Bill. Five years for you. Four years, five years. What is it? [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6272.44s)]
*  Uh, it'll be six years in July. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6276.0s)]
*  So his first year was all blur cause it was COVID. Yeah. Yeah. Um, [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6278.08s)]
*  we forget COVID was like, right. Yeah. Right. Uh, you know, [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6282.28s)]
*  not that long ago, but seems like forever ago. So, uh, yeah, [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6285.5199999999995s)]
*  I feel like, so the first year really during COVID, [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6288.96s)]
*  that's when I handed Asia Wilson her first MVP and now three time MVP with her [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6291.48s)]
*  own shoe. Oh, the other thing Bill, [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6295.96s)]
*  that's been amazing to watch from where I sit is when I joined the league, [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6297.719999999999s)]
*  not one player had a significant endorsement, uh, with a big brand. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6301.36s)]
*  They, except for maybe their sneaker brand, but they weren't big. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6305.599999999999s)]
*  And now there's almost a commercial break in any major sport. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6308.2s)]
*  We are not seeing the WNBA player in the commercial spot. Um, [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6312.44s)]
*  it's pretty cool to watch whether it's car max, whether it's AT&T Delta. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6316.0s)]
*  Now on the seat back on a Delta plane, [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6319.96s)]
*  they filmed a commercial with three of our players, uh, [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6322.28s)]
*  Stewie and Neko Goumakai. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6325.28s)]

*  to support these players too individually. Like we have league deals with them, [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6331.72s)]
*  but we also have, uh, they also have personal endorsements now. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6336.04s)]
*  And so that's been a great part about the growth of the league. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6339.56s)]
*  And, um, I always said if 80% of every household consumer purchasing [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6342.400000000001s)]

*  why wouldn't you endorse a WNBA player? [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6349.88s)]
*  Well, they missed the boat with Tarasi cause she's the best. I do. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6352.88s)]
*  I can't believe they, she's the absolute best. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6356.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. She's the goat and she got voted the goat in our 25 year. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6360.0s)]
*  Cool. Like she's, she's a great hang. She's just cool. Like I don't, [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6362.84s)]

*  I know. And now I think God, if I was the commissioner 20 years ago, [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6367.72s)]
*  would it be different? Yeah. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6370.76s)]
*  She should have been more famous. I need a team this year. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6372.72s)]
*  Last year I had the links because I bet on them halfway through the season, [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6376.48s)]
*  almost almost pulled it off. But this year, cause you know, [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6379.96s)]
*  Boston doesn't have a team yet. Um, so I just look at, look at, [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6383.08s)]
*  look at Phoenix, look at Seattle, look at obviously Indy has really. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6387.48s)]
*  Yeah, I think I might bet. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6392.5199999999995s)]
*  I might bandwagon it and just bet on the fever to win the title. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6393.24s)]

*  Our free agency was a lot better this year than I thought, [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6404.72s)]
*  but next year fasten your seatbelt. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6407.28s)]
*  80% of the veterans in this week will be free agents. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6409.72s)]
*  And we'll run two expansion drafts. So one expansion draft, [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaJeKxHuIDY&t=6413.52s)]
