# Fixing the NBA All-Star Game With Van Lathan | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg)
*  We're gonna talk about NBA All-Star weekend, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=0.0s)]
*  your new favorite sport hockey. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3.24s)]
*  You're a true patriot now. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=4.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, the hockey got me. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=5.38s)]
*  It was a great watch. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=7.8s)]
*  It was very intense competition on Saturday night. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=9.0s)]
*  It was the three fights in nine seconds got you? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=11.68s)]
*  The three fights got me. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=13.88s)]
*  I missed the first two fights. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Me too. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=16.68s)]
*  I started getting emails after the second fight. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=17.52s)]
*  Right, and then I turned it on for the third fight. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=19.78s)]
*  But then, I watched two groups of players [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=22.2s)]
*  playing at the highest level [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=27.439999999999998s)]
*  who absolutely wanted to embarrass each other. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=28.64s)]
*  In an exhibition that meant nothing [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  that nobody even knew what it was. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=33.36s)]
*  No one cared. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=34.56s)]
*  No one cared. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=35.4s)]
*  No one cared in terms of outside of the world of hockey, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=36.24s)]
*  but they cared. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=41.24s)]
*  And the people in Montreal cared. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=43.04s)]
*  Do you hear how quiet it got [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=44.84s)]
*  the last five minutes of that game? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=45.96s)]
*  Yep, they were super quiet. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  They desponded. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=48.56s)]
*  I learned some stuff. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=50.4s)]
*  Now, what is it called now? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=52.2s)]
*  When a power play happens, okay? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  The power play. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=57.239999999999995s)]
*  And then after the power play, when they... [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=58.36s)]
*  Even when they become even sides. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=61.0s)]
*  When they become even sides, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=62.4s)]
*  is that called killing the penalty? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=64.0s)]
*  They've killed the penalty successfully. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=65.92s)]
*  They've successfully killed the penalty. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=67.6s)]
*  I've heard this term. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=69.16s)]
*  When they've successfully killed the penalty, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=70.56s)]
*  the excitement from the crowd, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=72.4s)]
*  because they didn't give up any goals during the power play. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=75.2s)]
*  I was on edge the whole time I'm watching the power play. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=79.2s)]
*  And I'm like, oh my God, are we gonna score? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=82.2s)]
*  You're getting roped in, I can feel it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=84.4s)]
*  I got roped in. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=85.64s)]
*  It's good. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=86.48s)]
*  Well, we're taping this before all the Monday games. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=87.32s)]
*  The Thursday finals gonna be in Boston, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=88.92s)]
*  USA against somebody, hopefully Canada, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=90.76s)]
*  because I can't wait to see USA versus Canada [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=92.84s)]
*  in Boston would be awesome. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=95.68s)]
*  But that's not why you're here. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  You're here for a few reasons. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=97.8s)]
*  We're gonna try to fix NBA All-Star weekend [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=99.6s)]
*  and decide whether it could even be fixed. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=101.92s)]
*  Is it a sunk cost? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=104.28s)]
*  You have a theory about, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=106.84s)]
*  well, do your expectations, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=108.56s)]
*  do your exploration theory. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=110.32s)]
*  Okay, so certain things culturally expire. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=113.19999999999999s)]
*  And- [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=115.96s)]
*  Game shows. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=116.88s)]
*  Game shows. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  For example, when I was growing up, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=119.83999999999999s)]
*  Gilligan's Island and all of these shows [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=123.19999999999999s)]
*  from the 60s and the 70s were still in reruns, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  but they were still in reruns prominently. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=128.88s)]
*  I still knew all of these characters. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=132.64s)]
*  I still was aware of all of this stuff. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=134.88s)]
*  And then one day it just gets to a point, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  nobody cares about Gilligan's Island anymore. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=139.92s)]
*  Nobody cares about Three's Company anymore. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=142.16s)]
*  These shows just evaporate. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  Cheers is like this, and yet Seinfeld lives on [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=147.48s)]
*  and Friends lives on, but then Family Ties didn't. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=151.16s)]
*  So you just kinda never know when it's gonna happen. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=154.88s)]
*  There's a bunch of buffer years there. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=156.68s)]
*  Seinfeld and Friends made it to DVD. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=161.23999999999998s)]
*  And because they made it to DVD, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=165.64s)]
*  DVD release, and everybody was like, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=168.23999999999998s)]
*  oh my God, it's coming out on DVD. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=169.88s)]
*  And they lived a little bit long in syndication [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=172.44s)]
*  on TBS and stuff. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=174.67999999999998s)]
*  They're these kids' version, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=176.6s)]
*  and this sounds really, really bad, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=178.92s)]
*  of Gilligan's Island, of these older shows. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=180.56s)]
*  I 100% agree. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=183.48s)]
*  So that's their, this is an old TV show [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=184.56s)]
*  to a kid now as friends at Seinfeld. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=187.76s)]
*  That's their old, it's an old TV show. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=189.76s)]
*  But yeah, so things just, they go, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=192.6s)]
*  and they never announce when they're leaving. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=194.2s)]
*  They never tell you, oh my God, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  this is the last year that this is gonna be relevant. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=197.56s)]
*  So it can happen. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=199.68s)]
*  And the question is, could it happen to, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=200.68s)]
*  the NBA won't ever culturally expire. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  Has it happened already to All-Star Weekend? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=206.0s)]
*  To the All-Star game. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=208.28s)]
*  Has it happened to All-Star Weekend? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=209.28s)]
*  Has that culturally expired? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=210.4s)]
*  So a lot of it has to do with [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=211.76s)]
*  how being a sports fan has changed [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=214.84s)]
*  from the late 70s to the early 2000s to now, right? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=217.0s)]
*  When I was a kid, the All-Star game was amazing [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=220.28s)]
*  because it was like George Gervin, David Thompson, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=222.88s)]
*  people like that were never on television. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=225.0s)]
*  So to have some of my favorite Celtics in a game [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=227.0s)]
*  with people like Walter Davis, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  it was like, I never got to see those guys play. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=231.83999999999997s)]
*  It really mattered. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=234.0s)]
*  That peaked in 87. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=235.23999999999998s)]
*  Best All-Star game we've ever had. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=237.2s)]
*  You remember that, right? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=238.92s)]
*  Orlando Blackman made the free throws [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=239.76s)]
*  with time expired to send it to overtime. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=241.6s)]
*  I have no recollection of this. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=243.72s)]
*  It's the best All-Star game by far. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=245.16s)]
*  I guarantee if you watched it, you'd have a great time. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=247.2s)]
*  Okay, cool. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=249.48s)]
*  Goes into overtime. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=250.32s)]
*  Tom Chambers becomes James Worthy during the game. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=251.14s)]
*  Magic's just feeding him. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=253.23999999999998s)]
*  Bird's in it, Jordan's in it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  Everybody's in it, it's amazing. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=256.04s)]
*  And I think the last good All-Star game was 2001. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=257.8s)]
*  Because I did a running diary of the 03 All-Star game, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=261.12s)]
*  which was Jordan's last one. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=264.40000000000003s)]
*  It went into overtime. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=265.56s)]
*  And if you just look at the basketball reference, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=266.48s)]
*  it's like, oh, that must've been a good game. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=268.08000000000004s)]
*  It wasn't. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=269.32000000000005s)]
*  01 was the last one, I think. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=270.16s)]
*  What's changed. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=272.48s)]
*  So I remember I got league pass in 2000 [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=273.96000000000004s)]
*  because I got a direct TV dish. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  I got to see all these guys constantly. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=278.32000000000005s)]
*  Social media comes in, the internet comes in. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=280.44s)]
*  It's just not special in the same way [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=284.44s)]
*  to see all these guys on a court. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=286.44s)]
*  So that's problem number one. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=288.15999999999997s)]
*  Is there anything you wanna add to that? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=290.8s)]
*  So funny, as much as we have in common [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=292.0s)]
*  the different lives that we've lost. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=294.84s)]
*  In 2000, I remember hiring somebody from the neighborhood [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=296.28s)]
*  so that I could steal cable. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=300.38s)]
*  And you were getting the direct TV. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=302.52s)]
*  Mine was more illegal, because I lived in an apartment [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=306.44s)]
*  and I wasn't supposed to have a direct TV dish. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=308.56s)]
*  And I had to lie and pretend I owned the house [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=310.24s)]
*  to get direct TV, because it was literally illegal [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=312.72s)]
*  to have it if you just rented. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=315.14000000000004s)]
*  The cable guy literally knocked on our door [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=316.54s)]
*  and was like, hey, I done taken it off again. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=318.76000000000005s)]
*  Don't have him come back. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=321.92s)]
*  I'm gonna have somebody come out here. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=323.04s)]
*  So yeah, here's the thing. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=325.44000000000005s)]
*  The last All-Star game might've been 2003. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=328.20000000000005s)]
*  I can understand that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=333.20000000000005s)]
*  That was MJ's last game. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=335.04s)]
*  He wasn't good in it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=336.12s)]
*  It went into overtime. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=337.20000000000005s)]
*  It wasn't a great game. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=338.20000000000005s)]
*  But was that MJ Kobe? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=339.08000000000004s)]
*  Kobe has a red jersey on [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=340.20000000000005s)]
*  and him and MJ are going back and forth. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=341.48s)]
*  It's kind of a thing. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=342.48s)]
*  Yeah, it had a couple moments. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=343.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=344.32s)]
*  However, the weekend endured for a little while longer [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=345.16s)]
*  because there were still such memorable moments [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=347.96000000000004s)]
*  from the weekend. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=349.76s)]
*  There was Blake Griffin jumping over to- [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=350.6s)]
*  Well, that was 10 years later. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=352.16s)]
*  Yeah, that was the last one. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=353.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  Right, and then there was one of the greatest spectacles [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=354.92s)]
*  we've ever seen from the All-Star game. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  The Aaron Gordon, Zach Levine dunk contest. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=359.86s)]
*  We're still having moments where there's still [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=363.16s)]
*  signs of life. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=365.56s)]
*  It's still kicking. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=366.42s)]
*  But it hasn't had a pulse now in a while. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=367.88s)]
*  There hasn't been anything to make you go. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=371.0s)]
*  As a matter of fact, the only thing I can think of [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=373.15999999999997s)]
*  was Steph Curry versus Sabrina, the shootout that they had. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=375.44s)]
*  And they didn't even do that this year. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=378.88s)]
*  Yeah, because you can't even- [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=380.4s)]
*  Mac McClung is fun, but I don't care about Mac McClung. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=381.23999999999995s)]
*  They might as well pull somebody from the stands. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=383.64s)]
*  He's not an actual NBA player. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=385.52s)]
*  He's like in the G League. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=387.09999999999997s)]
*  So at that point, just go get people from YouTube [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=388.78s)]
*  and have them dunk. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=391.2s)]
*  It's not like Mac McClung's playing NBA minutes. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=392.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=394.79999999999995s)]
*  You go against your own, huh? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=395.64s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=397.0s)]
*  Well, it was a big weekend for the whites. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=397.84s)]
*  It was a gigantic weekend for the whites. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=398.67999999999995s)]
*  Three point dunk hockey, but you became a hockey fan. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=401.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's huge. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=403.8s)]
*  SNL 50, one of the whitest TV events. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=404.64s)]
*  Yeah, they tried to make fun of it. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=407.16s)]
*  We know the truth though. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=408.56s)]
*  But so look, there's just no, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=410.48s)]
*  this used to be something to where you saw [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=413.2s)]
*  all these celebrities and all of these people there, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=415.52s)]
*  not because it was a corporate thing, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=418.62s)]
*  which is kind of how it feels now, right? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=420.12s)]
*  Kind of. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=421.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=424.28s)]
*  Now it feels like every time you see somebody famous, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=425.12s)]
*  they're at the Meta party or the Pringles event [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=427.96s)]
*  or the whatever. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=431.96s)]
*  It seemed like before that they just wanted to be there [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=433.3s)]
*  because it was the biggest party of the year or one of them. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=435.59999999999997s)]
*  Super Bowl weekend and other things like that. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=440.92s)]
*  Notwithstanding, but now it all feels forced. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=443.26s)]
*  None of it feels like fun. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=447.56s)]
*  None of it feels grounded in basketball culture [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=448.78s)]
*  in any actual way. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=451.5s)]
*  I actually went on Twitter and I asked [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=452.7s)]
*  what killed All Star weekend. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=454.64s)]
*  And the variety of answers was so wide, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=456.40000000000003s)]
*  but they were also all plausible, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=461.24s)]
*  which tells me that the NBA has not just one problem [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=464.28000000000003s)]
*  with All Star weekend, but several. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=467.2s)]
*  There's a player culture problem [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=469.0s)]
*  as far as how they view the All Star game. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=472.84000000000003s)]
*  There's a- [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=474.72s)]
*  Well, they don't wanna get embarrassed. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=475.56s)]
*  They don't wanna get embarrassed. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=476.38s)]
*  They don't wanna end up on Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=477.22s)]
*  you name it, because they got dunked on [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=479.88s)]
*  because they missed the three, anything. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=481.44s)]
*  Endless highlight feed type of situation, right? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=482.8s)]
*  There's a top-down NBA problem, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=484.92s)]
*  some people were saying, with Adam Silver. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=486.52000000000004s)]
*  There's the way we ingest culture, which is kind of- [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=488.32s)]
*  The enabler, Adam Silver? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=490.40000000000003s)]
*  The enabler, Adam Silver. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=491.52000000000004s)]
*  So there's all of these different issues [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=492.76s)]
*  that's going on with the All Star game. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=494.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, the three-pointers are the other big thing. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=495.28000000000003s)]
*  Three-pointer, and not one clear way to fix it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=497.04s)]
*  Not one clear way to say, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=501.5s)]
*  hey, this will bring the magic back to the weekend. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=503.88s)]
*  It's turned into the, so the game itself [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=506.72s)]
*  has turned into just a terrible pickup game [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=509.56s)]
*  with no defense. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=511.96000000000004s)]
*  Now, that's the way it used to be [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=512.96s)]
*  for two and a half, three quarters, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=515.24s)]
*  but the great thing about the All Star game [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=517.36s)]
*  was it would settle into being an awesome game, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=518.9200000000001s)]
*  and it was always a nice little snapshot [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=521.26s)]
*  of who mattered that season. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=523.82s)]
*  You would see the five guys on each side, East versus West. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=525.6s)]
*  You'd have a feel for, all right, these are the guys now. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=529.08s)]
*  This is it. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=532.14s)]
*  Everybody else got to play, now who are the 10 guys [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=533.08s)]
*  that really matter? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=535.48s)]
*  Once they started messing with the teams and doing, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=537.1600000000001s)]
*  the thing they did this weekend, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=539.6800000000001s)]
*  and I flagged it from the beginning, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=540.96s)]
*  the rising, the four teams, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=543.12s)]
*  and one of them's the rising star, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=544.96s)]
*  that's just stupidity. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=546.24s)]
*  It really is. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=547.88s)]
*  It's like, nobody wants to see Zach Eaddy [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=548.7s)]
*  and Stephon Kassel, all these dudes who I like, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=550.6s)]
*  but we don't want to see them on Sunday night. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=554.08s)]
*  This is like, this is where you promote [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=555.32s)]
*  the biggest stars you have. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=556.9000000000001s)]
*  There's nothing fun about watching these guys [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=558.72s)]
*  who have been barely in the league [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=560.84s)]
*  against like Steph Curry. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=562.12s)]
*  They're trying to make the All Stars play, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=563.88s)]
*  and they figure if they put the young guys out there, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=567.0400000000001s)]
*  they won't win. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=570.18s)]
*  It's backfired, LeBron didn't play. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=571.02s)]
*  LeBron's like, I'm good. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=572.14s)]
*  Do you think it's weird he just decided not to play [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=573.66s)]
*  five hours before the game? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=575.5s)]
*  It's incredibly weird. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=576.6999999999999s)]
*  It's just a rare loss for him, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=578.66s)]
*  because there's no way you're not taking a loss [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=580.5799999999999s)]
*  and taking shit for that, so why? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=583.26s)]
*  Everybody wants to see him. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=584.98s)]
*  Yeah, he's the biggest star in the league. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=587.1s)]
*  We don't have too many more All Star games to enjoy him. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=587.9399999999999s)]
*  So everybody wants to see him. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=590.6999999999999s)]
*  Everybody just wants to see him out there. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=592.4599999999999s)]
*  So, odd thing. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=595.42s)]
*  So, you know, as I tried to make myself watch it, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=597.36s)]
*  like I didn't try to make myself watch it. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=602.1600000000001s)]
*  Well, you love basketball, we should say, as do I. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=604.12s)]
*  Love basketball. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=605.96s)]
*  So I'm going to watch NBA players doing cool stuff. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=606.8000000000001s)]
*  Where the audience? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=609.88s)]
*  There just wasn't NBA players doing cool stuff. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=611.44s)]
*  That's what the All Star game is about. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=614.44s)]
*  It's about NBA players doing cool stuff, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=615.88s)]
*  even the dunk contest. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=619.4s)]
*  You have Mac McClung doing cool stuff. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=621.2s)]
*  He's kind of not an NBA player, though. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=624.2800000000001s)]
*  So it's still not NBA players doing cool stuff. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=627.68s)]
*  Yeah, the closest is Castle, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=631.68s)]
*  who is probably like the third or fourth best Spur. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=633.48s)]
*  And the Spurs have their five games under 500, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=636.48s)]
*  and he's a rookie. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=638.92s)]
*  And he was by far the biggest star in the slam dunk contest. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=639.92s)]
*  That's not good. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=642.28s)]
*  He should have won, baby. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=643.3199999999999s)]
*  He's pretty good. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=645.24s)]
*  He's pretty good. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=646.08s)]
*  But so, you know, it's tough, man. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=646.92s)]
*  Like, there was a clip going around [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=649.24s)]
*  of the Thompson brother from up there in Detroit. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=652.3199999999999s)]
*  Flying. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=657.12s)]
*  Did you see this clip? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=658.48s)]
*  Well, I mean, those guys are the best athletes [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=659.72s)]
*  probably in the league right now. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=661.2s)]
*  He flew from like the restricted area and dunked the ball. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=662.24s)]
*  It looked almost superhuman. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=667.8s)]
*  And I'm like, that kind of energy and stuff [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=670.16s)]
*  is what used to happen in the dunk contest. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=673.76s)]
*  It used to be one or two stars, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=675.28s)]
*  and then two or three, oh my God, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=678.24s)]
*  this guy's a crazy athlete guy. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=680.88s)]
*  And that mix of guys was enough to make that night electric. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=682.6s)]
*  And it's just gone. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=685.48s)]
*  And now we're hoping that they don't fail. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=687.04s)]
*  And it just doesn't feel the same anymore. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=689.52s)]
*  Can I give you a dunk idea? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=692.0799999999999s)]
*  I just thought of this as you were talking. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=693.84s)]
*  What about dunk battle? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=695.88s)]
*  Okay, what's this? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=697.4s)]
*  It's just one guy challenges another guy [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=698.6s)]
*  at All-Star Saturday, and it's just one-on-one. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=700.64s)]
*  So like the Thompson twins are like, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=703.4399999999999s)]
*  dunk contest, two of us, let's go. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=705.3199999999999s)]
*  And the dunk contest is just like four one-on-one [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=707.56s)]
*  just for pride battles. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=711.48s)]
*  Like, Giannis is like, you know what? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=712.72s)]
*  I'm tired of this Wemba-Nyama shit. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=714.56s)]
*  Let's go, dunk contest right now, you versus me. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=717.56s)]
*  I would love it. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=721.2399999999999s)]
*  My thing is I would wonder whether or not [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=722.1999999999999s)]
*  these guys could take the loss. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=724.2399999999999s)]
*  You know what I go back to? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=726.16s)]
*  Do you remember when LeBron was adamant [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=728.1999999999999s)]
*  about hiding the video of getting poked on at his camp [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=730.9599999999999s)]
*  when the Crawford kid- [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=735.8s)]
*  I don't remember that story. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=736.76s)]
*  Which Crawford kid was it? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=738.16s)]
*  Oh, it was- [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=739.7199999999999s)]
*  Jordan Crawford? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=740.56s)]
*  It was Jordan Crawford. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=741.4s)]
*  I vaguely remember it. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=742.2399999999999s)]
*  So, oh my God. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=743.2s)]
*  So Jordan Crawford dunks on LeBron at his camp. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=744.2800000000001s)]
*  And they hit the video. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=747.2800000000001s)]
*  They like, they deep shadow protocol, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=751.08s)]
*  midnight boys, pew pew, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=754.2800000000001s)]
*  they deep shadow protocol the video. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=755.9200000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=757.96s)]
*  And I just remember at that time thinking, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=758.8000000000001s)]
*  this has been made into such a big deal. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=763.72s)]
*  Getting dunked on is something that happens. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=767.0s)]
*  Anyone can dunk on anybody. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=768.6s)]
*  You get caught from behind, you get lobbed, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=770.1600000000001s)]
*  you get caught from the back door, whatever. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=773.76s)]
*  But to me, that vision of yourself as a player [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=775.64s)]
*  and yourself as an entity is the same reason [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=781.0s)]
*  why these guys can't let their hair down a little bit [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=783.88s)]
*  and have fun at an all-star game. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=787.16s)]
*  Cause at an all-star game, for it to be fun, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=788.88s)]
*  somebody has to kind of lose. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=792.4799999999999s)]
*  It's competition, it's fun. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=795.36s)]
*  Somebody's gonna lose a three-point contest. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=797.16s)]
*  Remember Allen Iverson goes out there [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=799.0799999999999s)]
*  and he's got the worst performances [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=801.04s)]
*  in the three-point contest that we've ever seen. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=802.04s)]
*  He laughs about it. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=805.16s)]
*  He goes, maybe I should have practiced a little bit more. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=806.88s)]
*  Now with what you're gonna take on Twitter [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=809.7199999999999s)]
*  and how these guys are looked at, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=812.48s)]
*  nobody wants to be that guy. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=813.88s)]
*  That's AI, that's one of the greatest ever [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=815.24s)]
*  who went out there and wasn't a three-point shooter [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=817.56s)]
*  and ended up with 10 and laughed. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=820.36s)]
*  He laughed about it. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=822.56s)]
*  So I just think they take themselves [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=823.92s)]
*  a little bit too seriously. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=825.24s)]
*  We take ourselves as fans [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=826.16s)]
*  a little bit too seriously as well. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=828.0s)]
*  It's the pastime to complain about All-Star Weekend. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=829.88s)]
*  It's been 20 years of it. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=832.36s)]
*  This was especially bad though [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=833.64s)]
*  because it was so over the top overproduced. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=835.0400000000001s)]
*  I just want to see basketball. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=841.0400000000001s)]
*  I don't need to see, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=842.72s)]
*  I don't need games to stop for a half hour. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=844.08s)]
*  We don't need to honor the TNT guys forever. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=846.1600000000001s)]
*  We don't need all these different, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=849.0s)]
*  we don't need like a slam dunk. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=850.48s)]
*  Let's remember Vince Carter in 2001, whatever that was. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=852.72s)]
*  And we've got to do that for 10 minutes. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=856.12s)]
*  And then he comes out and has to talk to the crowd. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=857.7199999999999s)]
*  I don't know who that's for. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=860.5999999999999s)]
*  It's not for you and I, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=862.9599999999999s)]
*  but it's also not for teenagers. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=864.68s)]
*  It's not for eight-year-olds. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=867.56s)]
*  I honestly don't know. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=868.8399999999999s)]
*  People just want to see three-pointers [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=870.12s)]
*  and dunks and a good game. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=871.7199999999999s)]
*  Just go back to that. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=873.56s)]
*  Can I ask you this? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=874.8399999999999s)]
*  Is it possible that the basketball nerds have a hand [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=876.12s)]
*  in having ruined the All-Star game as well? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=879.5999999999999s)]
*  In what way? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=881.4399999999999s)]
*  So with the three-pointers or something else? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=882.28s)]
*  You and I talk a lot about the differing style [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=885.4s)]
*  of basketball that we like. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=889.3199999999999s)]
*  I like seeing a motherfucker get dunked on. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=891.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=893.76s)]
*  I don't not like that. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=894.6s)]
*  I get it. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=896.04s)]
*  I think the league misses a Blake Griffin. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=896.88s)]
*  I think the league misses a Deandre Jordan at his height. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=900.1999999999999s)]
*  I think the league misses some good old power basketball [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=904.68s)]
*  to get people up out of their seats. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=908.0799999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=910.0s)]
*  I think the fact that we don't have as much of that anymore [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=911.0s)]
*  doesn't really translate to the All-Star game being good [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=915.72s)]
*  because what the All-Star game then looks like [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=920.4s)]
*  is a regular season NBA game where they're shooting [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=923.16s)]
*  so many threes. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=925.52s)]
*  But when you have the best players on earth [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=926.68s)]
*  all on the same court, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=930.2s)]
*  you kind of don't want to see them do that. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=931.28s)]
*  What you want to see them do is kind of dominate each other. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=933.44s)]
*  You want to see them get into each other. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=936.96s)]
*  You want to see all the different styles of basketball [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=939.32s)]
*  that they play clash. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=942.24s)]
*  The old All-Star game was fun [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=943.72s)]
*  because it would be in a situation [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=945.5600000000001s)]
*  where you had the best players [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=947.8000000000001s)]
*  and everybody would have their little one-on-one thing. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=948.8000000000001s)]
*  It would be like, okay, this guy's going to go against this guy. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=950.84s)]
*  Luke Cage. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=952.88s)]
*  And KG is going to go against Tim Duncan. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=953.72s)]
*  Then Karl Malone is going to go against Charles Barkley. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=956.2s)]
*  You're going to get all of that stuff. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=958.5200000000001s)]
*  But that's not how they play the game anymore anyway. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=959.6800000000001s)]
*  So you're really not going to get that in the All-Star game. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=963.0400000000001s)]
*  That was one of the most famous All-Star games ever. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=965.32s)]
*  It was 1977. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=967.7600000000001s)]
*  The year after the merger. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=969.24s)]
*  Dr. J's first NBA All-Star game. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=970.36s)]
*  Now is when he... [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=973.2s)]
*  I can't remember if he dunked on Kareem or Bill Walton. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=975.48s)]
*  It was one of them. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=977.84s)]
*  It was one of his most famous dunks. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=978.6800000000001s)]
*  But he Tomahawked through it down. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=980.24s)]
*  He was just awesome in the game in general. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=982.32s)]
*  It really meant something. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=984.12s)]
*  It was cool to have all these guys in one game. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=985.4000000000001s)]
*  And that faded out by the time Jordan retired the first time. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=988.24s)]
*  To me, there's two issues. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=992.0400000000001s)]
*  One is the competitiveness. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=993.24s)]
*  And two is the style. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=995.5200000000001s)]
*  And I think you can fix both. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=997.64s)]
*  And I'm going to have a fix for you that I'm going to throw. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1000.4s)]
*  Alright, Van, it's time. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1002.72s)]
*  We're fixing the All-Star game. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1003.56s)]
*  And this is the best I've ever felt about a fix. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1004.92s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1007.52s)]
*  And I actually really feel like I have it. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1009.4s)]
*  Saturday. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1013.3199999999999s)]
*  Slam dunk. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1015.52s)]
*  And then the first All-Star game. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1017.4399999999999s)]
*  And then Sunday. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1019.04s)]
*  Three pointer in the second All-Star game. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1020.04s)]
*  I'm going to explain. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1021.96s)]
*  We need the All-Star week and have coherence again. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1023.96s)]
*  It needs to be East versus West. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1026.88s)]
*  We also need stakes. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1029.04s)]
*  And the whole thing about home court advantage for the finals [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1030.88s)]
*  should go to which conference wins. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1035.1200000000001s)]
*  You can't really do that when you have all these guys [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1037.28s)]
*  who could give a shit about... [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1039.8400000000001s)]
*  Trey Young's not... [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1041.6000000000001s)]
*  Just wait. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1042.56s)]
*  I have a fix. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1043.1200000000001s)]
*  Trey Young's not going to care if the East wins [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1044.48s)]
*  because he's not going to be in the finals. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1046.56s)]
*  You know? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1048.28s)]
*  So if you make home court the prize, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1050.12s)]
*  you go to a 40-minute game, go FIBA rules, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1053.24s)]
*  so it moves faster and feels different. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1055.84s)]
*  And you have eight man teams from the East and the West. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1058.6s)]
*  So we pick 24 All-Stars total, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1061.6399999999999s)]
*  but only 16 of them play in the big game on Sunday [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1065.56s)]
*  with the home court advantage at stakes. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1067.96s)]
*  Here's the catch. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1069.8799999999999s)]
*  Only players from top five seeds can be in the All-Star game. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1071.8s)]
*  Oh. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1075.6399999999999s)]
*  So everyone who's in the Sunday game [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1077.04s)]
*  is actually going to care about home court advantage. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1080.48s)]
*  So I have it seven on each side [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1082.96s)]
*  plus an eighth person who's a commissioner pick. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1085.44s)]
*  So eight versus... [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1088.4s)]
*  We start everything at 7 p.m. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1089.52s)]
*  We have the three-pointer, three-point contest, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1091.6s)]
*  first round of it, first half of the game, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1094.24s)]
*  three-point contest at halftime, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1097.68s)]
*  and then the second half of the game. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1100.24s)]
*  And here's what the teams would be. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1102.0s)]
*  So we would have... [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1104.96s)]
*  So the West, these are all top five seeds. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1109.4399999999998s)]
*  Yokage, Jaren Jackson, LeBron, SGA, and Harden as the starters. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1113.9199999999998s)]
*  Jalen Williams and Shen Gun coming off the bench, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1119.84s)]
*  and Curry as your exemption pick. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1122.32s)]
*  So that's eight. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1124.8s)]
*  East, Tatum Towns, Yannis Brunson, Mitchell, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1126.08s)]
*  Mobley and Jalen Brown, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1129.52s)]
*  and then the exemption pick would be Cade Cunningham. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1131.04s)]
*  And we're just fucking going for it. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1133.76s)]
*  Whoever wins gets home court advantage. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1134.9599999999998s)]
*  Everybody who's in that game is actually going to care. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1136.9599999999998s)]
*  We might get a game seven at home if we win this. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1140.2399999999998s)]
*  So then you move to the other thing, the Saturday game. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1143.6s)]
*  You take the remaining All-Stars. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1146.8799999999999s)]
*  There's Wemby, Siakam, Trey Young, Garland, Dame, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1148.3999999999999s)]
*  Anthony Edwards, AD, and Hero. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1152.08s)]
*  And you have them play the eight best future guys. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1154.4799999999998s)]
*  Castle, the Thomsons, the first second year guys. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1156.8799999999999s)]
*  They play those guys. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1159.84s)]
*  Two million dollar prize, 250k per person if you win. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1161.12s)]
*  Eight V8, same thing, 40 minute games. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1164.6399999999999s)]
*  And you have the slam dunk after it. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1167.04s)]
*  So that game is the Sunday game or the Saturday? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1168.56s)]
*  That's the Saturday game. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1170.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1171.28s)]
*  So that's Saturday game, slam dunk. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1171.76s)]
*  That's Saturday. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1174.8799999999999s)]
*  Sunday is three point. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1175.9199999999998s)]
*  And then this home court advantage finals game [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1177.36s)]
*  with all the top five, all the best players in the league [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1179.36s)]
*  with actual stakes. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1181.6799999999998s)]
*  So I like it. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1182.9599999999998s)]
*  So here's the deal. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1183.76s)]
*  You still have the Rising Stars game. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1184.56s)]
*  Do you have the Rising Stars game? [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1186.7199999999998s)]
*  I don't have the Rising Stars game anymore. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1187.76s)]
*  I have the eight best Rising Stars against the eight remaining [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1190.1599999999999s)]
*  All-Stars who weren't top five seeds. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1192.8799999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1195.04s)]
*  Then we would have to change how we pick the All-Star game [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1195.28s)]
*  a little bit. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1197.28s)]
*  So we'd have to have at least seven from the top five seeds [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1198.24s)]
*  to be in this game. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1201.6799999999998s)]
*  What happens when you get a vet in the consolation against [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1202.56s)]
*  the Rising Stars game who doesn't want to be there? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1208.56s)]
*  Then guess what? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1210.9599999999998s)]
*  You don't get to fucking play in the All-Star game anymore. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1211.9199999999998s)]
*  That's the other thing with this. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1214.7199999999998s)]
*  That's my next wrinkle. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1216.24s)]
*  What you're going to have is... [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1217.12s)]
*  What you're going to have is... [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1217.84s)]
*  That's my next wrinkle. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1218.1599999999999s)]
*  Oh, the game's not good enough for you? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1218.96s)]
*  Don't fucking come next year. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1220.64s)]
*  You're not eligible. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1221.8400000000001s)]
*  That's it. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1223.28s)]
*  Adam Silver, the enabler. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1224.88s)]
*  Let's start hitting people with a ruler. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1226.24s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1228.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1229.04s)]
*  So the Lakers are the five seed this year, right? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1229.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1231.2s)]
*  So they make it. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1231.3600000000001s)]
*  But in the past, you might be looking at a situation [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1232.0s)]
*  where you had a team with LeBron who was in the playing. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1235.1200000000001s)]
*  LeBron, you're playing on Saturday night or next year. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1239.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1243.3600000000001s)]
*  Or next year, you're not in the game. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1243.92s)]
*  This is it. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1245.76s)]
*  Once you diss us with this weekend, you're out. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1247.28s)]
*  You don't get to play for home court advantage after that. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1249.6799999999998s)]
*  Let's put real pressure on these dudes. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1253.12s)]
*  It's like this is an honor and a privilege to be in this game. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1254.8s)]
*  How much leverage do you feel like the league has to do that? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1257.36s)]
*  I'm asking. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1261.04s)]
*  Seriously. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1261.6799999999998s)]
*  Well, this is an Adam Silver question. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1263.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1264.72s)]
*  Because Stern would have been able to do it. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1265.04s)]
*  Adam wants to be everybody's buddy. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1267.6s)]
*  That's the difference. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1270.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1271.28s)]
*  Because... [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1272.32s)]
*  So again, I'm going to read you the teams. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1274.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1275.52s)]
*  Go for it. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1275.76s)]
*  East. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1276.72s)]
*  Tatum, Townes, Giannis, Brunson, Mitchell, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1277.44s)]
*  Mobley, Jalen Brown, and then Cade Cunningham is the exemption pick. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1280.16s)]
*  Versus Yokich, Jaren Jackson, LeBron, SGA Harden, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1283.76s)]
*  Jalen Williams and Shungoo and Curry is the pick. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1287.44s)]
*  8v8. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1290.16s)]
*  40-minute games. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1292.08s)]
*  Three subs. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1293.76s)]
*  That's it. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1294.4s)]
*  Everyone's playing. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1294.8799999999999s)]
*  We're fucking going. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1295.76s)]
*  Home court advantage for the finals at stake. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1296.56s)]
*  I'm watching that. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1298.64s)]
*  I'm watching it too. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1299.44s)]
*  In your revamped All-Star game, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1301.68s)]
*  is Victor Wimby-Nyaman... [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1304.32s)]
*  He's playing on Saturday in this one. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1306.1599999999999s)]
*  But it's like, guess what, Victor? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1307.6s)]
*  Still a privilege to be here. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1309.12s)]
*  Go whoop on all these future stars. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1310.8799999999999s)]
*  And by the way, next year, get a top five seed [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1312.72s)]
*  so you can be in the Sunday game. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1315.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1317.28s)]
*  Because then it would lead to some top five seed jockeying. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1317.9199999999998s)]
*  It's like, oh shit, there's a week to go [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1321.12s)]
*  until they pick the All-Star. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1322.6399999999999s)]
*  We got to get in there. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1323.76s)]
*  Well, it would also lead to something [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1324.56s)]
*  that I think the All-Star weekend needs [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1327.2s)]
*  is stakes and hierarchy. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1331.12s)]
*  Because if you're a top five type of guy, right, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1333.12s)]
*  and you're playing in that game, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1336.56s)]
*  not only are you an All-Star, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1338.32s)]
*  but you're almost like a more all star-y All-Star [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1339.76s)]
*  because you're playing on a team that's competitive. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1343.76s)]
*  You've grabbed a carrot, which is, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1346.6399999999999s)]
*  I play for a top five team, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1349.1999999999998s)]
*  so I am in our biggest profile game. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1351.12s)]
*  Here's the other thing I forgot to mention. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1352.7199999999998s)]
*  This is what they lose with the stupid, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1355.12s)]
*  oh, guys from different teams. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1357.04s)]
*  And you have Jaylen Brunson playing against Towns. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1358.56s)]
*  Like, I like when teammates are on an All-Star team together. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1361.76s)]
*  Like this team I laid out, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1364.8s)]
*  Tatum and Brown get to play together. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1366.08s)]
*  Mobley and Mitchell get to play together. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1368.64s)]
*  And then Brunson and Towns gets to play together. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1371.2s)]
*  And that's like an advantage in a game like this, right? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1373.2s)]
*  You have SGA and Jaylen Williams get to play together. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1375.92s)]
*  And once again, those guys are playing harder [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1379.8400000000001s)]
*  because they're incentivized because they- [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1381.68s)]
*  Yeah, and it's like, hey, it's crunch time, man. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1383.76s)]
*  We're the two seed. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1385.68s)]
*  This could be like a game seven in the finals. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1386.96s)]
*  But everybody who would be in that game, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1388.88s)]
*  including LeBron on the Lakers, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1390.4s)]
*  has at least a puncher's chance to play in the finals. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1393.0400000000002s)]
*  And then you go down to the runner-up dudes like, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1395.6000000000001s)]
*  Wemby, sorry. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1399.2800000000002s)]
*  You're not a top five seed yet. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1402.5600000000002s)]
*  You don't get to be in the Sunday game. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1403.8400000000001s)]
*  Here's the thing- [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1405.2800000000002s)]
*  Work your way up there, buddy. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1406.24s)]
*  I get it. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1407.3600000000001s)]
*  So these are the only two things that are going to stop [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1408.16s)]
*  the idea from really shining. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1411.52s)]
*  Number one is the NBA is going to want to [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1412.96s)]
*  promote guys like Wemby, whether he's on a winning team or not. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1416.32s)]
*  Saturday night. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1420.3999999999999s)]
*  Huge audience right after the slam dunk. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1421.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1423.4399999999998s)]
*  And number two, I guarantee you, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1424.1599999999999s)]
*  you get pushed back from a surly vet, from a Steph, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1427.6s)]
*  from a guy like that who happens to play on a team [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1431.04s)]
*  that's not contending right now. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1433.52s)]
*  250 grand. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1435.2s)]
*  Your team wins. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1439.2s)]
*  You get 250k. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1439.84s)]
*  So that's your carrot. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1441.12s)]
*  And then your stick is you can't play in the game next year. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1442.3999999999999s)]
*  You would really be that draconian about- [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1446.32s)]
*  I would. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1448.32s)]
*  I think they have to be that. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1449.6s)]
*  But do you think it's that important- [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1450.6399999999999s)]
*  It's not like you're taking money from these dudes. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1451.6s)]
*  You're just saying like, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1453.36s)]
*  look, man, you didn't give a shit about this weekend. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1455.04s)]
*  So we don't want to have you back. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1457.52s)]
*  It's a privilege to be here. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1459.6s)]
*  You're representing the league. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1460.8s)]
*  We're trying to build new fans. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1461.9199999999998s)]
*  Because the other thing with this, if I did that Sunday thing, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1463.9199999999998s)]
*  I would start that at seven o'clock. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1466.48s)]
*  I want kids to watch it. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1469.28s)]
*  I want kids to be up at 10 o'clock. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1470.3999999999999s)]
*  You want something a little- [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1472.08s)]
*  So you're seven o'clock Eastern. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1473.04s)]
*  Seven o'clock Eastern. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1474.1599999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1474.8799999999999s)]
*  I want kids to watch it. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1475.6s)]
*  The way they started last night, you had kids, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1477.12s)]
*  it was almost 11 o'clock at night. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1478.9599999999998s)]
*  And there's some stupid thing and they're playing to 40. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1481.52s)]
*  It's just like, what are we doing? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1486.1599999999999s)]
*  How important to the NBA is All-Star Weekend in your estimation? [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1488.24s)]
*  I can't tell because I know they make a lot of money from it. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1494.6399999999999s)]
*  It's a corporate event. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1497.9199999999998s)]
*  That's what they do. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1499.52s)]
*  If it were up to me, it would be two nights. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1501.12s)]
*  That's it. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1502.6399999999999s)]
*  I think it's too many nights. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1503.4399999999998s)]
*  I think this break is like right now there's no sports. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1504.56s)]
*  We're taping this on a Monday. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1507.6s)]
*  If this hockey thing wasn't happening, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1509.36s)]
*  there'd be nothing happening right now other than college basketball [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1511.04s)]
*  and people put out mock drafts. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1513.76s)]
*  Spring training is coming back. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1516.24s)]
*  Spring training is coming back. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1517.52s)]
*  I saw the new Red Sox double play combo. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1519.44s)]
*  I got a little excited about it. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1521.2s)]
*  We got Bregman. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1522.24s)]
*  No, I think they need to some sort of juice [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1524.24s)]
*  or really seriously think about not doing it anymore. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1528.96s)]
*  Those would be my two options at this point. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1531.9199999999998s)]
*  Because here's the thing. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1534.72s)]
*  It's bad for the league. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1535.36s)]
*  It's bad to have a bad weekend where every type of fan you have is like, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1536.48s)]
*  that sucked. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1540.32s)]
*  I didn't like it. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1540.8s)]
*  It's particularly bad this year where everyone was talking about the death of the NBA, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1541.36s)]
*  the whole ratings discussion, the conversation over the product on the court. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1547.6s)]
*  It was particularly bad this year for them to have a dud of All-Star Weekend. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1552.3999999999999s)]
*  They needed to have a good All-Star Weekend. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1557.9199999999998s)]
*  You have Draymond too on the announcing team just killing it. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1561.2s)]
*  That's part of it. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1565.2800000000002s)]
*  That's part of the criticism. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1566.0s)]
*  Part of the criticism is about guys like Draymond who are in those positions, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1567.44s)]
*  who criticize the product of the league. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1571.8400000000001s)]
*  You hear a lot of people talking about the inside NBA guys and all of that. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1573.44s)]
*  I don't know how real that is. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1577.3600000000001s)]
*  I do know that I personally enjoy not being baby. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1578.96s)]
*  I want to hear what people that are that invested into basketball culture [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1583.92s)]
*  actually think about basketball so it doesn't bother me. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1589.68s)]
*  I can't see how Draymond shitting on that idea to have the younger guys on Sunday night, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1592.8s)]
*  how that puts a preconceived notion in people's mind that those guys shouldn't be there on Sunday. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1598.8s)]
*  So two things. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1604.5600000000002s)]
*  One, he was right. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1605.3600000000001s)]
*  I give him credit for saying it. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1606.88s)]
*  Two, you don't want somebody who's on TV when it's this thing you're trying to push [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1608.8s)]
*  and sell to your fans just shitting on it, which I think is a real problem for them because [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1613.68s)]
*  football doesn't let football people do that. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1618.0s)]
*  When the football guys are out there, everything is very like, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1621.92s)]
*  let's go to so and so who talked to Pat Mahomes and it's like this glowy glossy [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1625.28s)]
*  light set and Mahomes says nothing for three minutes. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1630.64s)]
*  They throw it back and Gronk's talking about what a great guy is and it's just how they do football. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1633.36s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1638.8s)]
*  I kind of like it. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1639.68s)]
*  I don't want to see critical shit when I'm about to watch a game. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1641.28s)]
*  What about something that our friend Charlamagne the God said? [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1644.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1648.0s)]
*  That the game is just suffering from it being too close to the Super Bowl, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1648.88s)]
*  it being too close to so many other gigantic. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1654.8s)]
*  I was at the Super Bowl in New Orleans that there is no possible way that I was going to be able to [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1658.48s)]
*  make myself get up and go to an All-Star game with all those. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1667.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1670.24s)]
*  Four days later. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1670.48s)]
*  Four days later. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1671.28s)]
*  You would go if it was a good event. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1672.0s)]
*  You would go if it was like East versus West with finals home court at stake and [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1673.6s)]
*  people actually giving a shit like I've been at All-Star games when people gave a shit. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1678.0s)]
*  And maybe it was just for a fourth quarter. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1682.8s)]
*  It's fucking cool. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1684.32s)]
*  It was one of my favorite things that as the super as the NFL season kind of [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1685.12s)]
*  stretches out a little bit that they have to figure out how a way to kind of move their [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1690.48s)]
*  game away from the Super Bowl a little bit or else it's in the halo and the glow of the Super [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1696.48s)]
*  Bowl and the Grammys. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1700.72s)]
*  I mean, the real way to do it is that that dead week between conference championship games and [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1702.4s)]
*  Super Bowl where they could maybe do it then. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1707.28s)]
*  But that's also a good week for basketball because that's the one week people kind of [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1710.48s)]
*  drift toward watching games night after night after night. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1714.0s)]
*  The question to me is like, do they care? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1718.24s)]
*  And they claim they do. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1720.24s)]
*  It also feels like who's deciding this because whoever decided the structure of [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1721.44s)]
*  this last weekend, I don't understand it. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1728.4s)]
*  It's not like an entertainment person. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1731.6000000000001s)]
*  It's not somebody who can look at basketball objectively. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1733.52s)]
*  So who is it? [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1737.6000000000001s)]
*  Is it like the owners? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1738.4s)]
*  Like who? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1739.52s)]
*  I wonder who's spearheading this. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1741.0400000000002s)]
*  Well, when you look at the things that they try to do, to me, it always looks like they're [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1742.64s)]
*  trying to appease the players, which I get. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1748.24s)]
*  They're a league that is run essentially by their players. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1751.3600000000001s)]
*  The players have a lot of power in the NBA. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1755.1200000000001s)]
*  They're the face of the league. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1757.52s)]
*  The league pushes them in a way that a lot of other leagues don't push their players. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1758.96s)]
*  But it seems as if they're afraid to make the players step out of their comfort zones [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1762.8s)]
*  because at this point, forget about everything else in the All-Star game. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1768.24s)]
*  Forget about the game. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1773.12s)]
*  Forget about all this stuff. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1773.6s)]
*  We just honed in on the dunk contest. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1774.56s)]
*  The dunk contest used to be such an electric event, like even more so than the game for me. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1777.68s)]
*  Such an electric. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1785.2s)]
*  And then 20 years ago, it started a shift and then they would have a couple good ones, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1786.96s)]
*  but people forget the bad ones. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1791.36s)]
*  This is another thing. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1795.12s)]
*  If there's a decade span and you get three good dunk contest events. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1796.96s)]
*  You go one out of every three. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1803.04s)]
*  One out of every three. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1804.56s)]
*  We can actually find that. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1806.8s)]
*  That's a win for you. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1807.6799999999998s)]
*  That's a win. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1808.72s)]
*  The years that Nate Robinson won, they weren't spectacular, but they were memorable. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1810.0s)]
*  And then if you get something that you can actually, they were. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1815.68s)]
*  I remember leaving the stadium for a couple of those being like, never again. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1818.64s)]
*  I'm never going again. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1822.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1824.0s)]
*  So I'm saying is. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1824.24s)]
*  Dwight Howard. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1825.2s)]
*  But Dwight Howard, that was great stuff though. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1826.4s)]
*  Was it? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1828.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1829.68s)]
*  You weren't into that? [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1830.24s)]
*  I don't like watching centers dunk in the dunk contest. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1831.04s)]
*  Oh, but he was some kind of different type of situation. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1833.28s)]
*  Should Wimby be in the dunk contest? [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1837.52s)]
*  Like how tall do we go? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1839.04s)]
*  Wimby, but Wimby wasn't going to be able to get to the point. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1840.16s)]
*  Dwight was still short enough to where he could take flight. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1842.96s)]
*  Remember the Superman dunk? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1845.2s)]
*  He threw the ball in there. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1846.4s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1847.44s)]
*  It was nuts. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1848.32s)]
*  Have I told you my, nobody should be allowed to use props in the dunk contest rule? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1849.28s)]
*  I feel like I'm going to hear it now. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1854.56s)]
*  Well, just like what the fuck is a car doing on the court? [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1855.76s)]
*  And also we've already seen it. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1858.48s)]
*  Like, come on. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1860.0800000000002s)]
*  But I mean, in a lot of dunk contests, people jump. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1861.2s)]
*  Is a human a prop? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1863.3600000000001s)]
*  Could you not jump over a person? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1864.24s)]
*  I think that's about it. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1866.72s)]
*  But I think the human has to be facing you like they're a defender. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1867.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1870.8s)]
*  Let's make it look at least a little like basketball. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1871.2s)]
*  So what I'm saying is something as, and look, there's even cultural conversations around [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1873.36s)]
*  the dunk contest. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1880.24s)]
*  Like I can watch on Instagram right now, like Jordan Klingon and One Foot God and the [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1880.9599999999998s)]
*  Residues dudes that I watch on the internet dunk and do dunks that are so fucking filthy. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1889.4399999999998s)]
*  Bring them on Saturday. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1896.3999999999999s)]
*  Now, that's an interesting thing to me. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1898.6399999999999s)]
*  I always thought. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1900.9599999999998s)]
*  What's the difference between them and Mac McComb? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1901.4399999999998s)]
*  He doesn't fucking play. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1903.12s)]
*  I know. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1904.08s)]
*  But my thing is I would make the NBA guys dunk against them. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1904.3999999999999s)]
*  I would say, hey, the NBA guys, if you want to, there's guys out there and there's all [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1910.2399999999998s)]
*  they're doing is dunking. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1915.04s)]
*  All these guys are doing is dunking. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1916.4799999999998s)]
*  They're just dunking. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1918.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1919.4399999999998s)]
*  But there's a guy, he's like a seventh grade teacher or something like that. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1920.2399999999998s)]
*  He's like a DJ Clark or something. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1924.32s)]
*  I think his name. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1926.4799999999998s)]
*  All he, all they do is dunk. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1927.52s)]
*  I would make, I would have a dunk contest with those guys. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1929.36s)]
*  And then make the NBA guys dunk against them. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1932.64s)]
*  Because when the white boy, Jordan Klingon or whatever his name is, gets out there and [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1935.92s)]
*  starts shining on Saturday night. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1939.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1941.2s)]
*  They're not going to want to be embarrassed. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1941.68s)]
*  I will put some stakes on it. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1943.28s)]
*  I either want real stars or just find me the best dunkers, the three point shooters, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1945.2s)]
*  whatever. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1951.6s)]
*  I think they made a huge mistake not putting a couple of WNBA players in the three point [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1952.16s)]
*  contest. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1956.08s)]
*  I just think, I think people like the WNBA. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1956.48s)]
*  Like Caitlin should have been in the three point contest. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1959.44s)]
*  Just period. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1961.28s)]
*  And I would have had an Esquiu, like I would have had at least two WNBA players and I would [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1962.56s)]
*  have made the three point contest longer. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1966.64s)]
*  And I think it would have been more interesting. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1968.08s)]
*  They own the WNBA. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1970.08s)]
*  It's not like it would be like this crazy, you know, it's basically like what NBC used [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1971.52s)]
*  to do in the nineties where they'd be like, now the Friends stars are going on ER. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1976.88s)]
*  You know, and they do those crossover shows. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1981.44s)]
*  Like just fucking bring Caitlin. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1983.76s)]
*  Why can't she be at All-Star Weekend? [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1985.44s)]
*  I've been to it. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1987.28s)]
*  She's the biggest under 30 star in either sport. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1988.0s)]
*  In basketball, like it like I, I think that's kind of an Obama era idea. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1990.8s)]
*  I don't think, you know, that's going to people are going to be down for that. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1995.68s)]
*  Now that's going to start a real, real, real, real dialogue. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=1998.6399999999999s)]
*  I know where you're going. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2004.1599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2005.12s)]
*  Counter. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2006.6399999999999s)]
*  Are you turning the channel? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2007.84s)]
*  That's where we have to go back to with all this stuff is are you turning the channel? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2009.12s)]
*  It's like Andre Jackson from the Bucks is dunking. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2012.96s)]
*  I'm pretty sure I can go get a tea right now and maybe come back for a Mac McClung [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2016.32s)]
*  trying to jump over at Kia. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2020.64s)]
*  But if it's like three point contest and Tyler Hero just went and now here comes Caitlin Clark, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2022.48s)]
*  I'm fucking watching. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2028.16s)]
*  I'm not turning the channel for that. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2029.1200000000001s)]
*  So as much as we're talking about it, is it just over? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2030.88s)]
*  I don't think it's over. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2038.72s)]
*  I think there's real fixes. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2039.5200000000002s)]
*  Is it, is it just over? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2040.72s)]
*  Because if it wasn't over, this is like, it's kind of like the, the, uh, the married couple [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2042.0800000000002s)]
*  that goes to their counseling for 20 years. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2050.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2053.28s)]
*  They broke up, got back together, got an apartment. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2053.76s)]
*  And now they're trying BDSM. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2056.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2061.2000000000003s)]
*  To kind of figure out their relationship. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2062.4s)]
*  But really what they need is to go out and just date somebody else. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2064.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2069.36s)]
*  Like, so you think the All-Star Weekend's at BDSM stage. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2069.92s)]
*  I think some of this stuff is really getting into having tea parties. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2072.48s)]
*  This is why I'm telling Adam Silver's gotta dress up like a dominatrix and make these [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2075.04s)]
*  motherfuckers play hard again. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2078.88s)]
*  I mean, seriously, um, I don't think it's that dire because I think if you have stakes [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2081.2000000000003s)]
*  and you have stars, you can still win with a basketball sporting event. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2086.56s)]
*  And here to bring it full circle to the hockey, we just watched all these Canadian USA dudes [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2089.92s)]
*  really give a shit. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2094.96s)]
*  It wasn't just the three fights. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2095.84s)]
*  That game was really, that was like a game seven. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2097.6800000000003s)]
*  It was physical. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2100.0s)]
*  Like McEvoy had that awesome check on McDavid. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2100.96s)]
*  Like nobody hits McDavid like that. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2103.6s)]
*  They were flying. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2105.44s)]
*  They really cared. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2107.12s)]
*  So you can't tell me that these guys in the NBA, you can't pull that out. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2108.88s)]
*  They're playing for something though. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2113.92s)]
*  So I get what you're saying. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2115.36s)]
*  We know it's there. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2117.12s)]
*  You got to pull it out. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2117.92s)]
*  I know. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2118.72s)]
*  They're... [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2119.12s)]
*  Well, wow. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2123.2s)]
*  They're playing for something in that. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2127.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2129.2s)]
*  I don't mind your idea. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2130.64s)]
*  I don't mind your idea because it would be interesting for me. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2131.92s)]
*  This is the thing. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2135.6s)]
*  A lot of these things that we're talking about, they make the game interesting for me. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2136.88s)]
*  And that's important for you. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2141.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2143.2000000000003s)]
*  That's important. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2143.52s)]
*  Well, I would really care if the Celtics had a chance to get home court in the finals [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2144.48s)]
*  because they won this All-Star game. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2148.0s)]
*  Certainly. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2149.28s)]
*  Now I'm watching that with like Celtics friends. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2149.6800000000003s)]
*  What are you doing to make it interesting for them? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2151.92s)]
*  For the players. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2154.8s)]
*  Got to be money. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2155.44s)]
*  Home court matters. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2156.1600000000003s)]
*  Home court matters for the top five seeds. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2157.52s)]
*  That's a real thing. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2159.2000000000003s)]
*  And then for everybody else, money. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2160.4s)]
*  Throw money at it. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2162.1600000000003s)]
*  Throw some money at it. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2162.96s)]
*  It worked for NBA Cup. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2163.76s)]
*  They threw money at NBA Cup. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2164.88s)]
*  The guys that played kind of gave a shit about it. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2166.96s)]
*  They wanted to get out there and play. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2169.92s)]
*  I mean, look, think about it, man. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2171.04s)]
*  If you win $250,000, I mean, that's one- [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2172.7999999999997s)]
*  It's not nothing. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2177.8399999999997s)]
*  Donate that to somebody. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2178.64s)]
*  One night at Onyx for James Harden. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2179.6s)]
*  I mean, that's a Tuesday at Onyx for Harden. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2182.64s)]
*  That's great. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2187.2799999999997s)]
*  It's fantastic. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2187.8399999999997s)]
*  It's a big win for him. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2188.24s)]
*  So look, I remember baseball in the past. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2189.2799999999997s)]
*  I remember them, if I'm correct, they went to [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2194.8799999999997s)]
*  doing home field advantage for the All-Star game for a while. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2199.6s)]
*  Now, they stopped after a while, though, didn't they? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2203.04s)]
*  But it had the problem that we're trying to fix with this. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2205.2s)]
*  You have guys in the game who don't care [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2207.44s)]
*  because they're not going to make the World Series. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2209.2s)]
*  So what do they care about, you know, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2211.8399999999997s)]
*  where Game 7 in the World Series is? [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2214.64s)]
*  In this case, if you had all the top five seeds, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2216.16s)]
*  they're going to care. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2218.8799999999997s)]
*  Kendrick versus Drake. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2219.8399999999997s)]
*  Day 280. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2223.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2225.52s)]
*  It's like the Iranian hostage crisis. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2225.8399999999997s)]
*  Day 310. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2227.52s)]
*  Still going. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2229.2s)]
*  Kendrick's having like- [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2229.68s)]
*  This is like driven Kendrick to like A++ levels. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2230.9599999999996s)]
*  He's just dominating coming off Super Bowl show. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2234.3199999999997s)]
*  Drake still seems like he's interested in continuing the beef. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2237.3599999999997s)]
*  He's like keeps coming out of his corner. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2240.64s)]
*  The trainer's like, no, no, no, I'm going to throw the towel. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2242.56s)]
*  I said, one more round, one more round. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2245.2799999999997s)]
*  Is this the last rap beef ever for you? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2248.3999999999996s)]
*  No, no. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2251.6s)]
*  The last huge one? [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2252.8799999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2254.16s)]
*  So this is just going to keep happening? [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2255.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2256.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2256.8799999999997s)]
*  There'll always be one. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2257.68s)]
*  There's just not enough room on the mountaintop for everyone. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2258.9599999999996s)]
*  There'll always be one. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2261.2s)]
*  The moment that rap beefs in, there's no more hip hop. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2263.2s)]
*  So we need- [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2268.08s)]
*  It's fundamentally we need this in the D-day. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2268.64s)]
*  Fundamentally you have to have it. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2270.08s)]
*  Fundamentally you have to have- [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2271.12s)]
*  Like I hope everybody's paying attention right now [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2273.04s)]
*  to like what Kanye West is doing. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2274.8799999999997s)]
*  Kanye West like made it like he had all of these philosophical reasons for hating Drake. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2276.7999999999997s)]
*  During that whole time back in the day when me and Kanye were, you know, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2287.2799999999997s)]
*  going back and forth or whatever, when we went back to the team, he actually emailed Kanye. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2290.64s)]
*  And then he emailed me back and he went through this whole rant and in the middle of the rant, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2294.24s)]
*  he just mentioned Drake for no reason. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2299.52s)]
*  This is 2018. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2300.9599999999996s)]
*  Just missing Drake for no reason. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2302.56s)]
*  It's like because the radio was playing Drake, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2303.7599999999998s)]
*  Drake ain't talking about nothing. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2305.3599999999997s)]
*  I was like, this guy must really not like Drake. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2306.32s)]
*  But really the reality of it was that the only reason why he had a problem with Drake [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2308.0s)]
*  is because Drake was on top. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2312.2400000000002s)]
*  Because Drake was threatening him. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2314.0800000000004s)]
*  And now you see Kanye- [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2315.44s)]
*  That's why most rap beefs happen. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2316.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2318.2400000000002s)]
*  Kanye's sniffing around a little bit and he's acting like he wants it with Kendrick now. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2318.8s)]
*  So there's always going to be that one- [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2324.88s)]
*  That's like, he's like the crazy guy in the street who's just yelling outside somebody's window. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2326.4s)]
*  But there's always going to be this competitive thing in hip hop, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2330.88s)]
*  just like there is in sports to where some guy's going to want to take with some other guy. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2334.8s)]
*  Well, the reason I ask why is this going to be the last big one is because Drake lost it [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2337.84s)]
*  so decidedly. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2342.0s)]
*  I wonder if it becomes like NBA All-Star weekend where it becomes not worth it. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2342.8s)]
*  The risk reward thing is almost too great because Drake would be this casually everyone look back at. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2347.6000000000004s)]
*  Other people think he's just going to go away for four months, come back and be fine. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2353.04s)]
*  Well, the problem with that is that you're never going to- [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2357.1200000000003s)]
*  The rap beef you don't have as much control over, right? [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2361.2000000000003s)]
*  Because somebody can decide that they're going to diss you for any reason. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2363.52s)]
*  And once they do, you almost got to say something. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2366.88s)]
*  Well, if you're on equal footing. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2370.96s)]
*  If you're on equal footing. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2372.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2373.12s)]
*  Sometimes if you're not on equal footing, sometimes you can let it slide. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2373.44s)]
*  Some guys don't choose to let it slide. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2376.32s)]
*  With this one, it's particularly interesting because I'm starting to think that this rap [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2378.08s)]
*  beef is going to do irreparable harm to hip hop. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2383.92s)]
*  Okay, explain. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2387.68s)]
*  This is tearing rap apart. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2388.8s)]
*  Like, it's one thing to- [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2391.92s)]
*  If you have- If you take any of the other beats, right? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2395.6s)]
*  If you take Jay-Z and Nas, if you take Big and Pac, if you take- [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2397.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, Big and Pac both died. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2402.4s)]
*  Yeah, but not because of no rap beef. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2403.8399999999997s)]
*  That was over some- [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2405.12s)]
*  No, but- [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2405.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2406.3199999999997s)]
*  But it- [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2406.96s)]
*  Tied together somehow. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2407.68s)]
*  Yeah, it was like just messing around, but that was really over some other shit. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2408.72s)]
*  Y'all can go to VladTV.com if y'all want to- [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2413.2799999999997s)]
*  He got the whole scoop on that. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2416.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2417.6s)]
*  Like, I got the whole scoop. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2417.68s)]
*  But this has become such a flag planting by each side that the seriousness of the allegations- [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2418.88s)]
*  And there's always been serious allegations and like, you know, somehow verbally and all [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2433.36s)]
*  of this stuff, but right now, it like says something about you if you're a Drake fan. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2438.48s)]
*  It says something about you if you're a Kendrick fan. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2445.12s)]
*  And it's like, it's this weird hip hop version of the Democrats and the Republicans [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2448.56s)]
*  and the division that we see politically and culturally like in America, like in music. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2454.88s)]
*  And that just means that everybody can't party together. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2460.4s)]
*  And you have Kendrick who's actually saying, it's time to let the party die. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2463.92s)]
*  And then you got the girls that's going, well, we still want to shake our asses. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2468.3199999999997s)]
*  Is it okay if we shake our ass? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2472.72s)]
*  And then we don't really know if it's okay. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2474.24s)]
*  Is it okay if we don't care about some of the social causes and issues that Kendrick cares about? [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2476.64s)]
*  And I personally don't, I think you should care, but there's always been a part of hip hop that [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2482.3999999999996s)]
*  was just about the fun. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2486.3199999999997s)]
*  This is casting people in such distinct roles and it's so vicious. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2487.8399999999997s)]
*  Maybe I'm getting older. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2491.8399999999997s)]
*  I could be getting older, but this one is so particularly vicious with the fans going at it [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2492.64s)]
*  and really trying to sabotage each other that it feels like it's time for everybody to take [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2498.0s)]
*  their foot off the gas a little bit. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2502.8s)]
*  Just like relax. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2504.32s)]
*  The internet in full bloom we've never had for one of these, the way we have the internet [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2505.2000000000003s)]
*  and the shape it's in in 2025. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2510.0800000000004s)]
*  Particularly this post Elon, every no holds barred version of Twitter. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2512.0800000000004s)]
*  No holds barred internet in every respect. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2519.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2523.6800000000003s)]
*  And you can go as personal as you want. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2524.32s)]
*  You can do AI stuff now. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2526.32s)]
*  There's all these different ways you can make the other side look bad. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2528.0800000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2530.4s)]
*  And so like right now it's getting to the point to where, okay, so Drake dropped. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2530.6400000000003s)]
*  It came out. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2535.1200000000003s)]
*  It was very successful for them. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2535.92s)]
*  Wasn't my favorite music in the world. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2537.6000000000004s)]
*  The one Friday? [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2539.36s)]
*  The one that just came out, sexy songs for you, Drake and P&D. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2540.2400000000002s)]
*  Wasn't my favorite music in the world. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2543.44s)]
*  However, you could listen to that and tell that somebody gonna like it. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2545.28s)]
*  And it doesn't mean that you have, it doesn't make you a bad person or [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2549.2000000000003s)]
*  a, it doesn't make you an asshole if you like Drake. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2555.52s)]
*  And it doesn't make you righteous if you like Kendrick. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2560.72s)]
*  Like they're, they're both two entertainers that, that represent and do different things. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2565.2799999999997s)]
*  And while I probably gravitate a little bit more towards, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2570.72s)]
*  but not don't probably gravitate a little bit more towards what Kendrick does. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2574.7999999999997s)]
*  I think he's a very important, very important artist with really something to say. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2579.68s)]
*  Really represents something. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2583.36s)]
*  I like a lot of Drake records and I've always have liked Drake and I've always liked listening [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2585.04s)]
*  to him. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2588.48s)]
*  So I just think it's being taken a little too far now, a little too far. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2588.7200000000003s)]
*  Now take your foot off the gas a little bit. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2592.08s)]
*  My son, Ben Simmons, not the Clippers, Ben Simmons. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2593.6800000000003s)]
*  He says it's over Drake's dad. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2596.08s)]
*  Nobody cares. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2597.52s)]
*  That's his 17 year old LA take. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2598.8s)]
*  I'll be honest with you. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2600.48s)]
*  Drake was beaten in this as decisively as I've seen any rapper ever beaten in any music. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2603.04s)]
*  Was it like a form in Frasier? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2608.6400000000003s)]
*  Wasn't a form in Frasier because that joint was two rounds, but I would say it was. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2613.44s)]
*  Pacquiao Marquez four. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2620.96s)]
*  See not it's not Mayweather Gotti because Mayweather Gotti was, you know, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2624.48s)]
*  Ali Cleveland Williams. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2630.1600000000003s)]
*  Oh hell no. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2631.76s)]
*  If you guys ever want to see a killing machine, go watch Ali versus Cleveland Williams. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2633.28s)]
*  No, you know what it could be? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2640.1600000000003s)]
*  It could be a Hagler-Herns. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2642.0s)]
*  I'll tell you why. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2646.24s)]
*  So it's a short fight. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2647.6s)]
*  Longer than three rounds though. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2648.16s)]
*  Longer than three rounds. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2650.64s)]
*  A short fight. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2651.7599999999998s)]
*  With a lot of action. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2652.96s)]
*  With a lot of action. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2653.84s)]
*  However, at the end of it, Hagler brutalized him. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2655.04s)]
*  One of the greatest boxing photos ever. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2660.48s)]
*  Hagler like this with his hands up and in the back you can see [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2664.16s)]
*  herns being like carried back to his corner. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2667.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2669.52s)]
*  Fucking classic. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2670.08s)]
*  Yeah Hagler brutalized. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2670.96s)]
*  At the end of it, it was clear. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2672.56s)]
*  They both went crazy, but it was clear, very clear and decisive who the tough motherfucker [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2674.8s)]
*  that was. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2680.6400000000003s)]
*  Do you give Massachusetts credit for Hagler or no? [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2680.7200000000003s)]
*  I thought, oh well yeah, Brockton right? [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2683.2000000000003s)]
*  Brockton. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2685.36s)]
*  Half hour from Boston. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2685.92s)]
*  Brockton is from Boston or Brockton? [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2686.96s)]
*  So is that Boston? [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2689.04s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2690.1600000000003s)]
*  Well that's why I was so mad because he grew up black in Boston so he had to beat that. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2690.6400000000003s)]
*  Why did I open myself up to that? [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2696.64s)]
*  Why did I do that? [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2699.52s)]
*  That's why he was so pissed off. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2700.3199999999997s)]
*  That's why he was beating people up like that. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2702.08s)]
*  That's why he had to do it. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2703.6s)]
*  That was the hardest fight for me because Sugar Ray was my guy, but Hagler was basically [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2704.96s)]
*  a Boston team. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2709.2799999999997s)]
*  So I picked Sugar Ray because Sugar Ray was my favorite from like the 76 Olympics on. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2711.12s)]
*  Sugar Ray won the fight. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2715.84s)]
*  He won the fight. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2716.88s)]
*  I thought he did. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2718.24s)]
*  It's one of the great arguments though. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2718.96s)]
*  He eat it out. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2720.48s)]
*  There's other people who are like passionately convinced Hagler won and they get really mad [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2721.2799999999997s)]
*  if you bring it up. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2725.36s)]
*  I just think he was sloppy and wasn't landing and he was off balance the whole fight. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2726.08s)]
*  I didn't think he fought a good fight. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2731.28s)]
*  This is going to sound so crazy and people wonder about these obsessions I've had. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2732.56s)]
*  I've watched two different broadcasts of the fight. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2737.76s)]
*  I've watched the broadcasts. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2740.96s)]
*  I'm not surprised to see me blinking. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2741.52s)]
*  And then I've watched the fight with the sound off as well. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2743.1200000000003s)]
*  Sound off is important because the crowd was really behind Leonard. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2749.2000000000003s)]
*  And the announcers too. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2751.84s)]
*  He made a couple tactical mistakes but I was doing all of that stuff for a podcast. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2754.64s)]
*  But he made a couple tactical mistakes. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2758.48s)]
*  He came out, I think Hagler came out orthodox and he was a softball. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2761.2s)]
*  He tried to box with Leonard a little bit. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2766.24s)]
*  He made some mistakes in the fight. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2768.08s)]
*  I do think that had there been a rematch that Hagler would have fucking destroyed Leonard. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2769.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, he went to Italy. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2775.04s)]
*  There was no rematch. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2775.92s)]
*  He couldn't. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2776.72s)]
*  Hagler wasn't the same after the Mugabe fight. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2777.68s)]
*  He was kind of, he had a lot of boxing miles on him at that point. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2779.68s)]
*  Wasn't the same going into the Mugabe fight either. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2782.48s)]
*  Early 80s Hagler against that version of Leonard, he knocks him out. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2785.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2789.52s)]
*  I mean, once again, this is Leonard at middleweight. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2789.76s)]
*  Leonard had come up from 47. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2791.92s)]
*  But he was smart. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2793.36s)]
*  He planned out. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2794.56s)]
*  He would steal the last 20 seconds of rounds. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2795.28s)]
*  He really figured out how to win a scorecard against Marvin Hagler. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2798.0s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2803.2s)]
*  Anyway, but look, I get it. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2803.76s)]
*  Drake lost the rap beef. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2807.2s)]
*  It's over. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2809.36s)]
*  You lost decidedly. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2810.4s)]
*  Yeah, but what do you do after you've decidedly lost the biggest rap beef, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2812.88s)]
*  at least in the last 10 years, right? [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2820.0s)]
*  Oh, this might be the biggest rap beef. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2821.76s)]
*  Last 12 years? [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2822.88s)]
*  It's certainly the biggest rap beef of 12 years. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2824.96s)]
*  21st century? [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2826.6400000000003s)]
*  I could make an argument and look, you'd have to get 9th Wonder. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2829.52s)]
*  You'd have to get Sway. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2832.56s)]
*  You'd have to get Ebro Charlemagne. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2834.1600000000003s)]
*  All of those guys that live and breathe hip hop. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2837.36s)]
*  I could make an argument this is the biggest rap beef ever. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2840.8s)]
*  I could make an argument this is the biggest one ever. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2846.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it's tied to the generations too much, though. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2849.04s)]
*  Why would you? [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2851.92s)]
*  It's almost like arguing about different areas of basketball. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2852.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, the only reason why I say it is because Biggie Tupac was like, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2855.52s)]
*  the whole art form was still evolving as that was happening. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2859.92s)]
*  It was so tied into this incredibly influential decade. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2863.84s)]
*  I get it. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2868.32s)]
*  I was there for that one too. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2869.6s)]
*  And here we're already set. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2870.7999999999997s)]
*  Music is music is what it is. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2872.64s)]
*  Everybody's figured out their versions of that. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2874.3999999999996s)]
*  So it's almost amazing that it got to this point. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2876.16s)]
*  I didn't think it was possible anymore. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2879.8399999999997s)]
*  But that's what makes it different to me. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2880.96s)]
*  So Big and Pot come out and remember, there was also some personal stuff [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2882.64s)]
*  that was going on in that beef as well. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2886.48s)]
*  There's some here too, but not quite as much. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2888.24s)]
*  This seems to be different to me because it's almost more akin to Jay and Nas [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2890.7999999999997s)]
*  because this is the culmination of an entire generation of hip hop work. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2898.4s)]
*  You have two guys that come out roughly around the same time. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2905.36s)]
*  Drake beats Kendrick by two or three years as far as on the national scene. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2908.48s)]
*  And then for a decade, a decade plus, they dance around each other. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2912.4s)]
*  They poke at each other. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2919.84s)]
*  There's disses on records. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2921.6s)]
*  There's references on records. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2923.92s)]
*  There's interviews. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2926.32s)]
*  There's all of this stuff. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2927.36s)]
*  But these two guys along with Cole are recognized as the two biggest stars of their era. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2928.88s)]
*  These are the two biggest guys in their era. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2937.92s)]
*  And then they essentially fight or spar or battle for the kingdom of that era. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2940.08s)]
*  They battle to decide who's music and who's more influential, who matters more. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2948.8s)]
*  And there's so much behind it. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2955.04s)]
*  You're talking 10 years of work. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2957.52s)]
*  You're talking two different outlooks on hip hop. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2959.92s)]
*  Two completely perfect foils. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2963.6s)]
*  Even down to the fact that one guy represents this long legacy of hip hop that comes from [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2965.92s)]
*  Southern California from Compton. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2973.36s)]
*  Think about all of the Compton artists. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2975.52s)]
*  Post-OJLA. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2977.52s)]
*  All of that stuff, right? [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2978.56s)]
*  And then you have one guy who is an upstart coming from with a new style of hip hop. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2979.84s)]
*  The grassy high zone Drake. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2985.92s)]
*  Grassy. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2987.5200000000004s)]
*  All of that stuff, but still has roots in Memphis. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2988.6400000000003s)]
*  It's almost like it was, and I don't want to overstate it. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2992.1600000000003s)]
*  It wasn't just a hip hop battle. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2996.0s)]
*  It was a cultural litmus test in a way, which is another reason why I think people are taking [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=2998.0s)]
*  it so, so seriously. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3003.92s)]
*  It was like a battle to what the truth of hip hop and hip hop culture is. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3005.44s)]
*  So it was very, very, very high stakes. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3011.6800000000003s)]
*  And the song that won was obviously a song that accused Drake of a lot of things. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3014.48s)]
*  But the one thing that it accused Drake of more than anything was not being a part of hip hop. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3018.88s)]
*  And so it just ended up being incredibly high leverage in a way that I don't think that I [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3024.48s)]
*  thought it was going to be. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3030.0s)]
*  So I can make an argument that like this, because of those reasons, that this is the [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3031.36s)]
*  most consequential one that I can. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3036.08s)]
*  Well, the other way to help your argument is the best song that came out of this whole beef [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3038.88s)]
*  becomes one of the best songs of the decade. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3044.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3046.2400000000002s)]
*  At least most famous, most influential, will be most discussed 20 years from now. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3046.56s)]
*  And people are like the 2020s, what were the big songs? [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3051.28s)]
*  It'll be one of the first ones mentioned. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3054.48s)]
*  All the other rap beef songs, none of them hit the heights that this did. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3056.32s)]
*  This is basically, I'm not going to say Michael Jackson thriller territory, but like that one [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3060.56s)]
*  level below. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3066.08s)]
*  Well, it was going to be difficult for first off, fuck your bitch in a clique you claim to [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3066.88s)]
*  really, really go pop. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3071.52s)]
*  So it was going to be difficult for that to really, really go pop. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3072.88s)]
*  But I would say that culturally, Hit Em Up was being played in the club. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3078.16s)]
*  Like this is different. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3083.68s)]
*  This is a number one. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3084.7999999999997s)]
*  They weren't playing Hit Em Up at the Super Bowl. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3085.44s)]
*  They weren't going to play Hit Em Up. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3087.36s)]
*  It's like, Aaron, it's halftime of Chargers Niners. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3088.0s)]
*  Here comes Hit Em Up. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3092.8s)]
*  Here comes Pac. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3094.0s)]
*  Oh, he's got a lot of red on. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3095.28s)]
*  But they weren't going to play that. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3097.6s)]
*  But this one, it went everywhere. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3098.96s)]
*  And that was also, once again, it was kind of Kendrick saying, you know, not that he [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3100.24s)]
*  hadn't had hit records. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3105.04s)]
*  It was Kendrick saying, I can make a hit record that dances on your grave. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3106.08s)]
*  You know, for making the people dance, I can have those same people dancing on your grave. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3109.6s)]
*  And he did that. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3114.96s)]
*  It's a tough one. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3116.56s)]
*  I don't know how Drake bounces back from it. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3117.52s)]
*  It's also there's a talent issue, too. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3119.6s)]
*  It's successful and great as Drake's some of his stuff has been. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3121.68s)]
*  Kendrick's just levitating at a slightly different level. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3126.08s)]
*  How much you like his music, whatever. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3130.64s)]
*  He's the best artist that the genre has produced in the last 12 years. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3132.56s)]
*  Drake is insanely talented. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3136.4s)]
*  Kendrick takes himself. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3138.96s)]
*  Kendrick is a one on one. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3140.64s)]
*  He'll never be recreated. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3142.4s)]
*  He makes more important music. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3143.68s)]
*  He I think the music that he makes is probably a higher difficulty. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3145.12s)]
*  I don't want to take anything away from Drake's talent, but I don't want. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3149.92s)]
*  But he's insanely talented. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3153.2000000000003s)]
*  Kendrick, you can't make that many great hits without being talented. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3155.6800000000003s)]
*  That is something that we ain't never seen. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3159.76s)]
*  I mean, and we knew this. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3162.0s)]
*  He's just it's almost like he didn't want to like he's something that we never seen before. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3163.6s)]
*  To me, to me and a lot of people would feel that way about other artists, about Drake. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3167.6800000000003s)]
*  Like Kendrick's ability to communicate, but also to be relatable. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3172.08s)]
*  All of that stuff. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3178.3199999999997s)]
*  He's just different to me. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3179.04s)]
*  You think Drake because Kendrick short, I think Drake really missed the. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3180.3199999999997s)]
*  I think like his this response could have just been like an entire short song. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3185.2s)]
*  He's talked about the fact that he's short though. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3190.08s)]
*  But he didn't really go after it. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3191.68s)]
*  I think that's like his one move left and it'll probably be clumsy and not work well. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3193.68s)]
*  He should have sampled short people. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3197.84s)]
*  Just a whole short song, just like just mocking Kendrick for being short. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3199.68s)]
*  It's like his only move left now. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3203.68s)]
*  The problem is, is that you'll do that. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3205.3599999999997s)]
*  But the reality is like, then you look thin skin. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3208.72s)]
*  No, it's an extra thing with Kendrick because Kendrick on one of these records, [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3211.2s)]
*  Kendrick says it might be on Dodger Blue. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3214.8799999999997s)]
*  He says, have you ever ran a fade that ran three more back to back? [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3217.52s)]
*  If not, then shut the fuck up and keep it wrapped. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3221.6s)]
*  And that's basically he's saying, like, if you want to fight, we can fight. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3223.6s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3227.9199999999996s)]
*  You want to fight like we could fight too. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3228.56s)]
*  The thing is, with how psychotic we've seen that he is, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3231.04s)]
*  you just don't know the level that he won't go to. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3235.92s)]
*  So it's like the best thing to do is just to rap about it. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3238.16s)]
*  Just rap. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3241.2799999999997s)]
*  And Kendrick's going on tour. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3241.84s)]
*  Going on tour. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3243.44s)]
*  And this will just keep going and going. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3244.4s)]
*  It's time to let it go. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3246.88s)]
*  Kendrick's not letting it go. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3250.16s)]
*  He doesn't want to make the mistake of orienting his career around Drake. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3251.36s)]
*  No. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3255.92s)]
*  One, get back to pushing the culture forward like you always have. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3256.16s)]
*  You've done the victory lap. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3259.92s)]
*  There's no bigger victory lap than the Super Bowl. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3260.96s)]
*  Get back to doing the same. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3262.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3263.44s)]
*  So you're Drake's Tom Hagan. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3263.6s)]
*  You're his concilier. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3265.36s)]
*  He hires you for a week. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3266.32s)]
*  What are your two pieces of advice for Drake? [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3268.24s)]
*  OK, two pieces of advice. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3270.4s)]
*  First of all, Tom Hagan, not a wartime concilier. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3271.6s)]
*  Well, how about this? [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3274.48s)]
*  Maybe he was. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3275.68s)]
*  They just didn't give him the chance. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3276.56s)]
*  Maybe Sonny was. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3278.48s)]
*  They just decided he wasn't. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3279.04s)]
*  Maybe Sonny was just a terrible. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3280.64s)]
*  Let me tell you what, my Kraut McFriend. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3281.52s)]
*  She was the best and I've had them all over the place. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3286.0s)]
*  Now you get your ass out of here. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3289.52s)]
*  He doesn't get that movie. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3291.92s)]
*  What would I tell Drake to do? [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3296.48s)]
*  Number one, the first thing I would say is just remember that you're Drake. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3297.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3300.64s)]
*  OK, remember that you are literally the artist of the decades of the 2010s. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3300.88s)]
*  So number one, it's going to be OK. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3305.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3307.28s)]
*  All right. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3307.6s)]
*  Take a breath. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3308.16s)]
*  Go to booby trap. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3309.28s)]
*  Chill out for a second. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3310.4s)]
*  And also remember why people love you. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3311.68s)]
*  They don't love you because you are the most devastating battle rapper of all time. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3314.0s)]
*  They don't love you because of that. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3319.44s)]
*  You already occurred out of one battle. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3320.7200000000003s)]
*  They love you because you make hits. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3322.6400000000003s)]
*  So come back with some fire. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3326.1600000000003s)]
*  Chill and come back with some fire. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3328.88s)]
*  And I'd say something else. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3330.2400000000002s)]
*  I said this on higher learning and racial disagreed and the entire audience disagree. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3331.84s)]
*  Oh, I can't wait. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3335.6800000000003s)]
*  If I were Drake. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3337.2000000000003s)]
*  If this is possible with Jay-Z running things, right? [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3340.0800000000004s)]
*  Because I know they don't have the best relationship. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3343.28s)]
*  If I were Drake, I would do the Super Bowl next year. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3344.88s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3349.2000000000003s)]
*  Yep. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3349.84s)]
*  If I were Drake, I know it seems like he's coming behind Kendrick. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3351.28s)]
*  But let me tell you what if Drake does the Super Bowl next year. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3355.2000000000003s)]
*  Let me tell you what can happen. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3357.6800000000003s)]
*  Number one, he can do something. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3358.48s)]
*  He can answer the little Wayne question because Lil Wayne wants to do the Super Bowl. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3360.88s)]
*  Lil Wayne and Drake could do a whole set at the Super Bowl. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3365.36s)]
*  Then Drake looks like for the entire South, which likes Drake anyway. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3369.36s)]
*  So now this is it's almost like politics. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3373.76s)]
*  You're trying to win the South. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3375.76s)]
*  Now it looks like Drake is the one who it looks like Kendrick took the Super Bowl stage away from [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3377.6800000000003s)]
*  Wayne and Drake is the one who gave Wayne his due. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3382.56s)]
*  You can do the young money thing. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3385.6s)]
*  Drake could do a whole Super Bowl. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3386.8s)]
*  Whereas Kendrick did a Super Bowl that was very dedicated to his audience [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3388.7200000000003s)]
*  and didn't have some of the hits that he knew before. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3393.2000000000003s)]
*  Drake could do a whole Super Bowl of just hits. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3395.2000000000003s)]
*  It could be just hits. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3398.0s)]
*  If people talk about they love hits, Drake could do such a low stakes Super Bowl. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3399.04s)]
*  Yeah, I'm talking about nice for what hotline bling miss me. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3404.0s)]
*  I'm talking about so many joints. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3408.48s)]
*  I'm talking about all the joints with and it could be hip hop because he could have [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3410.16s)]
*  gonna and Lil Baby out there. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3415.52s)]
*  If those guys will be on the same stage, he could have Doug out there. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3416.88s)]
*  He could have literally a Super Bowl full of hits and pop records and people would like it. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3419.44s)]
*  And he could leave re asserting. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3427.52s)]
*  But that's 11 months from now. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3430.4s)]
*  I know for that 11 months, you got to. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3432.0s)]
*  Oof. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3434.08s)]
*  I mean, you do the Will Smith. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3434.8s)]
*  You chill. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3436.56s)]
*  You're just gone. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3437.04s)]
*  You chill. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3437.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, he already dropped the album, so he's probably going to he's on tour. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3438.16s)]
*  Ben Simmons thinks he's dead. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3441.2s)]
*  He's not dead. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3442.88s)]
*  He said it's done. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3443.68s)]
*  He's like, nobody cares about Drake anymore. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3445.36s)]
*  Ben Simmons quote, my 17 year old son who knows everything. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3447.2799999999997s)]
*  That could be true, but I don't think it's true, but that a lot of people care less than they did. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3449.84s)]
*  But even his back catalog, even his back catalog is enough that Drake will never be out of the [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3455.44s)]
*  public eye. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3461.84s)]
*  I like your idea of him attacking different parts of the country correctly. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3462.2400000000002s)]
*  Almost like he's running for an election. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3466.96s)]
*  He's like, all right, where's Kendrick weak? [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3468.88s)]
*  I can get him in the South. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3471.1200000000003s)]
*  Can I get him in the Northeast? [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3472.88s)]
*  Like just start picking different pockets, culminating in the Super Bowl show. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3474.32s)]
*  Also, I'll just say this. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3478.2400000000002s)]
*  Drake, his support was cratering a little bit before this because Drake had, in my opinion, [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3480.6400000000003s)]
*  made some really weird moves like the decision to kind of support Tory Lane's and dismay the [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3490.0800000000004s)]
*  stallion when black women had been the ones that had been supporting Drake. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3496.0s)]
*  And like even when other black men would be like, ah, Drake too soft. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3500.88s)]
*  It was black women that held Drake down and really like really kept him at the superstar level. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3506.56s)]
*  And I just remember when he made the decision to make light of mad getting shot and to outwardly [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3515.28s)]
*  support Tory like that, a lot of women were like, what is he doing? [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3520.7200000000003s)]
*  Like, what's the deal? [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3524.64s)]
*  And so a lot of the insulation that he would have had from getting his ass lit up like he did [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3525.6800000000003s)]
*  was gone for a lot of different reasons. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3530.7200000000003s)]
*  For a lot of the, he had decided for some reason before all of this started to go heel a little bit. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3533.12s)]
*  Yeah, but it's almost like wrestling. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3543.12s)]
*  I always feel like pop artists, different musicians, different genres, [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3544.8s)]
*  you got like an eight to 12 year shelf life. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3550.08s)]
*  And then you got to start figuring out next acts. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3553.6800000000003s)]
*  Like you think about even like somebody like Hulk Hogan, right? [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3555.84s)]
*  Comes in, hits big in the 84 range. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3558.64s)]
*  And by the time we get to like when he turned and WCW, yeah, that was like 11, 12 year mark [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3561.92s)]
*  because it was like his character had run its course the way he was doing it. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3566.8s)]
*  It's got to flip it. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3570.7200000000003s)]
*  Now I'm going to darken my beard and become Hollywood Hogan with think about how many [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3571.6s)]
*  musicians have been able to even hit musicians, make big hits have been able to last longer than [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3576.48s)]
*  10 years. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3581.84s)]
*  By the way, another one is funny actors like comedians, like comedians in movies, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3583.76s)]
*  churning out like funny stuff that we care about. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3588.48s)]
*  It's like eight to 10 years. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3590.64s)]
*  But those comedians, then they have to audible. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3592.0s)]
*  Then they start make a drama. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3595.12s)]
*  Start doing drama. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3596.8799999999997s)]
*  Now all of a sudden you're on like a streamer show. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3597.7599999999998s)]
*  Like you got to start. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3599.92s)]
*  And I think it's really tough to stay relevant in music for that long because eventually the new [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3601.44s)]
*  kids that are listening to it are going to determine who's hot. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3605.7599999999998s)]
*  And they don't want to root for like, they don't want to like their dad's music. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3609.6s)]
*  They want their own music. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3613.04s)]
*  But once again, another reason why it was smart that Kendra did it, the timing. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3614.24s)]
*  He, Drake was at kind of a little low, a lower point. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3620.56s)]
*  He's still making hit records. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3625.6800000000003s)]
*  C.L.B. for all the dogs. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3626.64s)]
*  All those things still sold really well. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3627.6800000000003s)]
*  And he hit them when he was down a little bit. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3629.28s)]
*  So we'll see. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3630.8s)]
*  But everybody is OK to like Kendrick and Drake. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3631.6800000000003s)]
*  It's OK. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3635.04s)]
*  Van Lathan just trying to heal America. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3635.6800000000003s)]
*  Hey, it's OK to put on Not Like Us. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3637.28s)]
*  Then listen to Family Matters. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3640.32s)]
*  It's OK to listen to push ups like and Euphoria. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3641.76s)]
*  You can listen. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3645.44s)]
*  I listened to nonstop this morning when I was walking the dog. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3646.32s)]
*  It's OK, you guys. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3649.52s)]
*  You guys can like both guys. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3650.32s)]
*  It's OK. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3651.52s)]
*  It's all right. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3652.08s)]
*  And if you have your Kanye playlist, maybe roll the windows up as you're jamming along to it right now. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3652.96s)]
*  Some of the records going to get played. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wXXg8xxpg&t=3658.24s)]
