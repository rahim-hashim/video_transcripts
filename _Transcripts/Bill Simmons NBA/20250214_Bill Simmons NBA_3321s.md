# Stephen Curry’s Last Ride, Philly’s Shocking Swoon and an NBA 6-Pack | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g)
*  Golden states the 10 seed with 27 losses. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=0.0s)]
*  Minnesota's the seventh seed with 25 losses. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2.4s)]
*  I'm the most interested in the Warriors. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=5.96s)]
*  And I've watched every minute of all of their games [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=9.84s)]
*  since they made this Jimmy Butler trade. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=11.84s)]
*  And there's something here. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=13.88s)]
*  And I don't know what it is yet, but I like it. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=15.9s)]
*  I don't know where it's gonna go. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=19.56s)]
*  Their ceiling feels a little higher. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  I don't think they're gonna win the title, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=23.52s)]
*  but they're the most intriguing team to me. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=25.48s)]
*  That's not Denver or the Lakers are obviously okay. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  I think they're the fourth most intriguing team to me, Rob. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=30.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=32.72s)]
*  Can I suggest what the thing is that you might be seeing? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=33.72s)]
*  Yeah, let's see. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=36.76s)]
*  I would say two things maybe. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=37.96s)]
*  Golden state actually shooting free throws. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=39.68s)]
*  Great. Jimmy Butler helps with that. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=41.48s)]
*  Two, something very exotic for the Warriors, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=43.239999999999995s)]
*  attempting to score around the basket [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=46.28s)]
*  and sometimes doing so successfully. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=47.92s)]
*  Like they blow a lot of layups. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=49.76s)]
*  They have a lot of guys who clam up a little bit [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=51.76s)]
*  around the basket or can get stifled out with length. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=54.86s)]
*  They obviously play really small. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=57.0s)]
*  But having Jimmy as any kind of presence inside, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=58.84s)]
*  even if he's also missing some layups now and again, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=61.92s)]
*  just as a cutter, as a driver, as a transition force, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=64.4s)]
*  it's a nice counterbalance to everything else [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  that the Warriors have going on offensively. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=70.08s)]
*  Yeah, it feels like I rounded them out. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=72.28s)]
*  I also, like you mentioned the rebounding, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=74.4s)]
*  the offensive rebounding, the free throws. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=76.88s)]
*  That game yesterday that they played against Dallas, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=79.28s)]
*  where it basically came down to Moody makes a corner three, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  I think they win. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=83.48s)]
*  If Jimmy just goes to the basket with his right hand [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=84.56s)]
*  instead of crossing over going to a Kyrie, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  they might win that one too. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  But the symmetry of the team seems to make sense now [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  because Jimmy, even though, what is he, 6'5", 6'6"? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=93.64s)]
*  I think he's more 6'7", 6'8", right? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=97.44s)]
*  All right, wherever he is. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=99.04s)]
*  There's a post-up element with them [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=101.0s)]
*  that they just didn't have before unless it was Kaminga. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=102.5s)]
*  And when it's Kaminga, you lose some of the IQ stuff. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=105.12s)]
*  With Butler, you don't. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=108.88s)]
*  You get the IQ stuff. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=110.0s)]
*  So now you have him, with Draymond, with Steph. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=111.12s)]
*  And it's funny to call them a high IQ team [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=113.64s)]
*  because they also make some of the stupidest plays [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=115.48s)]
*  you'll see every night. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=117.52s)]
*  I don't think any team has sloppy or worse turnovers. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  And yet they are a high IQ team. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=121.88s)]
*  Like Steve Kerr is about to have an aneurysm [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=123.6s)]
*  at any given moment in these games. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=126.12s)]
*  And you get it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=127.36s)]
*  Like some of the passes Draymond throws [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=128.2s)]
*  for being a genius level playmaker [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=130.16s)]
*  are absolutely baffling. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=133.24s)]
*  Indefensible decision-making at times. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=134.88s)]
*  And yet they get away with it [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=137.76s)]
*  because they have these hot shooting stretches. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=139.04s)]
*  Their defense is obviously still pretty rock solid overall. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=140.96s)]
*  And I think we'll only get better with Jimmy. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=143.92s)]
*  But ultimately I'm totally with you [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=146.24s)]
*  as far as the post-up elements of Jimmy's game. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=148.32s)]
*  He's so intuitive in terms of the way he moves. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  That has fit in Golden State really seamlessly. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=152.96s)]
*  And he also just in staggering him and Steph a little bit, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=155.96s)]
*  it gives the Warriors something to do. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=159.2s)]
*  And like they were really lacking that [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=161.12s)]
*  when Steph was off the floor. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=162.6s)]
*  It's like, what do we run? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=163.44s)]
*  I guess Brandon Pajemski is gonna dribble for 18 seconds. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=164.84s)]
*  There was way too much of that happening. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=167.72s)]
*  And Jimmy Butler, if nothing else, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=169.8s)]
*  he's gonna be able to orient them to, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=171.2s)]
*  okay, this is an actual first option, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=172.44s)]
*  even if he's not pounding the air out of the ball. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=174.92s)]
*  It's also a team that when Kaminga comes back [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=177.56s)]
*  becomes even more interesting [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=180.96s)]
*  because now they'll have multiple things to look at. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  They can ride him. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=184.88s)]
*  There's some Butler Kaminga stuff already. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  I don't know if you've seen it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=188.24s)]
*  Little hint of I might take this guy under my wing. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=190.04s)]
*  Little mutual admiration society stuff. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  Maybe I'll take him to Jimmy Butler grad school. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=196.2s)]
*  Not teach him the stuff from the last year in Miami, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=198.68s)]
*  but the first couple of years. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=201.44s)]
*  One of the things that's been so much fun to watch [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=202.60000000000002s)]
*  with these Golden State games [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=204.36s)]
*  is just having Butler back as an invested, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=206.0s)]
*  happy, engaged guy in the sidelines doing like fish bumps. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=210.52s)]
*  Just super competitive aggro [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=215.36s)]
*  and not looking like he just lost his dog. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=217.28s)]
*  And that he wants to just walk off the court. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=220.04000000000002s)]
*  So I'm glad to have him back. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=222.36s)]
*  Even in the games, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=223.84s)]
*  Jimmy Butler is one of the best contested rebounders [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=225.0s)]
*  in the league in terms of just the overall effort [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=227.88000000000002s)]
*  he puts in and how he goes after it even against Biggs. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=230.4s)]
*  And if we're going to talk about like how Golden State [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  makes a run or how they hold it together, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=235.36s)]
*  how they challenge some of these other elite [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=237.08s)]
*  Western Conference teams. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=238.64000000000001s)]
*  A big part of that is Jimmy Butler makes the version [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=240.16s)]
*  of small ball they play make a lot more sense. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=243.24s)]
*  Moses Moody has been a thing for a while now, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=246.4s)]
*  but the Moses Moody minutes make even more sense [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=248.68s)]
*  when you put in with Jimmy Butler. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  Kaminga is going to be a little different [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=253.04000000000002s)]
*  just because they are a little bit duplicative. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  They're going to be a little trickier to play together, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=256.96000000000004s)]
*  especially if Draymond is also on the floor. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=259.8s)]
*  Like that's, it can jam up a little bit too much. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=261.6s)]
*  And I'm curious to see what Kerr does with that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=264.72s)]
*  How he tries to separate those guys, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=266.68s)]
*  if at all on the rotation, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=268.28000000000003s)]
*  because they're going to have to play a lot. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=269.24s)]
*  And Dallas in the first half of last night's game [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=271.48s)]
*  tried to use the Draymond, Jimmy lack of shooting [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=273.8s)]
*  from deep thing against them. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=277.8s)]
*  And then Golden State figured that out. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=279.52s)]
*  They went with a small ball thing. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  Dallas didn't have their centers last night, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=282.24s)]
*  so it's hard to make too much out of it, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=283.76s)]
*  but they went small. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=285.68s)]
*  I guess Jimmy was the four. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=287.12s)]
*  And then they had Moody and Pizemski and Curry [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=289.88s)]
*  with Draymond and it was fun. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=291.96s)]
*  They were like cussing around [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=293.24s)]
*  and it was old school Draymond. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=294.52s)]
*  Here's the thing I'm watching with them. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=296.08s)]
*  And I've been watching this for a while. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=297.88s)]
*  And I really started thinking about it [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=299.88s)]
*  with the Ringer 100, with that exercise [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=301.4s)]
*  of just trying to rank the best players against each other. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=303.71999999999997s)]
*  And Curry was just a blind top seven, top eight guy. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=306.52s)]
*  Not positive he's there anymore. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=311.44s)]
*  And I don't know where he is in the top 20, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=313.44s)]
*  but there's two things I've noticed. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  One is the consistency of being great [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=318.16s)]
*  just doesn't seem there. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=321.72s)]
*  He's become a once a week, I'm awesome guy. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=322.8s)]
*  He doesn't have the great kick ass games [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=326.52000000000004s)]
*  that he used to have. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=328.84000000000003s)]
*  And I actually went through and I just looked at two things [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=330.56s)]
*  because this is hard to kind of quantify. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=335.0s)]
*  How do you measure somebody's ceiling as a great player [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=336.84000000000003s)]
*  versus where it's been the last 10 years? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=341.08000000000004s)]
*  He's 36 years old. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=342.88s)]
*  You can look at all the counting stats. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  They're down a little bit, but not too much. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=346.8s)]
*  But the thing that was interesting to me, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=348.28000000000003s)]
*  so in 2016, his second MVP season, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=350.2s)]
*  he had 13, 40 plus point games. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=353.64000000000004s)]
*  And then if you go on basketball reference, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=357.16s)]
*  that weird game score thing they have [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=359.08000000000004s)]
*  that I think I mostly like, it's at least, it's something. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=360.64000000000004s)]
*  If you're in the high 20s or higher, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=366.88s)]
*  that means something good happened [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=369.20000000000005s)]
*  with the game you played. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=371.0s)]
*  So he had- [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=373.04s)]
*  He's got a star of box score stats, right? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=373.88s)]
*  It gives you a general indication that something is up. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=375.71999999999997s)]
*  It's that you did a bunch of things well in the same game [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=378.4s)]
*  at kind of an unusually high level. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=382.28s)]
*  So about 29 is a really nice game score on basketball. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=385.0s)]
*  It's again, arbitrary. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=388.4s)]
*  But he had 24, 29 plus games [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=389.88s)]
*  from a game score standpoint in 16. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=393.36s)]
*  This season he has three. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=395.8s)]
*  This season he has zero 40 point games. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=397.88s)]
*  So even if you go back to 2022, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=400.6s)]
*  he had seven 40 point games in their final season. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=402.76000000000005s)]
*  He had 10, 29 plus game score games. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=406.76000000000005s)]
*  In 23, he had 13, 29 plus game score. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=410.36s)]
*  The point is, every once in a while, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=413.12s)]
*  Steph Curry was like, we're not losing tonight. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=414.76000000000005s)]
*  I'm Steph Curry, I'm just gonna have an awesome game. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=416.56s)]
*  And that's really not what I'm seeing from him [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  in the same way this year. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=421.44s)]
*  And I wonder if it changes after the All-Star break [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=422.40000000000003s)]
*  or is this just who he is at age 36? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=425.12s)]
*  I don't know the answer. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=427.8s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=428.64000000000004s)]
*  I suspect having Jimmy will help with some of that. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=429.48s)]
*  And just from an overall workload perspective, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=431.8s)]
*  Jimmy and Kumminga coming back [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=434.36s)]
*  will lift some of what is on Steph right now. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=436.8s)]
*  Ultimately though, I think that is who he is [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=440.56s)]
*  at this point in his career. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=442.64000000000004s)]
*  I don't think he's gonna have those singular scoring outbursts [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=443.64000000000004s)]
*  all the time. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=446.72s)]
*  But the good news for Golden State, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=448.04s)]
*  I don't think the rest of the league [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=450.40000000000003s)]
*  has entirely caught up to that. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=451.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't think they will catch up to that. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=453.16s)]
*  Because history tells us they don't with legends, right? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=455.08000000000004s)]
*  You put Steph Curry on the floor, someone sees him, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=458.48s)]
*  they are gonna freak out. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=461.36s)]
*  And that's why virtually regardless of how many points [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=462.68s)]
*  Steph actually scores, he has a massive, massive [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=465.44s)]
*  on court impact in terms of the offensive production. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=468.68s)]
*  He is not at a Jokic level, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=471.68s)]
*  because Jokic is really in a class unto himself there, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=473.52s)]
*  but with Shea, right? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=476.92s)]
*  With the other really high level offensive operators [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=478.52s)]
*  in terms of the difference of having him on the court, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=481.15999999999997s)]
*  even when he's not hitting consistently, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=483.76s)]
*  even when he's not going for 35 or 40 points, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=485.36s)]
*  he just scares the hell out of people. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=487.68s)]
*  I think that part will always be true, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=489.12s)]
*  even if Steph is 45 rolling out there. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=491.24s)]
*  Yeah, if you're saying what defender makes a guy [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=494.08s)]
*  who's in the paint who realizes he's open, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=496.76s)]
*  run full speed at him like he's running out of a cabin [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=499.36s)]
*  in a horror movie. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=502.0s)]
*  Steph is still number one in this. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=502.91999999999996s)]
*  The other piece of it is they had to work so hard [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=505.08s)]
*  to get him offense in the first half of the season [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=507.36s)]
*  with this goofy team they had. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=510.2s)]
*  And he also had to play a lot [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=512.92s)]
*  because their record wasn't that good. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=514.36s)]
*  And I do wonder with the reset of the break [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=516.9599999999999s)]
*  and then the Jimmy piece of it [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=519.4799999999999s)]
*  and the symmetry of the offense coming into play [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=521.0s)]
*  a little bit and then Kaminga comes back, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=523.0799999999999s)]
*  maybe it'll be easier for him to rack it up and have. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=525.3199999999999s)]
*  The thing that would make him special [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=530.76s)]
*  were the 16 point third quarters [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=532.12s)]
*  and just the little scoring barrages. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=534.28s)]
*  That's what's not happening anymore. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=536.24s)]
*  And then you throw in the sloppiness. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=537.8399999999999s)]
*  Their clutch record this year, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=539.9599999999999s)]
*  I think they're just like 500. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=541.3199999999999s)]
*  And they've blown a bunch of dumb games. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=543.64s)]
*  They've just been in a lot of close games, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=547.5600000000001s)]
*  which that in itself, as you're saying, is taxing [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=549.44s)]
*  because it forces Steph to play more minutes [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=551.36s)]
*  to even get to that point. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=552.9200000000001s)]
*  The reason I think it's important, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=554.52s)]
*  I'm not doing the ESPN thing where it's like, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=556.32s)]
*  just A block, just talk Warriors or Lakers. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=558.44s)]
*  And that's it, that's the rule. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=561.0s)]
*  I really do think there's something here. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=563.28s)]
*  I think there's something here [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=565.88s)]
*  with the Butler, Curry, Draymond thing. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=566.9200000000001s)]
*  I kind of like their role guys. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=568.88s)]
*  And I think if they can hang around, hang around, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=570.88s)]
*  there's a competitive kind of intuitive infrastructure [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=573.84s)]
*  that some of these other teams don't have. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=578.6s)]
*  Like I don't trust Houston to have it. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=580.56s)]
*  Memphis, I don't know what to make of anymore. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=583.12s)]
*  I just assume Jaws not playing now when I turn Memphis on, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=585.28s)]
*  it's like surprising to see him. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=588.2s)]
*  It's one thing after another with him. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=589.64s)]
*  And then Minnesota is a mess. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=592.72s)]
*  I don't try, especially when Edwards has, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=595.0s)]
*  Edwards has had two like really, really, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=597.44s)]
*  really awful games around. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=599.16s)]
*  They did win tonight, they beat OKC. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=600.24s)]
*  But just, maybe Minnesota will be the only one I see [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=603.6s)]
*  that I could see in the conference finals. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=608.24s)]
*  I don't think it's gonna be Dallas. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=609.96s)]
*  OKC Denver, is there anybody else you have on your radar [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=611.28s)]
*  to maybe make the West finals [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=615.04s)]
*  and do like what Dallas did last year? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=616.52s)]
*  Dallas catches fire, they have that streak, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=617.96s)]
*  all of a sudden they're in conversation. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=620.2s)]
*  Who is that this year? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=621.64s)]
*  I still give Memphis a little credit in that conversation. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=622.76s)]
*  I think we clearly have to wait [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=625.52s)]
*  and see what the Lakers are capable of. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=627.8s)]
*  But at this point, Denver's got the inside track. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=630.24s)]
*  And teams are gonna have to figure out [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=633.16s)]
*  not just how to outflank them, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=634.72s)]
*  but how to beat them specifically [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=636.52s)]
*  if that matchup comes on board, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=637.84s)]
*  which is, I would say the toughest single matchup [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=639.16s)]
*  available to anyone is what do you do [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=641.8s)]
*  with Nicole Jokic right now? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=643.4s)]
*  Because we're seeing Minnesota case in point tonight. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=645.1999999999999s)]
*  OKC is a vaunted, unbelievable defense. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=648.12s)]
*  But Minnesota has some inroads there [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=651.1999999999999s)]
*  to score against a team like that. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=653.4399999999999s)]
*  Naz Reid is clearly a huge part of that formula. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=654.68s)]
*  Granted, they're not playing with their usual team. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=657.72s)]
*  Julius Randle, out Rudy Gobert, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=660.1999999999999s)]
*  and finally, Dante DiVincenzo. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=661.8s)]
*  And yet- [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=663.4s)]
*  And Gobert didn't play tonight either. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=664.24s)]
*  Absolutely, they didn't have the ability, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=665.96s)]
*  they didn't have their normal set of players, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=667.8s)]
*  but they found things that could work [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=669.6s)]
*  against the Thunder defense for as wonderful as it is. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=671.24s)]
*  I don't know that there's those answers [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=674.08s)]
*  for many teams about Nicole Jokic. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=675.96s)]
*  There's just not a lot of conceptual stuff [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=678.1999999999999s)]
*  you can throw at him that's going to work. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=680.0s)]
*  That's not to say you can't leverage [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=682.16s)]
*  the occasional off night from Jamal Murray, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=684.16s)]
*  elements of Russell Westbrook's game, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=686.04s)]
*  parts of the back end of the rotation, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=687.68s)]
*  Michael Porter maybe not swinging the ball [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=689.36s)]
*  as fast as the Nuggets might like him to sometimes. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=692.4799999999999s)]
*  There's buttons to press, the Nuggets are not unbeatable, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=694.56s)]
*  but they look really tough right now. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=697.68s)]
*  And they look like a really tough matchup specifically [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=699.1999999999999s)]
*  for the rest of this Western Conference field. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=701.4399999999999s)]
*  Murray came back. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=703.64s)]
*  With the- [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=706.28s)]
*  Russell and I did that live show in Denver. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=707.1199999999999s)]
*  55 fucking points. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=707.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we had a heart to heart with 1,100 Nuggets fans. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=709.04s)]
*  Murray thing is bad. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=713.1999999999999s)]
*  This is alarming, what's happening. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=714.88s)]
*  But the best case scenario was, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=716.9599999999999s)]
*  he just needs to play himself in shape. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=719.8399999999999s)]
*  And he did, he played himself in shape. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=722.24s)]
*  And he looked noticeably skinnier within three weeks. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=724.04s)]
*  His burst came back. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=727.64s)]
*  The 55 point game he had this week was not an aberration. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=729.1999999999999s)]
*  He's been blowing by people and look like Murray. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=732.64s)]
*  So now all of a sudden those Jokic 48 point games, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=735.3599999999999s)]
*  those are out the window, you don't need them anymore. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=739.12s)]
*  Now he's back to being the, by the end of the third quarter, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=740.8399999999999s)]
*  he's got 22, 12, nine. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=744.0s)]
*  Porter's also playing better. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=747.28s)]
*  He's playing really well. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=749.04s)]
*  He's just like the Nuggets again. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=749.88s)]
*  So I don't know, people like this podcast for instance, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=751.08s)]
*  maybe overreacting through the first two months. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=754.48s)]
*  But the Murray thing was scary. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=757.0s)]
*  Because the Paul George thing was also scary. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=760.08s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=762.36s)]
*  That continues to be completely terrifying. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=763.36s)]
*  So, you know, there was real signs of danger, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=765.4399999999999s)]
*  but Murray played himself out of it, to his credit. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=768.28s)]
*  The Paul George thing is bordering on [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=770.96s)]
*  reanimated corpse at this point. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=772.92s)]
*  And Jamal Murray has found some kind of life, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=774.64s)]
*  some kind of burst. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=777.32s)]
*  And I think most importantly, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=778.3199999999999s)]
*  the edge and the aggressiveness in his game. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=779.76s)]
*  That's always, when Jamal is feeling [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=781.92s)]
*  whatever injuries he has at a given point, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=785.04s)]
*  or just a shaken confidence, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=786.9599999999999s)]
*  he doesn't push in the way that the Nuggets [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=788.56s)]
*  absolutely need him to push. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=790.88s)]
*  And to see that version of Jamal Murray back, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=792.3199999999999s)]
*  that's a thrilling thing to see. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=794.52s)]
*  So right now we have OKC Memphis, Denver is the top three. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=796.3199999999999s)]
*  Denver threatening to pass Memphis. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=799.8399999999999s)]
*  Houston Lakers and Houston just, you know, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=802.9599999999999s)]
*  has not been good for a couple of weeks, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=807.32s)]
*  but they've had some injuries. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=809.0400000000001s)]
*  Lakers, I don't know what happens with them, 32 and 20. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=811.44s)]
*  Clippers, 30 and 23 have been confusing [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=815.2s)]
*  for about a month now. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=818.12s)]
*  They're fine. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=819.5200000000001s)]
*  And then we move into that Minnesota, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=820.36s)]
*  Dallas, Sacramento, Golden State thing. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=821.24s)]
*  And we're gonna talk about it when we do the NBA six pack. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=823.24s)]
*  The most notable thing is the Spurs [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=825.12s)]
*  feel like they've fallen out. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=826.7600000000001s)]
*  And I think Phoenix is not dead, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=828.6s)]
*  but people are definitely around the table, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=834.2800000000001s)]
*  like John Hamm and Landman. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=836.16s)]
*  They're definitely around the hospital bed. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=837.8399999999999s)]
*  And maybe the doctor's like, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=840.4399999999999s)]
*  you might wanna say your goodbyes soon. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=841.9599999999999s)]
*  They're almost at that point. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=843.4399999999999s)]
*  But it feels like we actually might know [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=845.12s)]
*  the 10 playoff teams now. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=847.36s)]
*  Unless you think Sacramento can fall out of this, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=850.24s)]
*  because like they had a bad loss with New Orleans tonight. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=852.9599999999999s)]
*  They've won some goofy games. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=855.3199999999999s)]
*  They're 20 and 27. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=857.48s)]
*  They honestly could be like 22 and 34. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=858.6s)]
*  So if Phoenix was gonna catch a team, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=861.88s)]
*  that would be the team I pick. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=863.72s)]
*  But what do you think? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=865.76s)]
*  Do we have our 10 now? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=866.6s)]
*  I think this might be the 10. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=867.64s)]
*  And that is somewhat confidence in the Kings, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=869.4s)]
*  more so pessimism in the Suns on my part. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=872.28s)]
*  Okay, confidence in the Kings. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=875.64s)]
*  I mean, mild confidence. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=877.96s)]
*  You and Vivek. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=878.8000000000001s)]
*  I think they've got some stuff to work with. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=880.64s)]
*  Like I think they have a reasonable play in level roster [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=882.64s)]
*  as currently constructed. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=885.6800000000001s)]
*  I agree. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=886.8000000000001s)]
*  And there's nothing wrong with that. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=887.64s)]
*  But there's a reason we're not gonna be talking about them [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=888.76s)]
*  in the vein that we're talking about Golden State, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=891.32s)]
*  which is to say an actual threat potentially [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=893.1600000000001s)]
*  to do something with the talent that they have. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=896.24s)]
*  And we were talking about this on group chat today too. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=897.68s)]
*  I don't know if it's the Jimmy Butler element specifically [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=900.0799999999999s)]
*  that makes Golden State feel like a wild card [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=902.56s)]
*  in the same way that his Heat teams felt [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=904.9599999999999s)]
*  like a little bit of a wild card. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=906.48s)]
*  It's just hard to write off. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=908.12s)]
*  And it's hard to write off looking [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=909.3199999999999s)]
*  at this Golden State rotation and thinking, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=910.48s)]
*  okay, you know what? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=912.56s)]
*  Like when it really matters, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=913.4s)]
*  the Pat Spencer minutes are gonna evaporate [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=915.52s)]
*  and the Quinn Post minutes are gonna evaporate [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=917.56s)]
*  if they have to. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=919.48s)]
*  Like they're gonna get what they need [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=920.3199999999999s)]
*  out of these supporting guys, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=922.1999999999999s)]
*  but their best players are gonna go the distance. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=923.4399999999999s)]
*  And the question at that point will be [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=926.24s)]
*  how hard did Steph and Draymond and Jimmy have to push [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=927.5600000000001s)]
*  to get them into the play-in [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=931.44s)]
*  or to get them into the playoff? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=933.12s)]
*  And will they have enough left from that point? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=934.7600000000001s)]
*  You made a point earlier about Minnesota [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=937.36s)]
*  and how something about them seems comfortable against OKC, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=940.2800000000001s)]
*  which is something you couldn't really say [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=944.2s)]
*  about a lot of teams. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=945.5600000000001s)]
*  I think that might be just a lot of length on the perimeter [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=947.1600000000001s)]
*  and interchangeable guys and just people to throw at SGA. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=951.2800000000001s)]
*  And I think that's a good opportunity [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=955.88s)]
*  for how you beat OKC in a playoff series [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=957.28s)]
*  where one, SGA doesn't have a good game. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=959.16s)]
*  And then two, they don't make a ton of threes. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=962.12s)]
*  And it is a team, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=965.68s)]
*  and I guess you could say this about any team in the league, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=969.0799999999999s)]
*  but I really feel with them when they're down like 12 [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=971.28s)]
*  and you go, I mean, this is it. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=974.28s)]
*  This is how you beat them. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=976.4s)]
*  And then they win like their next 13 [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=977.48s)]
*  by an average of 20 points a game. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=979.3199999999999s)]
*  You can hit them with the haymaker. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=982.6s)]
*  So if they're down 3-2 in a playoff series on the road [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=984.12s)]
*  in a game like today, that would be the recipe, I think. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=988.12s)]
*  I still don't 100% trust anyone else on their team [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=991.08s)]
*  offensively except SGA. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=993.92s)]
*  And that's the one thing that gives me pause [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=996.08s)]
*  with like just pencil them in. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=998.6s)]
*  Like they have the best odds to win the West [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=999.84s)]
*  and it's an easy pick for the finals. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1001.92s)]
*  But that's the one thing that makes me nervous [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1004.24s)]
*  when it's really nerve wracking gut crunch time. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1005.96s)]
*  Ball crunch time, gut crunch? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1012.0s)]
*  Nut crunch, I think is the expression I'm looking for. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1013.96s)]
*  Did I just invent the phrase gut crunch? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1015.8s)]
*  The gut crunch, the old gut crunch. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1016.8s)]
*  Who am I going to if like Shea has five fouls [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1018.64s)]
*  late in the third quarter and I just need somebody [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1022.76s)]
*  to get me offense for like six minutes? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1024.72s)]
*  That's what makes me nervous with them. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1027.0s)]
*  The answer is probably JDubb, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1028.56s)]
*  and that's a reasonable answer, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1030.2s)]
*  but he also doesn't exactly play that way all the time. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1031.56s)]
*  Like they are such a process oriented team [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1034.6s)]
*  where they're just gonna move it [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1036.76s)]
*  and go through their system [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1038.04s)]
*  and trust in the shots that they get. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1039.2s)]
*  And I think reasonable people can disagree [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1041.92s)]
*  as to whether those shots are ultimately what you need [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1043.36s)]
*  in now TM gut crunching time. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1045.96s)]
*  I think gut crunch. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1049.84s)]
*  Look, they clearly need a little bit more as evidenced [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1051.52s)]
*  by the fact that they can occasionally put up [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1054.36s)]
*  like a 14.4th quarter like they did against Minnesota today. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1055.8799999999999s)]
*  That's not gonna do it. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1060.04s)]
*  Even in a game like this where you have a bit of a deficit [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1061.3999999999999s)]
*  you're working back from to begin with, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1063.68s)]
*  it's an area where you hope over time [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1065.2s)]
*  JDubb grows into that responsibility. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1067.16s)]
*  Chet Holmgroen who I think played his third game [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1069.08s)]
*  back from injury tonight, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1072.1200000000001s)]
*  he will grow into that responsibility over time hopefully. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1072.96s)]
*  He looks quite rusty understandably right now. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1075.64s)]
*  So he's gonna get better and better [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1078.28s)]
*  over the back part of the season. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1079.64s)]
*  But that's the wild card with them. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1081.24s)]
*  And I think if they don't do as well in the playoffs [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1082.44s)]
*  as they would have liked, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1085.24s)]
*  or as many of us would have anticipated, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1086.3600000000001s)]
*  a lot of us are gonna be wondering, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1088.8s)]
*  was there a lever to pull there [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1090.68s)]
*  in terms of getting more of a spark plug score [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1092.68s)]
*  at the deadline, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1095.0s)]
*  not someone who has to be a part of your permanent [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1095.8400000000001s)]
*  like a fixture in Oklahoma city, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1097.8400000000001s)]
*  a pillar of the community, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1099.6s)]
*  but could you not get a guy [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1101.36s)]
*  who could get a bucket on demand [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1102.6399999999999s)]
*  when you maybe really needed it? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1104.24s)]
*  We talked about a little last week. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1106.6799999999998s)]
*  I'm in the camp, they're playing so well [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1109.04s)]
*  and they look so good. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1110.56s)]
*  And Wiggins especially, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1111.6399999999999s)]
*  that was the spot you would have improved [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1113.1999999999998s)]
*  but he was just playing really well. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1114.7199999999998s)]
*  He was balling out, he was scoring in bunches. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1116.28s)]
*  Yeah, so all right, we trade Wiggins and contracts [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1119.08s)]
*  and a few of our picks to try to get Deandre Hunter. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1122.08s)]
*  Are we even better? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1124.9199999999998s)]
*  Wiggins was playing really well. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1125.9599999999998s)]
*  Would you rather pay Wiggins [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1128.32s)]
*  like a much smaller contract or Hunter 18 million. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1129.48s)]
*  I can see why they always value the continuity. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1132.6s)]
*  And it's one of those things that if it's in May [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1137.48s)]
*  and they lose them round two, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1139.3999999999999s)]
*  we're like, why didn't they make a trade? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1140.48s)]
*  I told you. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1142.04s)]
*  But you're right, it's hard to look at a roster [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1143.12s)]
*  winning 80% of its games and being like, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1144.96s)]
*  yeah, you should have done something. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1146.84s)]
*  They're doing a lot every night [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1148.56s)]
*  to beat basically every opponent put in front of them. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1150.04s)]
*  And a close team too, that really seems like, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1152.32s)]
*  that's where even the Cavs messing with what they have, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1154.76s)]
*  it gets a little dangerous when you have a team [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1158.9199999999998s)]
*  that clearly likes each other. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1160.72s)]
*  For sure. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1162.28s)]
*  Dallas is the only other team, just quickly. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1164.1999999999998s)]
*  Who knows when Davis comes back? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1167.52s)]
*  The way Kyrie has played and kind of, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1169.72s)]
*  I mean, this is one of the great 180s we've had [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1173.28s)]
*  by an athlete, Kyrie the last two years, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1176.0s)]
*  where I think he senses the moment in the city of Dallas [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1178.32s)]
*  and the press conferences, the interviews that he's given, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1182.76s)]
*  and the trade where he's like, no, no, I got this. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1186.36s)]
*  Come over here, don't abandon the ship yet. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1189.1999999999998s)]
*  If they can get Davis back in time, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1193.4799999999998s)]
*  I don't know if they can, but if they can, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1196.2399999999998s)]
*  it is an interesting team. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1199.2399999999998s)]
*  They have size, they have length, they have defense, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1201.76s)]
*  and the fans who seem like they were gonna revolt [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1203.9199999999998s)]
*  against this team even three days ago, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1206.1999999999998s)]
*  I don't know, they were into the game today. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1208.9199999999998s)]
*  They were cheering those guys. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1210.2399999999998s)]
*  So they're kind of, I guess, over here on this side, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1213.6s)]
*  depending on where they land. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1216.8s)]
*  Right now they are 30 and 26, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1217.64s)]
*  but no Davis for at least a month. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1220.3600000000001s)]
*  So they'll be somewhere between eight to 10, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1223.04s)]
*  I would say, in the play-in, right? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1225.28s)]
*  I would think, and look, the win over Golden State yesterday, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1226.8400000000001s)]
*  massive, massive game in terms of playing applications. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1230.68s)]
*  But yeah, they need Davis back, and more importantly, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1233.4s)]
*  they just need a big, a single able-bodied big [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1235.24s)]
*  who is not OMAX Prosper on stilts. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1239.3600000000001s)]
*  They just need somebody in that spot to do big man things. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1242.2s)]
*  And credit to them for getting by the way they have. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1245.52s)]
*  Credit to them for winning tonight, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1247.56s)]
*  not only under the circumstances missing all these bigs, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1248.76s)]
*  missing Anthony Davis, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1251.8s)]
*  but Kyrie didn't play in this game either. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1252.72s)]
*  But his spirit lived on in Dante Exum, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1254.44s)]
*  and they beat the Heat. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1256.4s)]
*  And Dallas just kind of keeps on marching right now. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1257.48s)]
*  It's been very impressive to see the way they've rallied. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1259.64s)]
*  They beat a Heat team [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1262.36s)]
*  that just looks mediocre every night now. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1263.36s)]
*  It just looks like it's the end of the line. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1266.32s)]
*  I'm thinking about the gut crunch. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1270.24s)]
*  It's like a 90s exercise machine. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1271.76s)]
*  Like I'm doing ads for it. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1275.4s)]
*  Yeah, the gut crunch right now. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1277.2s)]
*  Call now, it's half off. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1278.72s)]

*  McLoeb Ultra Superior is worth paying for. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1305.6s)]
*  Speaking of Superior, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1309.04s)]
*  let's unpack six major things going on [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1310.04s)]
*  in the basketball world right now. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1313.44s)]
*  We have to start with the 76ers. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1314.76s)]
*  So I was thinking big splash teams in the last 25 years [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1317.56s)]
*  that just ended up being disappointing. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1323.8799999999999s)]
*  Going back to post-lockout, the 1999 Rockets. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1326.6399999999999s)]
*  When they put Barkley and Pippen and Hakeem together [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1330.4399999999998s)]
*  and they were like, look at this. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1334.08s)]
*  And then it was bad. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1335.36s)]
*  The 2004 Lakers, even though they made the finals, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1337.6s)]
*  that was still kind of disappointing the way it ended. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1340.0s)]
*  But the big ones, 2013 Lakers with Dwight and with Nash. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1342.6s)]
*  Now this is gonna be fun. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1347.9199999999998s)]
*  Not fun. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1350.0s)]
*  Wasn't very fun. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1350.84s)]
*  The Prokhorov nets, post-KG trade with Pierce [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1351.6799999999998s)]
*  and Joe Johnson and Darren Williams and Prokhorov. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1355.84s)]
*  Oh my God, he's gonna basically do what the Dodgers [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1360.08s)]
*  just did in baseball. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1362.56s)]
*  It didn't happen. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1363.3999999999999s)]
*  2019 Celtics, after they made the Eastern Finals [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1364.68s)]
*  without Kyrie, Kyrie came back. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1367.8s)]
*  Hayward came back. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1370.3999999999999s)]
*  Tatum, Jalen Brown. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1371.84s)]
*  I think I went on Jalen and Jacoby's ESPN show [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1373.6s)]
*  and predicted them to win in the mid-60s. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1376.0s)]
*  That did not happen. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1377.72s)]
*  The 22 Lakers with LeBron and AD [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1379.04s)]
*  and a new addition, Russell Westbrook. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1382.52s)]
*  They ended up winning 33 games. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1385.24s)]
*  And then the nets after the foot on the line season. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1387.24s)]
*  Of course. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1390.76s)]
*  The KD, Kyrie, Harden thing. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1391.6000000000001s)]
*  Where does the Sixers just sucking? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1395.32s)]
*  They're 20 and 34. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1399.3600000000001s)]
*  Where does this rank on the, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1401.2s)]
*  I can't believe this is happening scale for you? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1402.52s)]
*  Because there were some signs. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1404.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard because there are the precursors. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1406.16s)]
*  I don't think any of us were fully trusting Joelle [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1409.0s)]
*  and Beats health coming into the season. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1411.28s)]
*  Certainly Paul George has given us reason to be dubious [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1413.16s)]
*  about his long-term ability to stay on the court. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1415.84s)]
*  But I would never have anticipated [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1418.84s)]
*  that basically every single thing [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1421.72s)]
*  that could go wrong has gone wrong. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1423.6799999999998s)]
*  At all, every bright spot that has emerged in the rotation [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1425.9599999999998s)]
*  short of Gershon Yabusele, which I'm not trying to jinx him, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1429.3999999999999s)]
*  wrap him in bubble wrap, protect Gershon at all costs, please. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1432.3999999999999s)]
*  Every other bright spot in the rotation has been snuffed out [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1435.6799999999998s)]
*  by injury, by circumstance, like nothing is working. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1438.36s)]
*  And that's hard to predict clearly, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1441.72s)]
*  but also hard to wrap your mind around, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1444.92s)]
*  like how so many things could go wrong at one time. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1446.28s)]
*  Yeah, so there was some Paul George stuff [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1449.04s)]
*  that came out today from Shams that he had [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1451.24s)]
*  a screwed up finger tendon on his left hand. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1454.5600000000002s)]
*  He's getting injections for it. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1458.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm sure that's true, but it doesn't explain the fact [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1461.76s)]
*  that he looks just slower and more plotting [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1466.16s)]
*  and doesn't seem to have nearly the same burst [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1469.44s)]
*  and just seems like not only a step slow, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1472.28s)]
*  but a second slow in his processing. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1475.52s)]
*  And I don't know how that's the left-hand tendon thing. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1479.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1482.56s)]
*  I don't think it is. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1483.44s)]
*  I mean, we can kind of parse those things out [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1484.72s)]
*  because there is the step slow thing as well. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1486.24s)]
*  You're not getting past Zaire Williams against the Nets. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1488.92s)]
*  That's a problem. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1493.8s)]
*  That's a problem in a game where Joel Embiid is not playing, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1494.88s)]
*  Tyrese Maxey is not playing. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1498.28s)]
*  This is your moment to do some of this [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1499.68s)]
*  and you make one shot and worse, you attempt seven. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1501.52s)]
*  Horrible, horrible game for Paul George. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1504.8s)]
*  All of that said, I have found myself [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1507.16s)]
*  at many points in the season [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1509.28s)]
*  being a bit of a Paul George apologist. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1511.4s)]
*  Look, those days are very much behind me at this point. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1514.76s)]
*  But the case for that apology, the defense of Paul George [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1517.92s)]
*  throughout most of the season has been [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1520.96s)]
*  a defense of the little things [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1523.6s)]
*  that he brings to the table. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1525.08s)]
*  It's orienting the offense. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1526.44s)]
*  It's being an adult on the court when they badly needed it. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1527.84s)]
*  It's spacing the floor. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1530.2s)]
*  It's keeping the ball moving. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1531.0400000000002s)]
*  Good connecting stuff, but role player stuff. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1532.5600000000002s)]
*  And at some point, if you're doing all the role player stuff [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1536.28s)]
*  and you're failing every time you're asked to be a star, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1539.16s)]
*  we have to call you what you are. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1541.96s)]
*  And it's a $50 million role player. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1543.3200000000002s)]
*  And that's a very tough position [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1545.28s)]
*  for the Sixers to find themselves [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1547.2s)]
*  at the very outset of this deal. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1548.64s)]
*  He hasn't helped himself with some of the comments either. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1550.72s)]
*  No. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1553.4s)]
*  Like when he complained about playing the five. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1554.24s)]
*  There hasn't been a lot of, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1556.1200000000001s)]
*  I'll do whatever it takes to win games. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1557.44s)]
*  If they need me to play there, I'll play there. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1560.1200000000001s)]
*  It's just, there's a lot of like basic, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1561.92s)]
*  you have to look at how the outside world [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1565.68s)]
*  is looking at you stuff with him. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1567.44s)]
*  That just seems to be missing. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1569.1200000000001s)]
*  A Sixer should know never to say that they're bored [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1570.68s)]
*  doing something like playing the five, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1573.24s)]
*  because life as a Sixer will be very interesting [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1574.68s)]
*  very quickly in ways that you do not want. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1577.76s)]
*  Well, the biggest thing they got was the Eagles [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1580.0800000000002s)]
*  had a playoff run and won the Superbowl. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1581.92s)]
*  That's very true. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1583.64s)]
*  And they, with Curtis and I talked about it on Thursday, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1584.48s)]
*  rarely seen Superbowl news dump after they won [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1587.64s)]
*  when they were like, hey, Embiid might get surgery again. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1590.04s)]
*  I don't know where this is going. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1592.28s)]
*  And they just snuck that one out under the dead of night. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1593.72s)]
*  But I think if Philly had been knocked down [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1596.76s)]
*  in round one, the Eagles, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1599.64s)]
*  and then people really had a chance to stare [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1601.6s)]
*  at the Sixer season with the kind of season Max is having, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1604.36s)]
*  or he's almost averaging 20 at a game. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1606.72s)]
*  Yabba Silly, they really lucked out with that. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1609.08s)]
*  And they're still, they're 20 and 34. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1611.0s)]
*  They're six and 14 in their last 20. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1613.48s)]
*  They have the 23rd net rating. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1617.3600000000001s)]
*  So they're just been a bottom 18 for, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1618.8000000000002s)]
*  you know, a good 40% of the season here. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1621.52s)]
*  They've only gotten 17 games from Embiid. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1623.72s)]
*  And yet they're only a game and a half behind Chicago [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1626.3600000000001s)]
*  for the 10th seed. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1631.2800000000002s)]
*  And Chicago doesn't wanna keep winning. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1632.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, they might stumble in anyway. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1635.0800000000002s)]
*  I don't know if Chicago wants to keep winning or not, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1637.6000000000001s)]
*  because their roster would tell you that they don't. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1640.1200000000001s)]
*  The public comments would tell you [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1643.2s)]
*  that they are attempting to. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1644.44s)]
*  So I really have no idea what to make of any of that, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1645.92s)]
*  other than the fact that, look, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1648.4s)]
*  the playing crop in the East is an absolute joke. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1650.1200000000001s)]
*  Like it is teams that are either too hurt to compete, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1652.8000000000002s)]
*  don't have the resources to actually be good teams yet, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1655.8400000000001s)]
*  or in Philly's case, a little of both. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1658.7600000000002s)]
*  Like they just are not in a competitive place [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1660.3600000000001s)]
*  by any stretch of the imagination. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1662.68s)]
*  Quentin Grimes should not be your best player. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1664.0400000000002s)]
*  Like that is not a thing that should be happening. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1665.92s)]
*  Justin Edwards should not be playing 30 minutes in a game. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1667.64s)]
*  That's not where the Sixers ever anticipated this going, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1670.44s)]
*  but it's the reality that they now have to navigate. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1674.44s)]
*  Orlando is 27 and 29 in the seventh seed, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1677.28s)]
*  and they haven't been happy with their team for two months. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1680.28s)]
*  No. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1682.52s)]
*  Atlanta is 26 and 29. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1683.3600000000001s)]
*  They're the eighth seed. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1685.3600000000001s)]
*  They made two borderline dump trades. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1686.68s)]
*  The Hunter trade and the Bogdanova's trade. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1690.0s)]
*  Those are trades you make when [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1691.68s)]
*  you don't care where your season is going. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1693.92s)]
*  They can't really dump, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1695.48s)]
*  because they don't have their first round pick. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1696.3600000000001s)]
*  But, and then you have Miami at the ninth seed, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1699.0800000000002s)]
*  25 and 28, who just like, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1702.04s)]
*  I think they'd be maybe the second worst team in the West. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1705.12s)]
*  Would you rather be Miami or Portland right now? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1708.16s)]
*  Portland is tough because they are winning themselves [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1712.04s)]
*  out of the tank race at the moment. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1714.08s)]
*  Yeah, I love it. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1715.88s)]
*  Their future is tough. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1717.0s)]
*  And we should say Philly's future [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1718.16s)]
*  in terms of their first round pick, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1720.24s)]
*  which they may or may not be able to actually keep, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1721.64s)]
*  is looking dicier by the minute. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1724.64s)]
*  They have to be very careful [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1727.4s)]
*  they don't accidentally lose that pick at this point. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1728.6s)]
*  I want to audible to that as the second thing of the six pack, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1732.7600000000002s)]
*  but before we do, the Embiid thing, do we see him again? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1736.24s)]
*  He's played 17 games, does he play 20? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1740.64s)]
*  We should not see him again. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1743.68s)]
*  Tethered to this conversation, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1746.48s)]
*  they should be actively looking at shutting Paul George down, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1748.24s)]
*  shutting Embiid down, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1751.68s)]
*  managing these injuries over the back part of the season. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1753.0800000000002s)]
*  It's time to regroup. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1756.16s)]
*  This is not going to resolve itself. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1757.68s)]
*  And even if you could limp into the play-in, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1759.3200000000002s)]
*  even if you could limp into the playoffs, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1762.16s)]
*  that is not a success for this version of this team. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1764.28s)]
*  Being an easy out in the first round [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1766.72s)]
*  is not success for the Sixers. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1768.72s)]
*  So at this point, see her into the skid, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1770.12s)]
*  lean into the failure, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1773.12s)]
*  live to fight another day, frankly. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1775.4s)]
*  The problem is making the playoffs, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1777.32s)]
*  Embiid could never play 14 games in four weeks. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1779.6s)]
*  It's never happening. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1782.92s)]
*  So even if you miraculously won both playing games, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1784.32s)]
*  I don't know where that's getting you. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1787.4s)]
*  All right, the second thing, you mentioned the draft pick. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1788.76s)]
*  I think the draft pick gets Philly's first after the top six. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1792.24s)]
*  So Philly keeps it first six spots. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1796.76s)]
*  If it's the seventh pick, OKC gets it. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1798.68s)]
*  But this is one of many things. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1802.16s)]
*  This is the all-time, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1803.92s)]
*  what the hell is happening in the first round thing. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1805.3200000000002s)]
*  It's bad shit. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1807.76s)]
*  It's either 15 or six. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1808.6000000000001s)]
*  There are so many teams. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1810.24s)]
*  There's a couple of things [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1811.24s)]
*  I can't even really figure out who gets the pick. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1812.2800000000002s)]
*  So it's about half the league. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1815.0800000000002s)]
*  OKC gets Philly's first after top six. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1816.4s)]
*  They get Utah's first after the top two, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1818.72s)]
*  so they're probably gonna keep that pick. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1820.56s)]
*  Miami gets Golden State's first [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1822.3999999999999s)]
*  if it falls out of the top 10. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1824.44s)]
*  I think that's probably happening. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1825.84s)]
*  Atlanta gets Sacramento's first [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1827.84s)]
*  if it falls out of the top 12. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1829.6399999999999s)]
*  I think that might happen. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1832.36s)]
*  The Knicks get Detroit's first [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1833.8s)]
*  if it falls out of the top 13. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1835.6399999999999s)]
*  I think that's happening. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1837.24s)]
*  So we already have four teams [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1838.6399999999999s)]
*  that are gonna give their pick to somebody else. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1840.0s)]
*  OKC gets Miami's first [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1843.0s)]
*  if they don't make the playoffs, basically. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1846.52s)]
*  So that's 50-50. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1848.56s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1849.96s)]
*  Then we have San Antonio gets Atlanta's first. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1851.08s)]
*  Utah gets Minnesota and Cleveland's first. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1853.48s)]
*  The Pelicans get the Lakers first. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1856.8s)]
*  Brooklyn gets New Orleans first, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1858.72s)]
*  Milwaukee's first, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1861.2s)]
*  and the Knicks first. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1862.9199999999998s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1864.0s)]
*  Does Brooklyn get New Orleans first? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1864.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't think they get New Orleans. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1866.96s)]
*  I think they just get Milwaukee and the Knicks. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1868.12s)]
*  All right. I'm gonna take that one out. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1870.04s)]
*  Brooklyn gets Milwaukee's first, the Knicks first. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1872.04s)]
*  Keep in the air. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1874.2s)]
*  Orlando gets Denver's first. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1875.52s)]
*  And then we have this trade where OKC can swap [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1877.84s)]
*  and get the best pick from the Clips or Houston. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1881.6s)]
*  Their choice. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1884.4399999999998s)]
*  Houston can take the second best pick [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1886.04s)]
*  and swap it to Brooklyn for Phoenix's first. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1888.36s)]
*  Phoenix, I guess, loses the pick either way. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1891.8s)]
*  And then the Clips get the worst of all of those. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1895.6799999999998s)]
*  I'm gonna figure out that sequencing in about a month. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1897.76s)]
*  Yeah. We need a visual aid. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1900.84s)]
*  We need somebody to come up with a flow chart. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1902.1999999999998s)]
*  All of those picks I laid out, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1904.84s)]
*  what is the most alarming to you for the team losing the pick? [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1906.28s)]
*  Oh, great question. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1909.88s)]
*  Atlanta? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1911.04s)]
*  The Atlanta ones are bad. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1912.1200000000001s)]
*  Because it dramatically changes how they navigate their roster, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1913.64s)]
*  what they're doing for the foreseeable future. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1917.36s)]
*  On the one hand, I think it can be silly sometimes [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1920.08s)]
*  when teams like the Bulls, who were so protected, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1923.1200000000001s)]
*  they were probably gonna keep their own pick anyway, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1925.6s)]
*  go out of their way to trade to get their own pick back. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1927.4s)]
*  It can be silly. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1930.0s)]
*  But there is so much more freedom and flexibility [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1931.52s)]
*  as a franchise when you do own your own picks. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1935.2s)]
*  Because the second they're out the door, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1937.4s)]
*  the second you lose control of when you start the clock [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1939.16s)]
*  and when you start to rebuild and when you start to reboot. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1941.96s)]
*  And that's how you get into these weird lost seasons [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1944.8s)]
*  where you're sort of languishing either in the middle [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1947.2s)]
*  of the standings or just outside the play-in, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1948.96s)]
*  accomplishing basically nothing, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1951.24s)]
*  but also losing lots of games [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1953.0s)]
*  and not getting any draft capital to result from it. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1954.44s)]
*  The Atlanta ones feel really, really rough right now. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1957.04s)]
*  One thing I was thinking with all the OKC things in play, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1960.48s)]
*  let's say they get the seventh pick from Philly. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1963.52s)]
*  And let's say they get Miami's pick [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1967.08s)]
*  because Miami's a playoff team [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1968.92s)]
*  and then they have their own pick. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1970.24s)]
*  And then they can also swap with the Quippers or Houston, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1972.32s)]
*  so that's a middle. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1975.2s)]
*  So they'll have four picks. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1976.04s)]
*  Well, they'll have three. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1977.44s)]
*  They'll have their own. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1978.44s)]
*  Oh yeah, you're right. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1979.96s)]
*  Three, including Philly's pick, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1981.16s)]
*  which could be in the seven, eight, nine range. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1983.6s)]
*  But then they have all these other picks [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1986.08s)]
*  because they have a million, kajillion picks. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1987.52s)]
*  And we've been watching this going, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1990.44s)]
*  what are they gonna do with all these picks? [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1993.08s)]
*  They already like their roster. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1995.12s)]
*  They only have a couple of spots anyway. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1996.28s)]
*  Could this be the year that they take [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1997.96s)]
*  that seventh, eighth, ninth Philly pick, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=1999.72s)]
*  if that's the pick? [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2001.56s)]
*  Add like eight picks to it [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2003.36s)]
*  and just say, give us Cooper flag. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2005.2s)]
*  Here's the all-time mother load of picks. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2007.6399999999999s)]
*  Like let's say Charlotte gets the first pick [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2010.12s)]
*  and they could just trade back like six spots [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2013.68s)]
*  out of the Cooper flag spot [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2016.96s)]
*  and just get a war chest of the all-time most picks [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2018.8799999999999s)]
*  ever in a trade from OKC, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2022.68s)]
*  just to move back six spots. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2024.1200000000001s)]
*  You'd have to have like a four hour meeting about that. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2026.1200000000001s)]
*  I feel like Cooper flag's really good. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2028.16s)]
*  I love him. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2030.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm probably the highest on him out of, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2030.96s)]
*  cause he's a big intangibles guy [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2033.76s)]
*  and I know I'm gonna overreact as we get closer to June. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2035.28s)]
*  But you'd have to really think about it [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2038.76s)]
*  cause it's not a Wim Benyama pick. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2040.24s)]
*  And if you're OKC, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2042.16s)]
*  I think you would also have to really think about it [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2043.28s)]
*  because what the funder need more than anything [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2045.3200000000002s)]
*  are cost controlled players, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2048.6800000000003s)]
*  really good players on cost controlled salaries. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2050.04s)]
*  Your roster is about to get very, very expensive [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2052.16s)]
*  very, very quickly. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2054.0s)]
*  If you could have four cost control years of Cooper flag [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2055.3199999999997s)]
*  as you are contending with the rest of this roster. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2058.72s)]
*  I'm hesitant to say this [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2062.08s)]
*  cause we haven't seen Cooper flag play in the NBA yet. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2063.56s)]
*  If he is as good as advertised, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2065.6s)]
*  that he might be the single most attractive piece [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2067.68s)]
*  to the Thunder for exactly that reason. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2070.44s)]
*  Stretch four, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2072.64s)]
*  can play some three. Runs the floor, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2074.4s)]
*  good ball skills. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2075.68s)]
*  Incredibly competitive, doesn't need the ball. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2076.52s)]
*  Checks out. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2079.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And I know whoever gets the first pick [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2080.8s)]
*  wouldn't want to trade him, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2083.48s)]
*  but there's a price for everything. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2084.48s)]
*  And there's a price to make you go, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2085.92s)]
*  holy shit, like you're going to offer me 220 cents [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2087.4s)]
*  in the dollar for this pick. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2090.84s)]
*  But I honestly think that's what OKC has to do. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2091.84s)]
*  Here's the thing though. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2094.92s)]
*  If that pick does convey and OKC gets Philly's pick, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2095.88s)]
*  six teams will have 20 picks in the first round between them. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2099.6000000000004s)]
*  OKC, one of them. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2103.76s)]
*  Brooklyn will have three picks. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2104.6800000000003s)]
*  The Spurs, the Jazz, the Magic, the Wizards [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2106.2000000000003s)]
*  will all have two picks. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2108.44s)]
*  That is an incredible consolidation of draft capital. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2110.16s)]
*  And I don't know who ends up keeping a lot of those picks [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2114.52s)]
*  and who ends up moving them on [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2117.0s)]
*  because they're clearly valuable [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2118.12s)]
*  for all of these cost-controlled reasons [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2119.2s)]
*  we've just talked about. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2120.6s)]
*  But to just help you visualize at home [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2121.44s)]
*  as you're listening to us, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2124.3599999999997s)]
*  list off all of these swaps and protections [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2125.24s)]
*  and picks that may convey. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2127.44s)]
*  Basically every single pick from 18 to 30 [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2129.0s)]
*  is going to go to a different team, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2132.04s)]
*  except for Indiana's pick and Boston's pick. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2133.64s)]
*  That's it. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2135.8399999999997s)]
*  Every other pick is probably going to change hands. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2136.68s)]
*  And that's insane. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2138.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2140.3199999999997s)]
*  And I don't even know how they fix it. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2141.16s)]
*  And Adam Silver should not be the one explaining [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2143.48s)]
*  who gets what. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2146.48s)]
*  They should maybe hire Bobby Marks just for three hours [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2147.3199999999997s)]
*  as his assistant just to be over on the side [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2151.7599999999998s)]
*  just laying out whatever. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2154.0s)]
*  Yeah, doing the touchscreen. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2154.8399999999997s)]
*  Like we have to raise pick swap literacy [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2155.68s)]
*  around the country at this point [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2158.56s)]
*  because this is becoming an epidemic. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2159.8399999999997s)]
*  Well, OKC and San Antonio, San Antonio is the other team. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2162.04s)]
*  Like if Atlanta's pick miraculously got in the top four [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2165.6s)]
*  and it got to like four, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2169.4s)]
*  San Antonio would have enough assets [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2170.88s)]
*  to really try to climb three picks. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2172.68s)]
*  So it'll come down to how generationally [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2174.92s)]
*  you think Cooper Flagg is. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2177.6s)]
*  And I don't think he's in the Wembe, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2178.84s)]
*  Anthony Davis, sure thing class. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2181.44s)]
*  You really have to believe in some other stuff. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2183.16s)]
*  I personally think there's no way he misses [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2185.7999999999997s)]
*  because how competitive he is, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2187.64s)]
*  but six, seven and a half. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2188.84s)]
*  There's things you could, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2190.92s)]
*  to me he's the perfect stretch four, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2192.32s)]
*  but we'll see. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2193.96s)]
*  All right, next thing on the six pack. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2195.52s)]
*  Speaking of the draft, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2198.76s)]
*  the Brooklyn Nets, the team that just won't tank, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2200.8s)]
*  the team that has players telling reporters, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2203.7200000000003s)]
*  hey, we're gonna try to keep winning games. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2206.64s)]
*  If you don't like it, don't root for us, which I love. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2209.28s)]
*  So they're 20 and 34. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2211.68s)]
*  They're one and a half games [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2213.4s)]
*  beyond Chicago for the 10 seed, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2214.56s)]
*  which is tied with Philly. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2217.08s)]
*  But does it feel the same as Philly to you, Rob? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2218.6s)]
*  Not even a little bit. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2221.4s)]
*  They have a great coach. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2223.2s)]
*  They made the mistake of, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2225.0s)]
*  they kept Cam Johnson and Nick Claxton, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2227.24s)]
*  but they also have D-Lo on the, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2229.16s)]
*  I'm so happy not to be on the Lakers anymore. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2230.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm gonna go nuts. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2233.0s)]
*  They're six and one in their last seven. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2234.96s)]
*  Their defense held all seven opponents to under 100, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2236.52s)]
*  seventh net rating over that time. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2239.7999999999997s)]
*  They bought out Ben Simmons, they traded Schroeder, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2241.72s)]
*  and they traded Phinney Smith, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2244.3199999999997s)]
*  and yet they're still hanging around. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2246.12s)]
*  And this was not the plan. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2247.4399999999996s)]
*  They made a trade with Houston, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2248.96s)]
*  I'm sorry, with Houston to try to get their picks back [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2251.56s)]
*  and give them Phoenix picks, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2254.68s)]
*  and they were gonna tank. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2256.4s)]
*  Now I don't know. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2258.92s)]
*  They might make the playoffs. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2259.7599999999998s)]
*  What would you do if you were running Brooklyn? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2260.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh, think of fake injury or think of playoffs? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2265.44s)]
*  I think go for it. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2268.44s)]
*  Honestly, I think go for it. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2269.48s)]
*  It's always tough in these positions, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2272.4s)]
*  and yes, I understand the long-term arguments, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2274.12s)]
*  but I'm with you that I am moved [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2276.48s)]
*  by the enthusiasm of the team. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2278.7999999999997s)]
*  I am moved by the amount of backbone [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2280.52s)]
*  they've been playing with lately, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2282.4s)]
*  and ultimately, particularly how good they've been [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2283.88s)]
*  on defense. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2285.8s)]
*  This is a team that's playing a pretty deep rotation, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2286.64s)]
*  really high energy style, forcing a lot of turnovers. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2289.56s)]
*  They can't score for shit, even now, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2292.96s)]
*  but they get a lot of stops, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2295.28s)]
*  and they play with a lot of effort. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2296.92s)]
*  And ultimately, here's the thing. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2297.96s)]
*  I say you encourage the guys to go for it, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2299.36s)]
*  and they ultimately will probably lose [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2301.76s)]
*  a lot of games anyway, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2303.44s)]
*  but you didn't pull the rug out from under them. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2304.92s)]
*  I think that's where you start to lose credibility [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2306.76s)]
*  with the players on your team [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2308.76s)]
*  is when you start actively sabotaging their efforts to win [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2309.88s)]
*  just for the sake of the lottery. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2313.92s)]
*  But if there's a way to let them run themselves out, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2315.6800000000003s)]
*  and look, if you look at the teams that they've beaten [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2319.6400000000003s)]
*  at this recent stretch of games [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2322.7200000000003s)]
*  where they've been so successful, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2323.96s)]
*  it's not exactly a murderous row. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2325.0s)]
*  They will lose games against better teams eventually, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2327.2000000000003s)]
*  but let them find their spine. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2329.44s)]
*  Let them find their style, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2331.4s)]
*  and ultimately, what can be successful for them. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2333.08s)]
*  And let Nick Claxton wake up a little bit, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2335.6400000000003s)]
*  because he had a bit of a slow start to the season. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2338.52s)]
*  These are meaningful developments for a team like Brooklyn. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2340.2s)]
*  I saw this happen a decade ago [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2343.44s)]
*  with Brad Stevens and the Celtics, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2345.28s)]
*  and we were all going nuts because we wanted them to lose. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2346.88s)]
*  But ultimately, you do build some sort of a weird DNA [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2349.04s)]
*  that you didn't just roll over, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2356.12s)]
*  which brings me to the next person on my six pack list, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2357.44s)]
*  or next team, Charlotte, who has achieved peak tank. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2360.28s)]
*  I don't know if you've looked at their box scores. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2366.1200000000003s)]
*  They tried to trade Mark Williams [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2369.2400000000002s)]
*  and couldn't get rid of him, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2371.4s)]
*  and now I guess he's just in limbo [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2372.32s)]
*  as they fight about whether that trade was legal or not. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2373.84s)]
*  Brandon Miller had surgery, which is too bad. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2376.48s)]
*  They signed Alfred Payton and Taj Gibson, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2379.52s)]
*  and both of them are playing? [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2381.96s)]
*  Both of them are playing after a minute? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2384.0400000000004s)]
*  Yeah, there's not really another option. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2385.8s)]
*  They took on Nurkic in a salary dump, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2388.44s)]
*  and Nurkic has now found his destiny, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2392.84s)]
*  where you know he'll have a 27 rebound game [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2395.56s)]
*  where they still lose by 28. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2397.76s)]
*  And then they also have LaMelo Ball, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2399.8s)]
*  who's one of the great, great stats bad team guys [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2401.32s)]
*  of the last 30 years. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2404.7200000000003s)]
*  I thought it was hilarious that people were like, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2405.92s)]
*  wow, how did he get left out of the All-Star game? [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2407.44s)]
*  He just jacks up shots and they lose. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2409.76s)]
*  He's not an All-Star. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2411.7200000000003s)]
*  That's unkind. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2412.76s)]
*  I think LaMelo is better than that. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2413.6800000000003s)]
*  I think he's better than that. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2415.56s)]
*  Was that a defensive LaMelo Ball? [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2417.96s)]
*  Look, I'm willing to go out on that particular limb. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2419.84s)]
*  I think LaMelo is, look, he is on another planet [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2422.4s)]
*  in terms of some of the things he chooses to do, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2425.48s)]
*  but has a facility with the game that not many guys have [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2428.1600000000003s)]
*  and ultimately is basically the only reason [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2431.2400000000002s)]
*  the Hornets have been anything close to solving [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2433.1600000000003s)]
*  at any point in this season. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2434.92s)]
*  So he doesn't have a lot to work with when he's out there. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2436.04s)]
*  Bigger concern for me, in addition to all of his habits [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2438.92s)]
*  and kind of the judgments he makes on the court, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2442.04s)]
*  clearly just like that, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2445.08s)]
*  cursed ankles, tough injury history. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2446.2000000000003s)]
*  If he's never gonna be consistently healthy, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2449.1600000000003s)]
*  how is he gonna consistently grow as a creator? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2451.2s)]
*  And that's a problem for a player like him. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2453.3999999999996s)]
*  Would you wanna play with him for six months a year? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2455.7999999999997s)]
*  Be honest. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2458.4399999999996s)]
*  Would you wanna be his small forward? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2460.6s)]
*  Would you wanna be Brandon Miller? [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2463.0s)]
*  Would I wanna play with anyone under the age of 25? [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2465.12s)]
*  I think the answer's probably no. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2467.6s)]
*  There is a stylistic difference between us. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2469.08s)]
*  This is the only team, I really like Charles Lee, [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2471.64s)]
*  I think he's a good coach. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2473.7999999999997s)]
*  This is the only team I don't want Cooper Flagg to go to. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2474.64s)]
*  See, I think he and Lamello could run beautifully together. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2478.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2482.4399999999996s)]
*  Anyway, they're in position to get him. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2483.2799999999997s)]
*  They're working it. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2485.6s)]
*  Next one on the six pack. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2486.9199999999996s)]
*  The Chicago Bulls putting together the finishing pieces [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2489.3199999999997s)]
*  of an epic 10 year run, starting in the 15, 16 season, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2493.72s)]
*  42 and 40, 41 and 41, 27 and 55, 22 and 60, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2497.9199999999996s)]
*  22 and 43, 31 and 41, 46 and 36 in the 22 season, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2503.88s)]
*  lost in the first round, 40 and 42, 39 and 43, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2509.84s)]
*  22 and 33 with a chance to make the play in again. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2514.2400000000002s)]
*  This is Reinsdorf's manifest destiny [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2518.0s)]
*  just to not pay the luxury tax, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2522.16s)]
*  to be somewhere near the play in, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2526.0s)]
*  to not actually be a threat, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2528.96s)]
*  to not really have a direction. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2531.48s)]
*  It's like, are they tanking or are they, [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2533.2s)]
*  like they re-signed Lonzo Ball. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2535.6s)]
*  They could have traded him for a first round pick, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2538.96s)]
*  it came out, now they kept him. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2541.04s)]
*  They have Giddy, they have Kobe White, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2543.6s)]
*  kind of like Budzelis, Vucovic is still there. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2546.12s)]
*  They overpaid Patrick Williams. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2549.8s)]
*  I don't know what this team is. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2551.24s)]
*  They don't either. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2552.76s)]
*  And this is just what we're doing [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2554.16s)]
*  in the third biggest city in America, Rob. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2555.4s)]
*  Apparently it is. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2557.68s)]
*  I get from that 10,000 foot perspective [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2559.6000000000004s)]
*  why Reinsdorf is the guy who comes up. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2561.84s)]
*  I don't wanna give Arturis Karnishvili [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2564.28s)]
*  too much cover here because I feel like [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2566.84s)]
*  Nico Harrison has done him an incredible favor. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2568.44s)]
*  Patrick Dumont has done him an incredible favor, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2570.44s)]
*  taking a lot of the airspace of the NBA right now. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2572.96s)]
*  And I think it just kind of slid under the radar [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2575.7200000000003s)]
*  that after the deadline, Karnishvili went up there, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2578.2000000000003s)]
*  had his press conference, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2581.44s)]
*  and explained that there are three different ways [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2582.88s)]
*  to build the championship team. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2584.92s)]
*  You can have two stars on it, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2586.1600000000003s)]
*  you can have three stars on it, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2587.7599999999998s)]
*  or you can have nine or 10 very good players. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2589.3199999999997s)]
*  First of all, that has literally never happened before. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2592.2s)]
*  No team has won a championship [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2594.16s)]
*  with nine or 10 very good players. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2595.6s)]
*  Not a thing. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2597.8399999999997s)]
*  Also, what qualifier isn't a very good player a star? [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2599.12s)]
*  I don't know what Threshley's talking about, but- [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2602.68s)]
*  What's better than very good? [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2605.12s)]
*  Like, great? [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2606.3999999999996s)]
*  Well, let's talk about that. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2607.24s)]
*  If it is, even if that were true, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2608.4399999999996s)]
*  even if that were what the Bulls are trying to do, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2610.2s)]
*  how many players on their current roster are very good, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2612.3599999999997s)]
*  or even like pretty good? [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2615.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't think they have one very good player. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2617.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't think Kobe White's very good. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2619.2s)]
*  I think he's good. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2620.56s)]
*  He's probably the closest. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2621.3999999999996s)]
*  Theoretical Alonso Ball might be the closest. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2622.6s)]
*  We hope Manas Muzelas can be that. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2625.12s)]
*  Vuch, some nights. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2628.16s)]
*  Very good to me is like, if my son came home from school [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2630.04s)]
*  and I said, how did your history test go? [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2634.3999999999996s)]
*  And he said, very good. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2636.8799999999997s)]
*  I'm thinking that's like an A-. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2638.8799999999997s)]
*  Very good is like really positive. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2641.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, there are no A- players on this roster. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2644.12s)]
*  I'm not even sure that like, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2646.12s)]
*  this is a roster that is scraping for solid B, [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2647.52s)]
*  B- talent right now. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2650.6s)]
*  And to the extent that it's there, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2652.3199999999997s)]
*  it's probably years away from developing. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2654.16s)]
*  They got nothing from Levine. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2656.6s)]
*  They have no extra first round capital, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2659.6s)]
*  other than this weird protected first rounder [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2662.08s)]
*  they have from Portland that they'll probably never get. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2664.2s)]
*  They have an absentee landlord as an owner. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2667.12s)]
*  I think I would take every single team [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2671.3199999999997s)]
*  in the East's future over theirs. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2673.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2675.72s)]
*  So you would take Charlottes, you would take Phillies. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2676.52s)]
*  Charlottes, Brooklyn, the Brooklyn picks. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2678.8399999999997s)]
*  Even Philly, I have Maxey and I have, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2681.3599999999997s)]
*  you know, hopefully some tradable assets [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2684.8799999999997s)]
*  and maybe Embiid will come back. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2686.7999999999997s)]
*  Maybe I can turn Embiid into something. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2688.12s)]
*  I would rather have every other roster [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2689.56s)]
*  in the East over Chicago's. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2690.9199999999996s)]
*  I don't even know what their number one asset is. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2693.24s)]
*  What a day for the Wizards. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2695.0s)]
*  You know, they had to win something eventually. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2696.2s)]
*  They won your heart, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2698.2s)]
*  at least relative to the Chicago Bulls. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2699.12s)]
*  Congratulations to the Washington Wizards. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2700.8399999999997s)]
*  Honestly, Jordan Poole's probably better [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2702.2s)]
*  than anyone on the Bulls. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2703.56s)]
*  This season. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2705.72s)]
*  That is the darkest sentence [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2706.52s)]
*  that I've ever heard someone say. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2708.08s)]
*  Jordan Poole. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2709.3599999999997s)]
*  And it might be true, I think it's true. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2710.2s)]
*  I think it's true, but it's very bleak. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2711.04s)]
*  I thought somebody should have traded for him. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2711.8799999999997s)]
*  We talked about it last week. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2713.2799999999997s)]
*  I actually think he's really figured some shit out [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2714.6s)]
*  and he's at least done it on a big stage before, but. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2717.68s)]
*  Jordan Poole's had an exceedingly. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2720.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I like Kool of Oli and Saar and Carrington. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2721.24s)]
*  They've got guys. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2723.68s)]
*  They're okay, they're gonna have cap space. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2724.6s)]
*  I'll do credit to Jordan Poole [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2728.16s)]
*  who's had an exceedingly normal NBA season. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2729.3999999999996s)]
*  And for him, for a guy that talented, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2732.04s)]
*  that's a huge step forward. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2733.72s)]
*  If I was a Chicago Bulls fan, [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2736.64s)]
*  I would be losing my mind. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2739.7599999999998s)]
*  Rightly so. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2741.7599999999998s)]
*  They're in the third biggest city in America. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2743.7599999999998s)]
*  The Celtics are about to sell for [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2745.3599999999997s)]
*  between six and six and a half billion. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2747.16s)]
*  So the Bulls are worth somewhere around there. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2750.08s)]
*  Why can't they just sell the team [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2751.8799999999997s)]
*  if they're not gonna run it correctly? [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2753.3199999999997s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2755.0s)]
*  How long can you live off the Jordan? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2755.8399999999997s)]
*  And how long can you be like, [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2757.8399999999997s)]
*  oh man, if T. Rose didn't get hurt in round one, oh man. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2758.7999999999997s)]
*  That was 13 years ago. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2762.12s)]
*  I know. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2764.0s)]
*  Last one on the six pack. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2766.52s)]
*  You wanted to talk about the Suns [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2769.04s)]
*  who have a net rating in their last 15 games of 18th. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2771.24s)]
*  Who in their last 58 games, including the playoffs, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2775.2s)]
*  are 26 and 32. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2777.44s)]
*  Who tried to trade Kevin Durant [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2779.7999999999997s)]
*  for about a week before they told him or his agent [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2782.08s)]
*  or his manager that that was even happening. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2785.16s)]
*  And now it's like, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2787.48s)]
*  yeah, this summer they're probably gonna trade KD. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2789.68s)]
*  This is grim. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2791.2799999999997s)]
*  What are you seeing? [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2793.3599999999997s)]
*  It's not as loud or as dramatic as what's going on in Philly. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2796.56s)]
*  And so yeah, they get the lead in terms of the, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2800.0s)]
*  like the dumpster fire power rankings here. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2802.3599999999997s)]
*  It's so disappointing to see the Suns in such disarray, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2806.52s)]
*  quietly sucking all this year [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2810.24s)]
*  and seeing none of the primary stakeholders of that team [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2812.04s)]
*  do a single thing to fix it. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2815.24s)]
*  This isn't ultimately like a second apron problem [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2818.44s)]
*  or a no trade clause problem. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2821.96s)]
*  Like those are obstructions, right? [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2823.3999999999996s)]
*  In terms of Phoenix making its roster better. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2824.92s)]
*  They're not obstructions for anyone on this team [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2828.2000000000003s)]
*  playing into the ball on defense. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2831.48s)]
*  They're not obstructions for anyone on this team [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2833.04s)]
*  fighting for a rebound. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2834.96s)]
*  They're not obstructions most crucially [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2835.8s)]
*  to finding some semblance of offensive flow [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2838.04s)]
*  for a super talented team on paper. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2840.36s)]
*  Like I know there is a worse than the sum of its parts [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2842.56s)]
*  thing happening here, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2845.84s)]
*  because basically none of the parts [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2847.1600000000003s)]
*  compliment each other at all. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2848.36s)]
*  It's just a lot of guys in their individual lanes, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2849.96s)]
*  not making each other better. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2852.84s)]
*  And that is a really tough watch [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2854.92s)]
*  for people like us at this stage in the season. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2857.32s)]
*  I just don't get the sense that anyone involved in it, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2859.56s)]
*  particularly participating in that offense either, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2861.52s)]
*  or participating in this season. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2863.76s)]
*  And so it's so disjointed, it's so unpleasant. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2865.28s)]
*  I really just like where the Phoenix Suns find themselves. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2868.8s)]
*  And I don't wish this on any of them. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2871.08s)]
*  This is just who they've been. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2873.56s)]
*  Well, the problem is they had a certain coach last year [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2875.32s)]
*  that they made the scapegoat for everything, Frank Bogle, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2877.6800000000003s)]
*  who won the 2020 title. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2880.2400000000002s)]
*  They brought in Coach Budd, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2883.16s)]
*  completely different philosophy. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2885.12s)]
*  He's gonna unleash these guys offensively, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2886.4399999999996s)]
*  and they're even worse. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2888.3599999999997s)]
*  But to me, it's a talent problem. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2890.04s)]
*  I was looking, right around this time, [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2891.68s)]
*  where you have like, I would say OKC Boston and Cleveland [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2895.3199999999997s)]
*  are the three best teams, right, in some order. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2898.4399999999996s)]
*  And then you think like they probably have the best rosters, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2901.3599999999997s)]
*  the nine man rotation. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2904.3999999999996s)]
*  Who would you take on a team like Phoenix? [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2907.04s)]
*  How many of their guys, other than the top two, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2909.7599999999998s)]
*  would even play for one of the top three teams? [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2911.56s)]
*  So that would be their Beal. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2914.2s)]
*  Yeah, he would. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2915.72s)]
*  I think Beal would play off the bench [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2917.24s)]
*  for at least Boston and Cleveland. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2920.2s)]
*  I don't know about OKC, maybe. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2923.64s)]
*  Who's he playing over? [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2925.12s)]
*  He would play. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2925.96s)]
*  Who's he playing over? [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2926.7999999999997s)]
*  They need somebody like him. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2927.64s)]
*  That's sort of a smart thing. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2928.68s)]
*  So you're giving them Isaiah Joe's minutes? [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2929.52s)]
*  Sure, yes. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2931.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2932.2s)]
*  I feel fine giving Bradley Beal Isaiah Joe's minutes. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2933.04s)]
*  Okay, so he's in the seven, eight, or ninth man range [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2935.4s)]
*  for the top three teams. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2939.24s)]
*  Fair? [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2940.68s)]
*  Maybe sixth on the right roster. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2941.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2943.3599999999997s)]
*  Maybe first guy off the bench. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2944.2s)]
*  First guy off the bench. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2945.3199999999997s)]
*  I would still rather bring Prichard off the bench [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2947.16s)]
*  beforehand, but that's just me. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2949.2s)]
*  Uh, Grayson Allen or Royce O'Neal, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2950.52s)]
*  do they play for any of the top three teams [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2955.0s)]
*  in the top nine of their rotations? [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2957.64s)]
*  I mean, this is kind of the Tory Craig corollary [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2961.16s)]
*  because didn't he just like just kind of crack [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2963.3999999999996s)]
*  into Boston's rotation a little bit? [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2965.16s)]
*  Tenth man. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2967.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2968.7599999999998s)]
*  Royce O'Neal can do a lot of Tory Craig things. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2970.08s)]
*  I would say slightly better than Tory Craig on balance. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2972.0s)]
*  Grayson Allen, very much an issue of how much [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2974.7999999999997s)]
*  you need his shooting. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2977.2s)]
*  And frankly, this season, whether his shot is on or not. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2978.16s)]
*  Lately, it's been looking a lot better. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2980.52s)]
*  Start the season was not there. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2982.88s)]
*  If he's streaky, he's not very viable. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2984.3199999999997s)]
*  So that's a huge problem in terms of high level competition. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2987.16s)]
*  Nick Richards? [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2990.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think he can get minutes. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2992.92s)]
*  Maybe Boston, like the Kata, the random Kata game. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2995.68s)]
*  Maybe Nick Richards, the Kata. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=2999.44s)]
*  I bring this up because it's just grim. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3001.52s)]
*  What Phoenix did with all the stuff they traded away. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3004.08s)]
*  And I defended the Durant trade when it happened, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3007.12s)]
*  or at least the idea of it. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3010.08s)]
*  Even that night, none of us understood [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3011.12s)]
*  why Kim Johnson was in it. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3012.92s)]
*  But when you're throwing in as many assets as they did, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3014.7200000000003s)]
*  but then also paralyzing themselves to trade other picks. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3017.7200000000003s)]
*  And I don't see it now. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3020.52s)]
*  And I don't really know what KD is worth this summer either. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3022.44s)]
*  That's not like a miraculous parachute out of here. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3026.08s)]
*  That's gonna be his 19th season next year. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3029.8799999999997s)]
*  What are you getting for him? [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3032.24s)]
*  Are you getting like Jalen Green and a first and a... [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3034.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3038.6s)]
*  Like what are you actually getting for Kevin Durant [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3039.44s)]
*  at this point in his career? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3041.2s)]
*  He's got one year left in his deal? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3042.68s)]
*  That's even worse than this, frankly. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3045.3599999999997s)]
*  That's the hard thing about interrogating [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3047.68s)]
*  Kevin Durant trades is the packages feel more depressing. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3049.7999999999997s)]
*  And I think the packages also force you to confront [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3053.08s)]
*  you as an organization in the Phoenix Suns [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3056.84s)]
*  have done with Devin Booker's career. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3059.08s)]
*  A player who had to come into his own, who took his time, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3060.96s)]
*  who grew as a playmaker, who grew as a creator, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3064.8s)]
*  who to be totally fair is not having an amazing season [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3066.8s)]
*  by his standards, but a good enough one, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3070.8s)]
*  a good enough Devin Booker season. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3072.76s)]
*  And if you use that whole period of time [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3074.92s)]
*  and you have one trip to the finals [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3077.6s)]
*  in a somewhat weird Western Conference field, [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3079.7200000000003s)]
*  and that's it, that's the primary feather [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3082.04s)]
*  in the cap of the Devin Booker era, [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3086.28s)]
*  that's really sad, honestly, for a star [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3089.0400000000004s)]
*  who's had this kind of long lasting relationship [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3091.6000000000004s)]
*  with the team, like you would hope that a player [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3093.44s)]
*  like that would be rewarded with better. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3096.6400000000003s)]
*  How many teams did Luca fuck up during his career [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3099.1600000000003s)]
*  in the maps? [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3102.92s)]
*  Yeah, the Suns definitely. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3103.96s)]
*  Because that game seven definitely like [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3104.8s)]
*  was some sort of weird cat house with the Suns. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3106.92s)]
*  Yep. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3109.52s)]
*  The Minnesota, the fact that they beat Minnesota, [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3110.36s)]
*  I think led to, I don't know if they trade towns [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3113.8s)]
*  if they make the finals. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3115.88s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3117.08s)]
*  Then Dallas themselves, that's another one. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3118.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3122.6s)]
*  So there's already, there's three with the blood [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3123.6400000000003s)]
*  on his hands. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3125.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, the Phoenix thing feels like a wrap. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3126.48s)]
*  We have not heard a laugh from Ishby lately. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3128.92s)]
*  No. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3130.76s)]
*  There are no fixes, and then they're in a conference [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3131.84s)]
*  where this can't happen. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3133.92s)]
*  We're gonna have San Antonio coming. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3135.28s)]
*  OKC's already there, Yokeage, you're going down the line. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3137.2400000000002s)]
*  It's like there's, this is it. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3140.08s)]
*  They have the toughest remaining strength of schedule [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3142.08s)]
*  of any team in the league. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3144.48s)]
*  They're not gonna make it. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3146.6400000000003s)]
*  Well, the sad thing is Brooklyn had a few of those picks [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3149.0400000000004s)]
*  that they gave back to Houston to get their pick back [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3152.36s)]
*  so they could tank, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3155.28s)]
*  and now they're not even tanking correctly. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3156.1200000000003s)]
*  But those Phoenix picks are looking pretty juicy. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3158.6000000000004s)]
*  Before we wrap up the six pack, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3161.44s)]
*  San Antonio, when do they throw the flag into this season? [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3164.5200000000004s)]
*  They're just far enough away that you could talk me into it. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3168.48s)]
*  What does throwing in the flag look like? [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3171.88s)]
*  Ah, some Wembee rest management. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3175.32s)]
*  Some Wembee, hey, we need to sit him down for three games. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3179.32s)]
*  We're worried about some fake tendonitis [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3182.44s)]
*  and some fake part of his body. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3184.6000000000004s)]
*  I'm not sure they need to do that. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3186.56s)]
*  I think they're gonna be, again, perfectly fine [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3189.04s)]
*  coasting out, losing some of these games. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3191.6800000000003s)]
*  Now, if the Fox thing catches on in such a huge way [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3193.88s)]
*  where it's unavoidable, then yeah, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3196.7200000000003s)]
*  maybe you have that discussion, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3198.84s)]
*  but part of trading for De'Aaron Fox [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3199.96s)]
*  is accelerating at least a little bit. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3202.64s)]
*  And I think ultimately, their position is not so much [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3204.56s)]
*  tethered to their own pick, right? [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3207.7999999999997s)]
*  It's tethered to the other draft capital that they have. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3209.3999999999996s)]
*  It's tethered to the guys they already have on roster. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3211.3199999999997s)]
*  So I don't think they necessarily need to. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3213.24s)]
*  Counter? [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3216.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3217.72s)]
*  Portland could pretty easily pass them. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3219.2799999999997s)]
*  They could be the third worst team in the West. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3221.3199999999997s)]
*  And they would be either four, five, or six teams [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3224.3199999999997s)]
*  worse than them in the East. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3228.2s)]
*  They could be in the six to nine range with that draft pick, [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3229.2799999999997s)]
*  which puts you in lottery mode. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3232.6s)]
*  I actually really thought that they were gonna make [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3235.3599999999997s)]
*  a little bit of a run and they just can't. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3237.2s)]
*  I thought Boston really exposed some of the issues with them. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3239.24s)]
*  I don't know if you watched that game. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3241.8799999999997s)]
*  They attacked Limby in a really unique way [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3243.68s)]
*  that I haven't seen teams do before. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3246.3199999999997s)]
*  And just in general, it just looked like [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3249.16s)]
*  two different classes of teams. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3251.3199999999997s)]
*  And then you think the Warriors got better. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3253.2s)]
*  I don't really see the path for them. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3256.08s)]
*  Anything else you wanna hit before we go? [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3257.68s)]
*  I think we covered a lot of it. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3259.4s)]
*  We covered every mid to terrible team [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3260.3599999999997s)]
*  in the Eastern Conference, it feels like. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3263.16s)]
*  So we really gave the people what they want today. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3264.6s)]
*  Well, that's it for today's six pack. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3267.04s)]
*  But if that's not enough for you, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kowAhkaV47g&t=3268.48s)]
