# Is the NBA Product More or Less Valuable Than We Think? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPUZw1OA8Jw)
*  All right.
*  The king of substack, Ethan Sherwood Strauss is here.
*  What's it like to be the king of substack?
*  Is there like a crown?
*  What do you get?
*  You get a mug.
*  So that's nice.
*  They send you a mug and I got some swag.
*  I just stopped by the substack offices and I got a onesie for the baby, a few hoodies.
*  Yeah.
*  Congrats.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm like King Todd over here.
*  It's very impressive.
*  That's great.
*  Well, you should check out his substack if you haven't read it.
*  He has some always interesting thoughts about sports and especially basketball.
*  Sometimes I disagree with you.
*  I'll text you when I disagree.
*  I'm like, I just disagree with what you wrote there.
*  I asked you what is a topic that we could talk about and we settled on.
*  Is the NBA more or less valuable than people seem to think it is because this has been.
*  I've heard people going hard both ways and sometimes there's an agenda when people are
*  going hard, but they're about to do this new deal.
*  I was on Matt Bellamy's podcast last week, making predictions for it.
*  I think there's going to be three suitors, not two.
*  I think they're probably going to at least double the total number of money they got,
*  which doesn't necessarily mean they got doubled the amount of money.
*  There's some, some thoughts on that.
*  No, no, it's not actually double.
*  It's a little, but ultimately the interest is pretty good
*  for a league that, you know, you could kind of pick apart in some ways.
*  You could say, Oh, who is their best under 30 player?
*  What's going to, um, where do you land on this topic or do you want to talk it out?
*  Well, I think it's a fascinating topic because it's almost a paradox.
*  I wrote in 2022, a story about the NBA called half the audience, twice the profits.
*  It looks like it's going to be maybe even more than twice the profits.
*  It is as a share of the television audience, a less popular property than it was before.
*  But at the same time, because of the crazy machinations in media and the fact that it's
*  still popular enough, it is, I guess, increasingly valuable.
*  And then it's got this weird value bill.
*  I would call it the Ben Thompson theory.
*  Ben Thompson has been a fantastic guest on your program where you would think one would think
*  as these cable, as these cable companies, as ESPN, as Turner, as they lose more and more
*  subscribers, as they go from a hundred million people to 70 million people that they would pay
*  not as much money for sports rights.
*  But the weird thing about it is it increases this desperation, totally counterintuitive
*  where they pay even more because they have less of an audience.
*  It is a bizarre business.
*  Well, and then on top of it, here's the part.
*  I don't know what the right answer is, but I've heard both sides of it.
*  Ratings are going down.
*  Less people are interested in basketball based on the viewing audience of basketball,
*  which mirrors a lot of the viewing audience of network TV, things like that.
*  But when Derek Thompson came on and we talked about some version of this and he was saying,
*  I am a diehard basketball fan who doesn't watch basketball that much, but I love
*  the whole circus of basketball.
*  I love listening to podcasts about it.
*  I like consuming the highlights of it.
*  And I was saying that's basically my son.
*  My son barely ever watches basketball with me, but knows what's going on,
*  knows who all the players is, has an Anthony Edwards opinion,
*  and is just basically getting this through.
*  So in some ways, the NBA fits in better than it ever has in whatever weird culture we've created.
*  Way better than baseball.
*  Mike Trout went out for maybe the year and people were like,
*  I don't know what Mike Trout looks like.
*  And whereas basketball, it's just constant, constant.
*  When you get to the Olympics, they're going to be some of the most famous people there.
*  But yet the results aren't there from a who's watching standpoint.
*  And yet they would go, but look at our social, look at us on YouTube, look at us on Snapchat,
*  like any other big picture variable from 2020s.
*  We're doing great.
*  I don't know what to believe.
*  It's this weird thing where it's almost like there's this secondary market of yourself
*  when it comes to a media property where I have all these opinions on some of the NBA player podcasts,
*  but similar to your kids, I've never actually sat down and listened to a full Jeff Teague podcast.
*  I've seen all these clips on social media and on YouTube,
*  and I guess basketball has more of a secondary market of itself than these other sports.
*  And then there's this other aspect of it that's hard to quantify, which is
*  how much do the personalities involved matter?
*  How much do these companies want to be affiliated with the brand of the NBA,
*  which is a cooler brand as they see it to maybe even a more popular sport like college football.
*  The reaction when college football signed its playoff deal was a lot of people going,
*  wow, that's not for as much money as I thought.
*  College football is having a moment.
*  More and more people are watching it.
*  But I don't know if college football is necessarily something that is as alluring
*  as being connected to the NBA if you're Amazon, for instance.
*  And I don't know how you see these things.
*  You're higher up in the business world than I am.
*  Oh, thanks, Ethan.
*  You know, people know.
*  But the older I get, the more I come to the conclusion that a lot of these deals
*  are driven more by personality than I would have thought,
*  and less economic imperative than I would have thought.
*  We have two other big factors coming, right?
*  The expansion teams are coming the moment this deal gets done, right?
*  And the expansion prices are going to be huge.
*  The values of the franchises have also gone up partly because of the meteorite deal.
*  So they can point to these different things and say,
*  I mean, look at the money we just got from our three new TV partners.
*  Look at the money we're going to get from these expansion teams.
*  How could you not say we're doing well?
*  I'm in the camp of they are doing well.
*  But I also see some of the stuff that you've written about
*  where you're like, whoa, football said, oh, you like Christmas?
*  Cool.
*  We're taking it.
*  Like, that's it.
*  Oh, Martin Luther King weekend that Monday.
*  Oh, you're going to make that your day.
*  Cool.
*  We're going to take that too.
*  And they're just like taking days by force that matter of the NBA.
*  And the NBA even retreated from Thursday, which was the holy day for regular seasons.
*  Thursday, Chuck and Kenny and Ernie and a doubleheader.
*  And football blew that out of the water.
*  They were treated at Tuesdays until football's gone.
*  So you see some stuff like that and you're like, well, they're not even
*  remotely in the same vicinity as football.
*  Yeah, it's crazy.
*  I think in 2016, they do those top 100 sports TV events of the year.
*  And back then, I believe the NBA had 12 in the top 50.
*  And I can't quite recall how many they had in the top 25,
*  but they had a significant amount in the top 25.
*  That was Curry versus Lebron in the finals, but also Curry versus KD in Westbrook in the
*  Western Finals.
*  Yeah, that was a good season.
*  Yeah, it was an era of the NBA that was a very cool era.
*  And now that list comes out every year and the NBA is just not even the top 100.
*  It's just not even there.
*  They're bounced from the top 50.
*  So it represents how the NFL on a relative basis has just taken more territory relative
*  to the other leagues, including, as you mentioned, Christmas, where the NFL goes,
*  it's ours now.
*  And they've almost taken this.
*  Yes, it's ours.
*  It's done.
*  I think Goodell said something like I don't have to ask permission when he was asked about it.
*  But at the same time, what's so crazy, Bill, is that if we look at the past decade,
*  I believe when this deal was signed, by the time the ink is dry,
*  the NBA TV rights would have gone up by a greater percentage than the NFL TV rights.
*  So as much as Adam Silver might have made this or that misstep, maybe he's just a much better
*  negotiator with these rights deals than Roger Goodell is.
*  And maybe Roger Goodell is looking at the situation and wondering, hey, what's up with
*  this?
*  We are the NFL.
*  We're getting 10 billion a year.
*  The NBA is going to get six or seven.
*  And we're the NFL.
*  What the hell happened?
*  Yeah, well, it's timing is what happened.
*  Sometimes you get timing at the perfect points of whenever your contract is up or your deal is up.
*  I think about baseball.
*  Baseball struck with all those RSNs at the perfect time.
*  I forget how many years ago that was.
*  And something that might have happened to baseball anyway didn't happen because of the
*  RSN money and because of how badly each RSN or whatever was needed baseball and needed
*  162 games.
*  We'd always hear baseball literally eats up innings.
*  Well, now that model is going away and baseball is in a completely different spot, especially
*  with people under 25.
*  And we've been talking about this for how many years?
*  Since really the mid 2000s.
*  But now it's finally coming home.
*  And even I forget who always has fun with this on Twitter, but the Sunday morning baseball package,
*  which was on Peacock last year and baseball is like, we're shopping this.
*  And then it's like, Roku is like, we'll take it.
*  And now they have some national game that's earlier than all the other Sunday games.
*  It's like, cool.
*  I don't I'd never watch a game that's not the Red Sox.
*  I'm not even watching the Red Sox right now.
*  So I, you know, I, in some cases where you feel like, man, you got super lucky with the timing
*  that, which I do feel like is the case with basketball.
*  But on the other hand, I think basketball is much better suited for wherever things are going
*  than baseball is, right?
*  Yeah.
*  And I also think, you know, one of my subscribers wrote into me, because I've been talking about
*  this whole distinction between event sports and inventory sports and how the NFL is an event sport.
*  It's a big event.
*  And my contention is when it comes to holding popularity in this culture, there's so much noise,
*  so many options.
*  You want to be an event sport.
*  You want to be like the UFC.
*  You want to be like the NFL.
*  You want to be like college football.
*  But the guy wrote into me and he said, you know, you're not really giving the inventory it's due
*  here.
*  This is what's enabled the NBA to sell off different pieces of itself.
*  So maybe the lesson is that baseball, that's too much inventory sport.
*  That's too much inventory.
*  You've gone crazy with it.
*  You're getting lost in the shuffle.
*  You're just part of the background of life right now.
*  The NBA has had some of that and its regular season has waned.
*  But the amount of inventory it has combined with enough eventiness of its playoffs and its cultural
*  appeal and what you're talking about, where it's popular in the secondary way, it just allows the
*  NBA to sell off pieces of itself.
*  I thought ESPN, based on the reporting, seems like it's gotten a really good deal in this whole
*  negotiation.
*  But then the NBA still has yet more pieces of itself to sell off.
*  And it almost creates this desperation bid between some companies that might be on the come,
*  might be on the make, and a company like Warner Brothers, which is desperate, might go belly up
*  if it seeds the property.
*  So the right mix, the Goldilocks of event and inventory for the NBA perhaps.
*  Well, somehow the NBA pulled off basically doubling the amount of money they're getting for
*  these packages from a place like ESPN.
*  But ESPN is getting less in the deal.
*  That's been a lot of the reporting this week where ESPN might just give up Fridays.
*  ESPN's always had Wednesdays, Fridays, they've had a Saturday night game, they've had some Sunday
*  games, and they're just going to get less of that because that has to get spread around.
*  But they're so desperate to still be involved in it, they're like, all right, fine.
*  And that's my question with TNT.
*  And Bella and I talked about that a little bit last week because I think Warner's going to get
*  bounced from this.
*  I think that's how it's going to play out.
*  I think it's going to be NBC slash Peacock combined with Amazon will basically get what we
*  know as the Warner side and ESPN will give up a little bit to throw into that package.
*  I don't know if Warner wanted to pay double what they were paying to get less stuff.
*  It's like, if we're going to do that, are we still getting a conference finals every year?
*  It's like, no, we're not sure about that anymore.
*  I'm like, well, fuck that.
*  We don't want to do that.
*  Yeah.
*  But when you have people over a barrel, that's when you can get them to do whatever.
*  I personally think it's an absolute catastrophe for Warner if they don't keep basketball
*  because what are they at that point?
*  Yeah.
*  It's like one of those Daryl Morey poison pill contracts from back in the day.
*  Oh yeah, the Omar Asik.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  NBC has put them into the Omar Asik kind of situation where you're damned if you do,
*  you're damned if you don't.
*  They're not a big company relative to these other bidders.
*  Now you're seeing the strangeness of David Zaslav who runs WBD.
*  They're putting them on the TV during these playoff games and he's waving
*  and he's next to a Lloyd Bankfein or flying of Goldman Sachs.
*  It's almost like he's trying to say, look, I've got great credit.
*  If we pay for these rights, we're not going to go belly up.
*  Hey, if you want to get recklessly speculative,
*  I wonder if NBC, Comcast put them in this position because there are rumors that
*  Comcast would like to buy Warner Brothers and maybe this is the thing that
*  puts them towards the brink of bankruptcy.
*  Oh wow, like they're cutting their legs out.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm just getting a little bit wild, a little bit succession-esque plot when I throw that out
*  there, but that's one of the rumors you hear bandied about.
*  It is a crazy situation for them at Turner where it looks like they can't afford this,
*  but it looks like they also can't afford not to do it.
*  You wonder to get back to this, how much of this is personality driven?
*  How much of this is that Zaslav of Warner?
*  He said, we don't need the NBA a few years ago.
*  He would suck that one back into his mouth and not have it live in the air.
*  Yeah.
*  I will now you see him at the games during this rights negotiation.
*  Like, I love the NBA.
*  Yeah, it's great.
*  You know, the other thing, there's another piece of this that there's so many things
*  going on.
*  This is why I want to do a segment when we have another, we're going to talk about
*  refs in a second, but what's happening with the league sanctioned networks, which is also
*  a piece of this because they haven't reported this yet, but my guess is NBA TV is just going to
*  probably cease to exist at some point, or it will just become a highlight thing or
*  it'll morph into NBA.com, which is already kind of happening.
*  But you think about it, I remember when I was at Grantland and the WWE launched their WWE
*  channel and they're like, we're bypassing all these people.
*  We're going to own our shit ourselves.
*  And it was like the final level of the RSNs.
*  It's like, whoa, they're going to, the pay-per-views are going to be on there.
*  What?
*  You're not going to have, and then as soon as things shifted where the rights became
*  more valuable than owning your own stuff, they were also the first one to shift and be like,
*  Hey, Netflix, Hey Fox, Hey Peacock.
*  And they started selling their content.
*  I think we're watching what's happening with the NFL network where they're just gutting it.
*  They ask them the ability anytime they want to sell a game for it seems like between 75 million
*  and a hundred million anytime they want, which at some point there's a law of diminishing
*  returns with having the NFL network and the fees you get from that, from the cable systems versus
*  Hey Amazon, do you want five more games or seven more games?
*  And I think that's also happening with NBA and the NBA.
*  Like we've had all these playoff games on NBA TV.
*  Why?
*  Yeah.
*  What's the point of that?
*  Like they could have sold those games a week ago.
*  If there's some NBA TV game this week, they could have sold it to Amazon just to say,
*  fuck it.
*  Why not?
*  I'm sure they have deals and there's stuff that makes it, but don't you feel like that model is
*  about to be past tense?
*  Definitely.
*  And I think it's, it sounded good to them back in the day and maybe it had a little
*  spark of life way back in the day when Gary Payton and Chris Weber and Ahmad Rashad on the NBA TV
*  studio set glorious days.
*  Oh, it was just wonderful.
*  That's a bygone era, but yeah, sometimes you don't want to make all of your own stuff.
*  I once saw somebody figure out how to make their own chicken sandwich from scratch.
*  And I mean farming and I mean raising the chicken and what the total amount of chicken
*  what the total cost is and everything else.
*  I feel as though these leads.
*  Was it Tom Brady?
*  Who was it?
*  I think it was just a guy, but maybe that could be a secondary career for Tom Brady after the roast.
*  But I think for them, they realized that this is actually difficult and you need an
*  infrastructure.
*  And you saw that with NBA TV.
*  They brought in Turner to do it for them because it's just not something that's easy to do
*  yourself.
*  And as you're talking about, if you're trying to sell these games, I mean, that's really
*  what it's all about.
*  I don't know if this term is ever going to catch on, but after Peacock had that NFL
*  playoff game and made some money off of it, I call it the peacockification of sports where
*  and it sucks for the consumer.
*  I think we're just going to see the cockification.
*  The cockification.
*  The consumer is certainly getting cockified as they're paying a fee here and a fee there,
*  in order to see a playoff game.
*  But that definitely seems to be in the offing, especially if NBC has rights where, yeah,
*  there's going to be a really big playoff game that you want to watch that's going to be on Peacock
*  and you're going to sign up and either you'll be a committed Peacock customer or you'll forget
*  about it and you'll just keep on paying the sub fees.
*  And that's what they're counting on.
*  Also a fascinating way to find out how intense your audience is both for the product and for
*  teams.
*  Yeah.
*  Nick's Pacers game five only available on Peacock guys.
*  Okay.
*  What do we got?
*  Who's signing up?
*  How many people are from the tri-state area?
*  How many people are from Indiana?
*  And then they study all that data and they're like, whoa, that really drove our audience in
*  New York.
*  So then the NFL looks at that and goes, it did?
*  Oh, we'll put a Giants game on there.
*  And then you kind of go.
*  But I just feel, especially as everybody, all these big companies, they're trying to
*  get sleeker and sleeker.
*  You have like a league like the NFL, 32 owners.
*  They just want to, they just want checks for stuff.
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  Like when the NBA expands and it's $9 billion for the two teams and each NBA owner splits
*  $300 million.
*  It's like, here's your check.
*  $300 million.
*  Whoa, thank you.
*  I appreciate it.
*  Same thing for these games.
*  Peacock's like, there's 90 million for the Tuesday game after Martin Luther King day.
*  Great.
*  How much is that?
*  It's two and a half million.
*  Oh, thank you.
*  And that's what they care about.
*  So I think they're going to dump these channels.
*  Yeah, I think that's what's going to happen.
*  And it's an indication of why Adam Silver apparently was renewing his contract a few
*  months ago.
*  Ultimately, it's about the money.
*  And while I've certainly been critical of some of the things the league has done, I
*  don't like how they've handled the All-Star game.
*  I love the new prison ballification of the NBA, but that's maybe for later on in the
*  conversation.
*  Ultimately, for the owners, it's about the money.
*  It's about the embedded growth principle.
*  And Adam Silver appears to have made it rain.
*  And it seems like he has really put the screws to David Zaslav and he has found the
*  necessary leverage during a rather chaotic moment for the league.
*  So what a decade for the NBA.
*  Yeah.
*  And we were going to get to this point that I mean, I'm old enough to remember like
*  when Nolan Ryan signed for a million dollars a year, there was either Sports Illustrator
*  or Inside Sports had one of those covers and it was million dollar players and the
*  salaries getting too high.
*  It was like in 1979, 1980, somewhere in that stretch.
*  And we had million dollar players.
*  And it seemed like I was a little kid.
*  It seemed like so much money.
*  Like this guy's making a million dollars a year.
*  It seemed like, you know, we had no context with it.
*  Now you think less than 50 years later, 45 years later, once the salary cap kicks in
*  the way it's going to kick in, we're going to have a hundred million dollar NBA player
*  over the next decade, right?
*  Because there's only 12 to 15 players on a team.
*  So if the salary cap is going to the amount of money that goes to the players is going
*  up by 7% every year for eight, nine, 10 years, that's going to lead to somebody signing
*  a $750 million five year deal, something like that.
*  That's where we're heading.
*  Which I think is great.
*  Kudos to them, but I'll be really interested to see how the fans respond to that.
*  I mean, it's a good bulwark against the John T Porter situation.
*  If all the players, if all the players are making at the baseline bottom, 30 million
*  a year, then you're not going to have any of that funny business.
*  And I guess the details are negotiating right now.
*  It's about whether Anthony Edwards will be a hundred million dollar player or Nas Reed
*  will be a hundred million dollar player.
*  So there's going to be sticker shock.
*  There's certainly going to be sticker shock.
*  I think as far as the owners and everybody else within that business, they're going to
*  be very happy with the results.
*  Now what it means for the NBA's future and how popular it's going to be.
*  I mean, that's more stuff for people like ourselves who care about its cultural impact
*  and its cultural imprint.
*  And I think that's more up in the air.
*  Well, here's, I mean, I did this at the top of the pod, but if ant becomes the guy,
*  you can't even put a price on what that means to the league.
*  Like if he legitimately becomes the guy, they don't have anybody under 30 who totally fits
*  that bill.
*  And we were in that situation in the late nineties, early two thousands where they
*  were dying for anybody to take over.
*  And then it kind of eventually became some combination of Kobe and Shaq and Kobe and
*  LeBron.
*  And then they figured it out as the decade went along.
*  If the ant becomes the guy that that makes a lot of this a lot easier.
*  Having a signature guy that everybody knows and cares about wanting to see if they make
*  the playoffs every year.
*  The other piece we didn't mention how they included the WNBA in the deal and didn't
*  split it out.
*  And the, I asked some people, you know, involved in this, like, why are they doing it that
*  way?
*  And the NBA's theory was if we include the WNBA and you have to, and you basically have
*  to have all of it for us, that's 320 days a year of basketball.
*  Like you're adding the NBA and then all WNBA stuff.
*  I mean, way back in the day, back when I used to make fun of the WNBA, we always felt like
*  it was being force fed to us like broccoli.
*  And it was two different audiences.
*  And I don't know if it's two completely different audiences anymore.
*  Oh, it poisoned the relationship, the early relationship between the NBA and ESPN because
*  the executive over there at ESPN, I'm trying to remember if it was Shapiro, he was mad at
*  David Stern.
*  He didn't want Stern to force the WNBA upon him.
*  He said, look, we like women's college basketball, but people are not watching this.
*  And Stern was furious and he was livid.
*  And he tried to go over, he tried to go over, I think Shapiro's head with Eiger.
*  And it was just a really toxic relationship on the basis of that aspect of the WNBA.
*  Now with Caitlin Clark, I mean, there is some legitimate interest there.
*  And it's almost some of the stars they already had that you could feel it changing the last
*  couple of years.
*  And then I think Caitlin's going to be the catalyst for it to blow up.
*  I mean, I think there's a potential of that.
*  There's certainly a lot of interest in that happening.
*  I don't know.
*  I was so fascinated by when Klosterman was on your podcast and he was wondering if we're
*  about to see the shift that happened with the NBA where college basketball was bigger.
*  And then the NBA became bigger than college basketball as basketball professionalized.
*  If something is going to happen like that with women's basketball, where it will go
*  from more popular college to finally the WNBA will make that leap and overtake.
*  I don't think so, but that potential is there.
*  I almost wish they broke out the WNBA rights just so I could just see where they're at.
*  Right.
*  And see who was desperate enough to overpay for it.
*  Which is always the case with all of these sports rights come up.
*  There's always somebody who really, really, really, really needs it.
*  And we're going to post basketball.
*  UFC is going to be the next one.
*  And UFC is just sitting there like, guys, please knock yourself out bidding on this
*  basketball one because whoever doesn't get this is going to need us.
*  At that point, Warner is going to need them.
*  That's the one I think Netflix is waiting for.
*  And we just saw it with the Brady roast.
*  Netflix wants these live events that are in and out.
*  They don't care about the inventory as much as what you were talking about earlier.
*  They want like splash.
*  And UFC is splash every four Saturdays.
*  Huge things they can put on there, blow it out, put Netflix stars around the octagon,
*  the whole thing.
*  I think it makes way more sense for them.
*  WNBA, they can't, they haven't figured out the schedule.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that's the killer for them is that basically the part that would really resonate
*  when basketball is gone that like eight weeks by the time football comes back,
*  now all of a sudden you're going against football and it just feels like the
*  playoffs get lost in a way that I don't know how they fix it.
*  It's like a jigsaw puzzle, right?
*  There might not be a way to fix it.
*  Yeah.
*  I think the issue structurally with the WNBA is that it is a subsidiary of the NBA.
*  And therefore it's hard to figure out what's unique about yourselves because there's so much
*  pattern off of the parent company.
*  I would have liked to have seen the WNBA try to be dramatically different,
*  try to have a way different schedule, frankly, try to do some of the wackier,
*  Adam Silver, big ideas, but it just didn't seem to happen that way.
*  It just, I mean, except for the one thing, the one thing they should have done,
*  and maybe there's still time to do that they didn't do from the outset,
*  is just use the same team names.
*  Like why force people to learn about the fever?
*  Why not just have the W Pacers?
*  I think that makes it so much easier to just resonate and cut across.
*  Oh, like how they're in college where it'd be like the lady Gamecocks.
*  I think they're close to figuring this out,
*  but I wonder if the season should start before college basketball or during college basketball.
*  And then they have the hockey model where like college basketball ends and the players just
*  come right into a season.
*  Or do you stagger it where it's like two halves?
*  There's got to be some way where the season peaks when there's no NBA, no NFL,
*  and that's how they win.
*  They would argue that we're growing anyway, and there's people want multiple options,
*  but I think it's interesting.
*  Women's college basketball took off basically by targeting those days
*  when there was no men's college basketball, right?
*  That Friday final four became this event and they had it forever.
*  But I think once they really honed in on that and then Sundays,
*  and it was always they were never competing against too much.
*  And that was, I think, what tipped it.
*  And now to me, it's like all one thing.
*  Like you get to that final four weekend, it's just four straight days of basketball,
*  and it's awesome.
*  Well, they've got an opportunity to make it all one thing like you're saying,
*  where you can just build momentum from the college to the pro.
*  The NBA has this weird problem where they have, in theory, a free farm system in college basketball,
*  but they've also got a competing business.
*  And it's somehow both things and it goes against them.
*  And they don't have that advantage that football has.
*  Football is the beautiful model where on Saturdays, we've got the college product,
*  and on Sundays, we've got the pro product, and one will help the other and flow into the other.
*  The NBA is in an awkward place with this where they don't care.
*  They're bathing in money currently, but they tried to make G League Ignite work,
*  and they tried to replace the college basketball pipeline.
*  And they were not able to do that.
*  So yeah, I think there's actually an easier pathway to making women's college basketball
*  work for the WNBA than right now there is for college basketball to work for the NBA.
*  You're right.
*  I just, I wonder, so this ties into another passion point of mine that I know you and I
*  both talked to Steve Kerr about the shorter NBA season.
*  And I wonder if, like if you're going to basically align the WNBA and the NBA from
*  a selling rights standpoint, it would make sense to me to make the WNBA kind of lead
*  into the NBA season.
*  So you have the playoffs and the finals.
*  Basically, that's like late September to October.
*  And then the basketball start, the NBA starts like late October, early November,
*  something like that with a 72 game schedule instead of an 82 game schedule.
*  The thing I don't get about the 82 game schedule is that literally nobody wants it.
*  Not one person.
*  And when you talk to people about it, they're just like, yeah, it's too much money.
*  That's it.
*  But you're just getting so much fucking money from this new deal.
*  This is the time to go to 72 games.
*  Yes, it should be seized upon as an opportunity.
*  I don't know if they care enough to do it, but it should.
*  And it is crazy, Bill, this whole thing where ESPN and TNT are both, I mean,
*  ESPN, it almost seems like, look, we will pay you more money, but we want less product.
*  There is something so paradoxical to that.
*  It's almost like we just want the good stuff from you.
*  We care about the conference finals.
*  We want that.
*  We care about the NBA finals.
*  We want that one game a week, but we don't want all of it.
*  We don't want all of the inventory.
*  We want enough to be able to tell people that you've got to pay a sub fee because
*  we've got the NBA.
*  That's what we want.
*  And then we want the tent pole, the big event that people are going to see because it's a huge game,
*  but we don't want all of it.
*  So there is this question of how do you make the regular season really work?
*  I don't think they're going to do it, but are you aware of the Kevin Arnovitz model?
*  And if you are, then how do you feel about it?
*  Tell me what it is.
*  It is a proposal that some within the league like.
*  It was proposed by Kevin Arnovitz, who is at ESPN.com back in the day.
*  I know.
*  I know you know.
*  I'm explaining to the listener who you should know who Kevin is because he's a fantastic writer.
*  You might or might not agree with his whole big idea, but it would be a 44 game NBA season,
*  Oh, twice a week, regular schedule, something like Tuesday and Thursday.
*  And maybe you've got some sort of big one game showcase on the weekend.
*  And the whole idea would be to eventize the NBA where if you're an NBA fan, you know exactly
*  when your team is playing, you know, they're playing in the way you do with the NFL.
*  Personally, I feel like the model, though it sounds radical, I think it would make the NBA
*  just huge.
*  It would just make it more popular.
*  I also know why it won't happen because they're getting a bunch of money anyway.
*  So why take a big risk?
*  Yeah, but you could have a modified version of that.
*  If you cut to 72, like they're going to go to two more teams.
*  So it'd be 32 teams.
*  You do four, 18 divisions, right?
*  So you play everyone in the other conference twice.
*  That's 32 games.
*  Then you play everyone in your conference three times.
*  So that's 15, 15 games total.
*  That's 45.
*  So that gets you to 77, right?
*  77 is at least better than 82.
*  But now if we wanted to do now, we could actually go a little lower than that.
*  Now it's like you play everybody in the other division, your conference, two times.
*  That's 16.
*  Now I'm at 48.
*  Then I play everybody in my division three times.
*  That's another 21.
*  Now I'm at 69.
*  In the 69 game schedule, which would be hilarious.
*  People get a lot of jokes out of that, but somewhere between 69 and 77 feels like the
*  right number.
*  And I just think about like the plan, how we kind of engage with the NBA around, I don't
*  know, like three weeks left.
*  Like, oh shit, Golden State might not make the playoffs.
*  To be able to speed that up a little sooner with more stakes and like, if you have one
*  injury, that could really matter.
*  You know, I just think it would make the league more interesting, but they're not going to
*  listen to us.
*  They might, but they probably won't, but they might in that case, because that's not
*  a huge sacrifice to get there.
*  And there is some proof of concept.
*  The most watched NBA season post Jordan, and I don't think anybody would have anticipated
*  it was the lockout season of 2010, 2011, I think.
*  No, the 1112 that season was awesome.
*  66 games.
*  And it was like, it was actually just hoops every night.
*  It was great.
*  Yeah.
*  And there was no rollout.
*  You couldn't promote it.
*  They hastily put together their greatest ad, which the, I want to be with you forever
*  or whatever it was with the bad CGI that still had an emotional impact merging the players
*  from yesteryear with the players today.
*  But the crazy thing about it is when baseball had its strike, it took a huge dip in popularity,
*  but the NBA had something equivalent.
*  And because I believe they had fewer games, it just wet the appetite more.
*  So I think at some level, people kind of know how many games you have and calibrate their
*  interest according to it.
*  And so I think if you did cut it by what you're talking about, I do think that you would be
*  more rewarded by more interest in the league.
*  I don't know if any owner wants to take that risk when they've got the money in hand, but
*  I do think that's how it would work out.
*  Well, one other thing about that lockout season, which is relevant to the time right now,
*  LeBron year two, Miami, Durant, OKC taken off, Kobe still circling around the Lakers,
*  Derrick Rose taking off in Chicago, Carmelo in New York, the old Celtics team.
*  There was just a lot of fun teams that year and a lot of fun storylines.
*  And then Dirk in Dallas trying to defend the title.
*  And I think where we're heading toward in the mid 2020s, especially now that we are
*  established in Minnesota as a real new contender, we're establishing OKC.
*  Luca and Kyrie might be able to play together.
*  You know, you got the Celtics, you have whatever the fuck's going on in Phoenix, and you'll
*  always have the Lakers.
*  And now there's a lot of players at the table.
*  Wait, before we go, we got to talk referees really fast.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  So this was the biggest rule change we've seen affect the competitiveness of the season
*  that I can remember in the NBA since 2004 or five when they headed into that 0-4 or
*  five season and got rid of the hand check and all that stuff.
*  You've been fascinated by it.
*  You've written about it a couple of times.
*  Most fascinating thing to you about this.
*  It's that we don't even know perhaps who's good or who is optimized for this.
*  I think Haralibab tweeted that he has to recalibrate everything with the San Quentin
*  rules, as he put it, where I'm looking at what happens to Denver right now.
*  And I'm looking at this team and I can tell something is weird about them.
*  Something is off.
*  Jamal Murray's throwing things at refs.
*  So maybe if we played the season out without the rule change, maybe they would come out
*  maybe they would come apart.
*  They wouldn't have a good title defense.
*  At the same time, I don't know.
*  Maybe they were just well situated for the old rules and the Timberwolves are well situated
*  for these new rules and this prison ballification or whatever you want to call it.
*  This whistle swallowing where I just looked it up.
*  The I think defensive efficiency.
*  There was no team.
*  I think the lowest team was at 104.6 for last postseason and there are four teams right
*  now in the postseason with a better defensive efficiency.
*  I don't even need to give people stats because everybody sees it.
*  Everybody sees Jamal Murray getting his leg humped all the way down the court.
*  Everybody can see that it's a different kind of situation right now.
*  And so that's part of what's interesting to me is just I don't know who is best
*  situated for this.
*  I've heard from people that, you know, Luca is kind of good with these rule changes.
*  He's just big.
*  You're not going to throw them off.
*  So maybe they're better than we thought they were.
*  And it's something that is completely changed.
*  Change the game.
*  And maybe this is another thing we could credit Adam Silver for.
*  This is bad process.
*  Good result.
*  I mean, generally, it's not good to have a secret rule change in the aftermath of your
*  TV meetings at All-Star during a rights negotiation, but I can't disagree with the result.
*  I love the result.
*  Yeah, me too.
*  I didn't like the cheapening of the sport.
*  I didn't like 145 to 135.
*  I think they're just like there's sort of an ideal length to the season.
*  There's an ideal score.
*  There's a platonic ideal.
*  And there's nothing more beautiful to me than 100 to 101 playoff game.
*  And yeah, they've got to refine it.
*  Maybe you can't have guys clawing each other's eyes out and they've got to figure out something
*  in the middle and a happy medium.
*  But I generally think this has been a great reform for the league and a direction I really
*  approve of, even if it was arrived at in a particularly shady way.
*  I remember Russell and I, because we were doing pods about it pretty early because we,
*  I mean, within the first nine, 10 days was like, this is different.
*  Okay, who's going to win from this?
*  I think Minnesota was one of the first two teams we talked about.
*  We were like, man, if these are going to be the rules, this is great for Minnesota.
*  I think we said the Knicks.
*  I think maybe we talked about the Lakers just because they know how to, you know,
*  with LeBron and Davis and the fact that LeBron gets still one guy who still gets calls.
*  But, but yeah, it turned out to be this fortuitous event for Minnesota.
*  But I have to ask you, what's your hottest take for why they did this?
*  My hot is the rational Ethan tape.
*  You know, you're known to whip some hot takes around from time to time.
*  What's, what's your hottest take for why they did this in February?
*  My hottest take would just be the conspiracy take.
*  It would be that one of the TV broadcasters said, look, you got to stop this craziness.
*  We'll give you the $2.6 billion or whatever, but you've got to stop this now and show,
*  you know, show that you're loyal to us and you'll be responsive to us.
*  We want to know that when we say jump, you know, you ask how high.
*  And that's, that's my take.
*  Do I know that that happened?
*  I know that Adam was humiliated by the all-star game.
*  And I know that there was some sort of event with Larry Bird and Bob Costas,
*  where they started cracking on the modern NBA and the lack of defense.
*  And they were getting belly laughs in the room.
*  And there was a bit of an embarrassment factor and everybody knows that the all-star game
*  isn't a real game, but it's sort of highlighted how the game had kind of become like an all-star game.
*  And so, yeah, the two hot takes are that it was demanded by a broadcaster or the other hot take
*  is that it was all Adam going back to his hotel room, steaming and going fine.
*  Fuck it.
*  Fuck you guys.
*  We're changing the rules.
*  Sick of Trey Young whipping his head back and getting a call.
*  Either one I like, either conspiracy theory I like,
*  and I don't think they're necessarily mutually exclusive.
*  I love the Adam goes back to his hotel room after the all-star game,
*  just pissed off sending emails to the director of officiating.
*  It's like, all right, execute operation prison ball.
*  And that's just that night the thing was sent.
*  He just had it, just being pissed because he was pissed when he was handing out the trophy.
*  I don't think it's a coincidence that everything shifted right after that.
*  But it's one of the, I would say one of the top two or three things he's done
*  since he's been commissioner.
*  The way he pulled off the Quippers Sterling thing is probably still number one for me
*  because that was a real crisis and he did it.
*  But this is up there, really realizing something is wrong with the league.
*  We can't wait till after this season to fix it.
*  And we're just fucking fixing it, letting the players figure out how to play with the new rules.
*  Rule changes are huge.
*  It's a huge aspect of what a commissioner can do.
*  What was one of the biggest things David Stern did?
*  It was what led to the seven seconds or less revolution where they had to go the other way,
*  where the platonic ideal, it was way too much the other way.
*  And instead of 145 to 135, it was 75 to 72.
*  And they had to figure it out.
*  A lot of the coaches-
*  There was a 66 to 61 in the playoff set year.
*  That was a final in Pacers Pistons, I think.
*  Was that the Reggie Miller getting a shot blocked by Prince game?
*  It was one of those.
*  It was in that era.
*  It was in that time.
*  So it's almost like when you're running the Fed where sometimes you've got to cut interest rates.
*  Sometimes you got to raise interest rates.
*  And as a commissioner, I think that's a valuable thing that you can do because these sports,
*  man, they're just the rules.
*  And we talk about it like there's just basketball with the 96 Bulls beat the Nuggets of today.
*  But the game is their rules.
*  The game is the rules of the game.
*  And if you change the rules, you change the game.
*  And the NBA changed the rules and the game has been changed.
*  And I think to a better end, I think these playoff games are just great theater.
*  Even as the Knicks, as they did back in the 1990s, try to make them as ugly as possible.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like even in the mid 2000s, it wasn't just the hand check rule.
*  And it wasn't just they switched his own defenses.
*  I thought two of the subtle things they did that were super smart were that 16 seconds to cross the
*  ball over half court instead of 14, which doesn't sound like anything, right?
*  It's two seconds, but there's just a pace sometimes.
*  And when I watch it, sometimes I feel like the guys aren't going to get over Brunson's,
*  the master of that.
*  You always feel like Brunson's going to get an eight second violation.
*  He barely gets it over in time.
*  And then resetting the shot clock on an offensive rebound, I think was huge
*  because these teams are good offensive rebounds.
*  And especially if you want to play with a slower pace, you just pull it back out
*  and you rip off another 18, 20 seconds.
*  And it sucked.
*  Now you get that rebound, you pull it out.
*  There's 11 seconds left already.
*  You got to like come up with another shot.
*  I think just those two things alone, plus the hand check, I thought, you know, it's one of
*  those things where you think, why didn't they always do this?
*  Which is how I feel now about reviewing block charge costs.
*  That would be my number one draft pick for get this the fuck out of basketball.
*  Just take it out.
*  We're going to be 50, 50, probably longterm with the 2000 block charge costs.
*  We review every season.
*  Just let's let's say coin flip.
*  Okay.
*  Get him the fuck out.
*  I don't want to watch another review of them.
*  Yeah, I would feel similarly.
*  I feel that way about replay review in general.
*  But this goes back to the TV incentives and the money.
*  Why sometimes what's good for fans isn't good for everybody.
*  There's a perverse incentive with the replay review at the end of these games
*  because people get so frustrated.
*  There was that crazy end to Warriors Lakers in the regular season that dragged on and on and on.
*  But the reverse, the perverse aspect of it is that the end of the game
*  is when the most people are watching.
*  So even if you're drawing it out and boring people,
*  you're going to get a bigger number often when that happens.
*  That's going to be a hard thing to argue against.
*  Oh, this is a good one.
*  So your conspiracy is this, this drags on the higher rating for longer.
*  Yes, it draws out the portion of the game when people are watching.
*  People are watching the most, which is unfortunate
*  because I think I'm not sure the juice is worth the squeeze.
*  I think it would be better to have European style games that are just boom, boom, boom.
*  At the end, I would want replay review gone in general.
*  I liked it when it was imperfect back in the day.
*  But given that perverse incentive, I'm not sure we're going to really get there.
*  That's another Adam hot take about the rule change, by the way, that
*  he was realizing we were going to get our asses kicked in the Olympics
*  and they had to fix this now because we're going to get to FIBA.
*  And these guys are just going to be like, wait, what?
*  I just got knocked on my driver.
*  You didn't call it.
*  So he was trying to trying to condition them to do it.
*  All right, before we go, give me your number one hottest media take right now.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Do I have a hot media?
*  You just pulled out of the microwave and you burnt your fingers on it.
*  Anything ESPN related?
*  Well, I said that I thought the ESPN got the best deal.
*  I don't know if that's really a hot take.
*  I'm trying to wonder.
*  Hot take.
*  That's not a day.
*  I think it's a good take.
*  They finagled it.
*  Now, I just don't know what a hot take is necessarily.
*  Other than that, maybe all the ratings are fake.
*  I'll say that much as a ratings watcher.
*  Let's do this.
*  As a ratings watcher, it is totally unpredictable in both directions.
*  There are some games where I used to be able to predict it.
*  I would talk about it with Ryan Glass speak of the New York Post and we would predict it.
*  We can't predict it anymore.
*  It's all over the map.
*  My theory is as they've changed the rating system where they've added out of home viewership,
*  where they used to not count you if you watched in an airport or a hospital,
*  they now have all these new counting systems which gave everybody
*  a double digit percentage boost for all of sports almost.
*  I feel like combined with that and how all the different streaming services are now incorporated,
*  it goes both ways where sometimes I go, wow, that's way fewer people than I would have thought.
*  Or wow, that's way more people than I would have thought.
*  I've called it the great vague.
*  This is just one of my many terms that is not going to catch on that I'll try out
*  in the podcast as I try to make fetch happen.
*  But I think that we are entering in general an era where we just don't know how popular anything is.
*  I'll miss, Bill, I will miss the days of just knowing because when we combine how Nielsen
*  is noodling around with new metrics and new scoring systems,
*  with how the streaming companies don't even want to tell us how many people watched,
*  I would love to know all the numbers on the Tom Brady roast.
*  I don't know if we'll ever know it.
*  We're just entering a period of time where we just won't know how popular things are.
*  You still say it happens with YouTube and podcasts too.
*  Because people can buy YouTube views and people can game the podcast system and the rankings
*  and the charts and there's all these different tricks for that.
*  But yeah, it's the age of disinformation and confusing information.
*  I have no idea.
*  Like when we get to the finals, the only thing I know for sure is they're going to release stuff
*  that countdown had the highest ratings since ever had that game four of the NBA finals had
*  the highest rating for a game four in 10 years.
*  Everything will be the highest and I just don't know if I believe any piece of it.
*  It doesn't make a lot of sense because it seems like there's so much competing media out there
*  and there are only so many young people who can sit still and watch a game in its entirety.
*  And more and more people are cord cutting.
*  So it would be hard for these things to get more popular.
*  But ultimately, I'm just not sure how much we'll really know going forward.
*  So welcome to the great veganing.
*  We'll get some statistics and we'll just have to kind of see for ourselves a bit and see how much
*  people pay for things.
*  The great veganing sounds like a new Apple TV drama with like, I don't know, it's like Jason Segal.
*  It's his comeback to Apple TV.
*  I don't know, Peter Gallagher's in it.
*  It's great.
*  Veganing.
*  They're setting the Midwest.
*  I think the whole Apatow crew winds up in that one.
*  And the great veganing?
*  I like it.
*  Yeah, it's a comeback.
*  Yeah, it's the writers workshop in the Midwest and all of these people want to get popular again now
*  that books aren't being published as much.
*  We'll figure it out.
*  We'll figure out what the great veganing actually is.
*  Other than not very catchy, but you know, I try.
*  All right.
*  You can read Ethan's Substack, which is very good.
*  Is.
*  I mean, you have to subscribe to it, but that's the world we live in in 2024.
*  Sometimes if it's good, you got to subscribe to it.
*  But I always respect how you went on your own and built an audience.
*  I thought it was pretty cool.
*  Well, thank you.
*  And I apologize for cockafying the audience by charging a sub fee.
*  Thanks, Bill.
*  Good to see you.
*  Thanks.
