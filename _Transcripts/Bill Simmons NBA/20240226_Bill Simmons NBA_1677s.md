# The Best NBA Players to See in Person | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [February 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=0.0s)]
*  Best guys to see in person. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=0.32s)]
*  This was inspired by using Yoke-age and Wimbenyama in back to back nights. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1.6s)]
*  And before we went to break, you talked about, you can go see Yoke-age in person [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=6.24s)]
*  and just watch Yoke-age the entire time. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=10.24s)]
*  And it's like going to a, you know, a concert where you're like, I'm just going to watch, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  you know, going to like Van Halen in the early eighties. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=18.72s)]
*  You're like, I'm just going to watch Eddie Van Halen and nobody else. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=21.04s)]
*  I'm just going to stare at him for three hours and just see what he does and try to learn some stuff. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=23.6s)]
*  Um, Yoke-age is the guy for that now. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=29.04s)]
*  And there's only been a couple, really a couple guys in the history of the league that I think [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=31.28s)]
*  hit that level where you're like, I don't, I'm not going to watch anybody else who's on the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=35.92s)]
*  court except for this guy. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  And you're still going to have like an incredible time. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=40.32s)]
*  So we're not doing a draft. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=42.8s)]
*  We're just going to do our list. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=44.0s)]
*  I made a list from, I did one to 10 actually. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  I told you to do one to five, but you can add a couple if you want, but. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=48.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=51.2s)]
*  Mid-season form. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=52.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=53.44s)]
*  I changed, I changed the segment without telling you. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=54.0s)]
*  Um, but I'm happy to stick with five. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=56.8s)]
*  So we're just going to alternate our number one, go down number two, all that. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=59.04s)]
*  But your number one is Yoke-age. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it's Yoke-age. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  Um, can you, can you let me do this here? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=67.36s)]
*  And I won't do this as long as everybody else. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=69.2s)]
*  I promise. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=72.39999999999999s)]
*  I know how much you love when I, when I go a little long, but I'm just going to tell you. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=73.12s)]
*  Is this a Rosilla log? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=76.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=78.4s)]
*  Just, and it's, I'm just going to sit here. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=78.96s)]
*  I got my, I got my Michael Jordan dream team cup. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  Is that near mint condition? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=85.2s)]
*  Oh, I have, I have the whole set. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=87.2s)]
*  I was going to break out some Christian Leightner today, but I think I'm going to [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=89.04s)]
*  wait until a later episode when we really need the energy. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=91.76s)]
*  But I got my Michael Jordan. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=94.16000000000001s)]
*  I got some water. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  You go, you do your thing. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  A little surprise. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=97.76s)]
*  Like it's almost like Christian Leightner's mom walked so Taylor Swift could run. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=98.48s)]
*  Cause if you are mad about Taylor Swift cutaways, if you were around for Leightner's [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  mom during the tournament, you would have just blown your brains out. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=107.76s)]
*  Like you wouldn't have been able to handle it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=111.04s)]
*  If the Taylor Swift isos get you this upset. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=112.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=115.2s)]
*  So Yocic against the wizards, who by the way, I think may have used all their timeouts [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=115.52s)]
*  in the first half. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=119.12s)]
*  I mean, it was, it was atrocious and it was kind of funny too. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=119.92s)]
*  Cause Yocic is like, these guys suck. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=122.56s)]
*  I'm just going to do stuff. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=124.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=126.08s)]
*  Well, but that's what Bird of Magic used to be like that too in the eighties. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=126.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=130.56s)]
*  These guys suck. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=130.72s)]
*  I'm going to just, I'm just try some shit. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=131.6s)]
*  It's exactly how it felt. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=134.32s)]
*  Like they were helpless. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=136.16s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=137.2s)]
*  So is this the game where he threw the 80, 80 foot alley-oop? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=137.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=141.2s)]
*  And I was at that basket that he threw it at. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=141.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=144.16s)]
*  And you could, he caught it one, he rebounded one hand, never touched the ball with his [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=144.4s)]
*  other hand and just threw it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=147.92s)]
*  And it was perfect. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=149.2s)]
*  I mean, it was absolutely perfect. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  80 feet in stride, Gordon gets a layup and it was like a touch pass. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=152.4s)]
*  So here are the early possessions and I promise you I'm not going to spend, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=158.0s)]
*  I'll make this as quick as I can. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=162.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=164.0s)]
*  So he comes down, it's a pin down screen to the left side to free somebody up to get the ball. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=164.24s)]
*  Then he goes block to block to come up, gets a post touch in the paint, double team, throws [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=169.28s)]
*  it out to Michael Porter Jr. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=173.6s)]
*  For a corner three. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=175.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=176.56s)]
*  Then he runs a two man game and Michael Porter Jr. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=177.12s)]
*  He screens, then re-screens kind of, but it's more of him just getting in the way. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=179.36s)]
*  And then he rolls off of that, gets it, and then hits the floater. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  Then he has a brush screen handoff. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=188.24s)]
*  Then he gets it back in the same possession, kicks it out to a three. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=190.48s)]
*  Then he decides like, you know what? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=195.84s)]
*  They're not, they're going to throw it back at me. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=199.28s)]
*  He repost because he has Kula Bali against him and he looks around almost like, are you [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=203.76s)]
*  seriously not going to double and let Kula Bali defend me now with a paint touch? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=208.0s)]
*  All right, fuck it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=211.6s)]
*  Hook shot, goes in. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=213.04s)]
*  He gets another post touch in the paint, KCP kicks it out, wide open three on a jump pass [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=214.8s)]
*  where he jumps in the air and you're, anybody else, you're like, oh my God, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=220.72s)]
*  that's going to be a turnover. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=223.84s)]
*  And he knew already where everybody was. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=225.2s)]
*  It was fine. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=227.12s)]
*  The next play he's pointing to the other saying, I don't want the ball. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=228.24s)]
*  So he sets a back screen and then another kind of pin down. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  And then Michael Porter Jr. gets it, but Jokic decides to like still move down, trailing the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=234.8s)]
*  place. The defender having to deal with Michael Porter Jr. can't totally commit to Michael [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  Porter Jr. because he's worried about Jokic's movement on the left side. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=244.4s)]
*  And then Michael Porter Jr. hits the floater. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=247.52s)]
*  Next possession, back screen from Murray, layup, never even touches the basketball. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  Then there's the one-handed pass that he throws to Aaron Gordon, like a quarterback. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=254.32000000000002s)]
*  Then on an inbounds play, he's not inbounding. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=259.12s)]
*  He's not the target for the inbound pass. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=261.52000000000004s)]
*  He sets up screen. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  The Wizards are so stupid, they don't even know what's going on, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=265.2s)]
*  but he already knows what's happening. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=267.68s)]
*  And he looks to be like, I'm just going to kind of get in the way here. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  Wide open three, Michael Porter Jr. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=273.52000000000004s)]
*  He hits it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=275.92s)]
*  That's the first six minutes of the game, Bill. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=276.56s)]
*  That's my point. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=279.2s)]
*  He leads the league in touches, 100 touches per game. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=280.4s)]
*  That's how many times he touches a basketball in a game. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=284.08s)]
*  But each touch is like a split second. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=287.36s)]
*  Okay. Great, great point. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  Because if you look at the top touch guys, Sabonis is second in the NBA, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=291.52s)]
*  Luka is third, Luka's third with 92 touches per game. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=297.84s)]
*  Jokic, the 100 touches, leads the league. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=301.84s)]
*  His average time he has the ball on those touches is 2.8 seconds. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=304.8s)]
*  Luka's at 5.6 seconds. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=310.16s)]
*  Ooh, I would get sired. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=312.16s)]
*  So here's Jokic. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=312.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=314.32s)]
*  Here's Jokic with 100 touches a game, but he's 20th in usage. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=314.8s)]
*  He screens, he re-screens, he doesn't even want to shoot. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  It feels like half the night. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=324.24s)]
*  I cannot, I can't get over how impressive it is that he's that talented. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=326.0s)]
*  His hands are perfect. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=331.6s)]
*  His feet are just amazing. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=332.96000000000004s)]
*  I know he's not the most athletic guy. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=335.36s)]
*  Even watching him scramble on defense, it actually looks worse than it actually is [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=337.44s)]
*  because he's like working to be in position and show and recover. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=341.12s)]
*  But the way he just moves, he already looks like he's out of breath and it's bad, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=344.4s)]
*  but he's actually in better position than he gets credit for. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=347.52s)]
*  For six minutes, all he wanted to do was get everybody involved. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=349.92s)]
*  And it's the best way to play basketball. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=353.68s)]
*  That's why we ride with Jokic. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=357.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I agree with everything you just said. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=360.64s)]
*  I would add this. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=362.88s)]
*  He solves stuff during the games while also kind of seeming like he's trying to fuck with the other [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=363.68s)]
*  team, especially if it's an inferior team, which I think makes them during garbage time, so much fun. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=368.88s)]
*  I don't see how this gets worse as the season goes along, whatever is happening with them. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=376.72s)]
*  Cause it feels like they'll go on a little run, they'll get ready. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=382.40000000000003s)]
*  And I'm just watching this, hoping they play the Lakers in round one and the Clippers in round [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=385.6s)]
*  two or round three, so we get to have them come into LA. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=389.68s)]
*  And go get to see him a bunch of times. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=391.92s)]
*  Cause I had an absolute blast going to the Nuggets Lakers games last year. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=393.52000000000004s)]
*  He's my favorite player to watch in the league and it's not even really close. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=397.68s)]
*  So we have the same number one. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=401.84000000000003s)]
*  I also want to mention when you see him in person, you realize how he kind of busts his ass on some [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=404.0s)]
*  of those fast breaks. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=408.24s)]
*  Like he's not like, I'm taking this playoff, I'm taking that playoff. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=410.16s)]
*  Like if there's a turnover or transition, he runs and he fills the lane, even though he's like [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=412.72s)]
*  kind of lumbered around with that weird Yoko stride, but he's like, I'm going to take this [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=417.44s)]
*  playoff and I'm going to go get that playoff and he'll take that playoff and he'll go get that [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=421.59999999999997s)]
*  playoff. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=424.64s)]
*  He is like that's the best way to go. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=424.88s)]
*  And he's not the guy that has to go on that drive, but he really does like put the time in [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=426.32s)]
*  trying to fill lanes, be in a trailer. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=431.52s)]
*  He also he wants to get the ball up the court. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=434.71999999999997s)]
*  So even when he clears it out of the rebound or somebody throws him the first outlet, he'll [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=436.96s)]
*  throw up another pass. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=440.79999999999995s)]
*  So like if he decided, Hey, I'm bringing the ball up every single time I'm stopping and [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=441.84s)]
*  I'm going to set up the offense. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=446.24s)]
*  really like the four seed here. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=447.52s)]
*  I mean, if you look at where they were at [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=449.02s)]
*  going into last night, they were, excuse me, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=450.18s)]
*  into tonight, 38 and 19. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=453.18s)]
*  Last year they were 39 and 18. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=454.82s)]
*  Their offensive numbers have dipped [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=457.09999999999997s)]
*  as far as where they rank, 12th this year, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=459.03999999999996s)]
*  fifth last year, but it's the same output. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=461.18s)]
*  It's just the entire league is up. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=463.18s)]
*  And the defense this year is actually the same number, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=464.94s)]
*  but it's ranked higher because again, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=468.18s)]
*  the offense has gone up. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=469.94s)]
*  But it makes everybody wanna play. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=471.46s)]
*  And you know you can't really stop [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=474.5s)]
*  paying attention at any point [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=476.28s)]
*  because he might throw you the ball. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=477.84s)]
*  And if you cut, you're gonna be rewarded. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=479.36s)]
*  And if you screen for him, he might screen for you [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=481.08s)]
*  and he'll set three screens. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=483.32s)]
*  I mean, he's fourth in screen assist in the NBA. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=484.56s)]
*  And when you look at that number in comparison [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=487.24s)]
*  to who else is in those top 10, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=488.92s)]
*  it's not guys winning an MVP. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=490.56s)]
*  So when I look at like him or a Steph [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=493.32s)]
*  and it kind of gets back to like my frustration [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=496.0s)]
*  with certain teams and what am I gonna let [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=497.96s)]
*  the regular season trick me into believing, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=499.96s)]
*  I go, is the solution, is the common thread here [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=502.52s)]
*  with all those Warriors teams or whatever that, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=506.02s)]
*  like hey, it's constant movement. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=508.46s)]
*  It's being tougher to guard. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=510.18s)]
*  It's continuing to cut and screen for guys [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=511.38s)]
*  because there's some special, special players in this league [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=514.5s)]
*  that can get buckets whenever they want. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=517.22s)]
*  But then I go, yeah, but that guy will never set a screen. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=519.18s)]
*  Like once he's out of the play, that's it. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=521.38s)]
*  My job is done. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=523.38s)]
*  Jokic never looks at the game that way. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=524.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's almost more like hockey. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=527.58s)]
*  He also does things during the game [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=529.82s)]
*  that I've never seen before. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=532.0s)]
*  Like he had a play today when he had Gordon on the left [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=533.06s)]
*  and it was a fast break. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=535.1199999999999s)]
*  And he faked off like he was gonna pass to Gordon [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=537.1199999999999s)]
*  and then did a two step like he was gonna do a floater. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=540.64s)]
*  And he started doing the floater [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=543.88s)]
*  and then at the last second he actually did throw to Gordon. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=545.1199999999999s)]
*  I was like, what just happened? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=547.52s)]
*  Was that a travel? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=548.9599999999999s)]
*  Was that legal? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=550.6199999999999s)]
*  How did he do that? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=551.4599999999999s)]
*  Do you know how many times I think [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=552.28s)]
*  it's gonna be an up and down and it never is? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=553.1199999999999s)]
*  It never is. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=555.16s)]
*  He always knows the footwork. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=556.0s)]
*  It's never going to be. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=556.8199999999999s)]
*  You're right, because he knows where the pass is going. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=557.76s)]
*  But the starting point, like watching him play defense live, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=560.1199999999999s)]
*  he came out and blitzed on the pick and roll, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=563.38s)]
*  stayed with the ball handler, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=565.34s)]
*  then retreated to the corner, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=566.54s)]
*  but then there was somebody else there. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=567.9s)]
*  So he had to like run across the paint [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=569.28s)]
*  to close off the guy in the opposite baseline. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=571.42s)]
*  And he threw his hands up in the air [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=573.9s)]
*  and just started like waving him around. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=575.94s)]
*  The only thing I could think of would be like, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=578.58s)]
*  you're going out to dinner with a buddy [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=579.9s)]
*  who'd been golfing all day and you'd go, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=581.1800000000001s)]
*  hey, are you drunk? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=584.0600000000001s)]
*  And he'd be like, no, I actually, I haven't had a drink. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=585.3000000000001s)]
*  And you'd be like, oh, okay, well, you're acting, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=590.16s)]
*  you're not drunk? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=592.8s)]
*  And you're like, no, I just got to dinner. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=593.64s)]
*  I didn't drink a golf today. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=595.36s)]
*  Like, what are you talking about? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=596.56s)]
*  Like the way, if you were to just watch, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=597.96s)]
*  if you would never watch Jokic before, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=600.6s)]
*  not granted in the offensive stuff, you figure it out. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=602.16s)]
*  But I also realized like why this guy went [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=604.36s)]
*  in the second round. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=606.24s)]
*  Because there's times where he moves around, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=607.3199999999999s)]
*  be like, what is he doing? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=608.92s)]
*  Like what's going on there? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=610.64s)]
*  And you're like, actually he's in position. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=611.76s)]
*  Yeah, there's a method to the madness. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=614.76s)]
*  He visually doesn't look as special [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=616.28s)]
*  as all these other superior athletes that we have in the league. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=619.5s)]
*  Well, if he wins the MVP in the title this year, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=624.02s)]
*  and I assume he'll be first team all-MBA, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=627.9s)]
*  which give him four. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=630.14s)]
*  So last six years, he'd have four first, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=632.0s)]
*  two second all-team all-MBAs, two MVPs, two finals, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=635.22s)]
*  two titles, which is putting him on pace [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=639.5799999999999s)]
*  to go into that final group. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=642.62s)]
*  The Pantheon. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=646.38s)]
*  What's your top pyramid again? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=647.66s)]
*  He's level five is the last level, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=649.14s)]
*  and he's starting to sniff it a little bit. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=652.78s)]
*  It's like, wait, what's going on up there? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=654.78s)]
*  There's another door? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=656.38s)]
*  How many people are on level five right now? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=657.82s)]
*  15, 16, 15 or 16, I can't remember. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=659.82s)]
*  Who was like 15 and 16? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=664.78s)]
*  Durant, I've had him, he was in level five, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=667.66s)]
*  and then we sent him back to level four, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=671.6800000000001s)]
*  and I don't know where he's gonna end up. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=673.5s)]
*  He's right there. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=676.7s)]
*  He's in a door, he gets to basically, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=678.06s)]
*  he has a cot in level five, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=680.14s)]
*  but he has his apartments in level four. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=681.62s)]
*  But he gets to go up and see everybody in level five [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=684.02s)]
*  every once in a while. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=686.02s)]
*  Which is rare, I imagine. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=687.98s)]
*  I had, I told you I didn't wanna shoot my wad [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=690.54s)]
*  with 17 segment ideas, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=694.94s)]
*  because we're gonna be together every Sunday, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=696.46s)]
*  but there's a best players of the last 10 years argument [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=697.98s)]
*  that yolkage is getting closer. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=702.5s)]
*  We'll do it another time. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=704.3s)]
*  All right, I'll go second [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=706.06s)]
*  with my second favorite guy to see in person. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=708.82s)]
*  It's still Curry. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=712.7s)]
*  I still like, if he's in town, I wanna go, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=716.12s)]
*  and if I don't go, I'm like, oh man, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=718.98s)]
*  I probably should have gone to see Curry. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=721.02s)]
*  I don't know how many more years he has left at this level. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=722.46s)]
*  It's like one of those. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=725.74s)]
*  It's like, oh, pick a favorite band. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=727.22s)]
*  Oh, they're in town again, I saw them last year. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=728.98s)]
*  I don't know, but then you don't go, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=731.0999999999999s)]
*  and you're like, oh man, I probably should have gone. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=733.0999999999999s)]
*  What if they break up? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=734.6199999999999s)]
*  I don't know how many more Curry years are left, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=736.02s)]
*  but he's another one where you can just watch him [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=737.8199999999999s)]
*  the entire game, watch how he moves, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=741.3399999999999s)]
*  watch how his teammates try to do those little handoff [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=743.6199999999999s)]
*  thingies with them, and just how he uses his body, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=746.9799999999999s)]
*  how he uses his body in traffic. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=750.2399999999999s)]
*  I never get old, so never gets old for me. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=751.78s)]
*  So I have him second. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=754.1199999999999s)]
*  Who'd you have second? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=755.3399999999999s)]
*  Steph. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=756.7399999999999s)]
*  Okay, we don't need to talk about Steph. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=758.0999999999999s)]
*  I feel like we spent 10,000 hours. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=760.5799999999999s)]
*  So here's where it gets interesting. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=763.26s)]
*  You just saw this guy in person. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=766.9s)]
*  Is Wemby your number three? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=768.26s)]
*  Not yet, no. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=770.3s)]
*  Okay, who's your number three? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=771.3399999999999s)]
*  It's Ant. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=773.3399999999999s)]
*  Oh, okay, make the case. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=775.4599999999999s)]
*  Look, I know he sucked the other night against Milwaukee. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=781.06s)]
*  But the Miss Dunkey had in the lane [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=785.6999999999999s)]
*  was probably one of my favorite highlights of the week. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=787.66s)]
*  I just, I hate to say it reminds me of somebody, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=791.26s)]
*  but he does move like him a little. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=796.42s)]
*  Let's just not even say his name. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=798.3s)]
*  And it's not even fair to Ant or the other guy [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=800.2199999999999s)]
*  that we're talking about. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=803.5799999999999s)]
*  There's just some stuff when he, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=805.26s)]
*  and his passing on these deep drives [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=806.9799999999999s)]
*  is getting better and better. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=809.38s)]
*  Like it's not out of nowhere. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=811.02s)]
*  You could see some glimpses. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=812.0999999999999s)]
*  And I do think sometimes these drive passes, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=813.06s)]
*  we give them almost too much credit for it [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=814.78s)]
*  because it's like, hey, the guys are all stationed [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=816.0999999999999s)]
*  where they're supposed to be stationed. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=817.6999999999999s)]
*  But there's times where he's getting a pass out [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=819.1800000000001s)]
*  to a corner or to the break, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=820.94s)]
*  where I'm like, how did he even get that out there? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=822.34s)]
*  So I think just the physical moments with him, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=824.66s)]
*  just the like top 1% athleticism with him, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=830.02s)]
*  and to tie it into that it's been one of the best teams [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=834.94s)]
*  in the league this year, that I would have Ant three. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=837.3000000000001s)]
*  I know you don't wanna mention him. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=841.62s)]
*  We're not trying to put this on him. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=843.58s)]
*  Kobe reminded everybody the most of Jordan. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=846.22s)]
*  And in some ways was doing [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=850.94s)]
*  like a really great Jordan impersonation, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=852.6600000000001s)]
*  even like mimicking how he shot. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=855.3000000000001s)]
*  It was like. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=857.02s)]
*  Well, how about the way he talked, like the cadence. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=857.86s)]
*  That was almost like weird, but. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=860.62s)]
*  Well, it was like when we did Creed in Philly [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=862.34s)]
*  and for rewatchables with the live thing. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=865.5400000000001s)]
*  Creed has that scene when Donny is watching [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=867.34s)]
*  the second Balboa Creed fight [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=871.3000000000001s)]
*  and he gets up in front of the TV [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=873.0600000000001s)]
*  and he starts mimicking all the Creed's punches [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=874.5799999999999s)]
*  and movements in it. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=877.3399999999999s)]
*  And then you see the TV behind him and he's doing exactly. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=878.42s)]
*  That's like the level Kobe was at with Jordan. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=881.3399999999999s)]
*  Like he tried to mirror so many things that Jordan did. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=883.38s)]
*  So he would be number one. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=887.5s)]
*  I weighed always, I thought had some MJ in him [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=888.86s)]
*  before his knees started to go, like the second Miami year. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=891.78s)]
*  But if you watch, especially him in 2009 [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=894.66s)]
*  when he had nobody, but he was, I thought the closest [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=898.5s)]
*  from all the stuff he did to Jordan. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=903.46s)]
*  Cause you know, he didn't really shoot threes. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=905.62s)]
*  He just tried to get to the rim. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=907.54s)]
*  He had that pull-up game. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=908.78s)]
*  And then Edwards, there is moments where [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=910.94s)]
*  you get a little Deja MJ. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=914.14s)]
*  Like, oh, that looks, plus he carries himself [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=916.98s)]
*  like the fucking alpha. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=919.02s)]
*  Like I'm the best looking person in this building. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=920.22s)]
*  I'm the best athlete in this building. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=923.14s)]
*  I am completely unafraid of the other team. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=925.62s)]
*  Don't trash talk me. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=928.54s)]
*  I'll get upset. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=929.58s)]
*  Like there's just some elements. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=930.74s)]
*  Yeah, and then, you know, after they had beaten [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=933.42s)]
*  the Clippers and you know, you can take all these top teams [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=935.42s)]
*  like, hey, what about that outcome? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=937.94s)]
*  What about that outcome? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=939.1s)]
*  I thought that win for them was huge. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=940.42s)]
*  And you know, the way the Clippers had just been [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=943.1s)]
*  beating on everybody for two straight months. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=945.3s)]
*  But then the weird part about like calling out [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=947.62s)]
*  the Clippers and them being old. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=950.38s)]
*  And then when Kawhi was asked about it, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=951.98s)]
*  Kawhi almost like downplayed it. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=953.82s)]
*  And I don't know if that's just Kawhi [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=956.46s)]
*  who doesn't want to talk to anybody [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=958.06s)]
*  or if there was any element of it being like, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=959.26s)]
*  I'll let Ant mess with us. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=961.46s)]
*  Like I'll let that guy mess with us because he's him. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=963.5s)]
*  And I don't mean that the mean way. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=966.54s)]
*  And then the other funny thing from All-Star weekend [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=968.14s)]
*  was everyone can't, like they cannot wait [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=971.18s)]
*  to show off their fits and he's in a hoodie. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=974.06s)]
*  Like I don't even care. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=976.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=977.7s)]
*  I actually was hoping he'd be the guy who's like, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=978.54s)]
*  I'm gonna be the one guy that cares about the All-Star game [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=980.66s)]
*  but he actually went the other way. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=982.78s)]
*  He's like, I care the least. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=985.06s)]
*  Actually you think Luca, Yoko, Chika, Luis, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=986.74s)]
*  actually me, I care the least. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=990.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=992.1s)]
*  My number three is Wemby. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=993.26s)]
*  Just because it's new. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=998.02s)]
*  There's a new car smell to it. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=999.14s)]
*  But the stuff that- [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1000.6999999999999s)]
*  Did you go on Friday? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1001.54s)]
*  I didn't go on Friday and I regret it [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1002.38s)]
*  because I had some parents stuff. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1004.26s)]
*  But I am excited to see him do his thing. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1006.86s)]
*  And especially it feels like he's starting [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1013.54s)]
*  to put together the off the ball stuff. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1015.98s)]
*  The I'm not really involved in this play. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1019.14s)]
*  Oh wait, I am. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1020.82s)]
*  Oh, you can see the other team is starting [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1022.46s)]
*  to really think about him profoundly [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1024.9s)]
*  when they're within like 25 feet of the basket. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1027.42s)]
*  He's starting all the stuff that was frustrating [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1029.98s)]
*  about him in summer league in the beginning of the year [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1032.02s)]
*  where it's like, dude, you're seven foot five. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1034.02s)]
*  Just kind of traffic cop the rim a little bit more. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1035.74s)]
*  Like you're not a small forward. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1039.02s)]
*  Like stop with that. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1040.3s)]
*  You're seven foot five. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1041.14s)]
*  It feels like he's figured out that part. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1042.74s)]
*  And then there's so much in his game [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1044.54s)]
*  that's just terrible right now. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1046.66s)]
*  Like his pull up jumpers are awful. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1047.94s)]
*  And I think he might have the lowest pull up jumper [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1050.58s)]
*  field goal percentage league. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1052.74s)]
*  But then there's some fluid, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1054.06s)]
*  like spin moves and stuff and traffic. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1056.98s)]
*  And he's dunking and you don't even realize [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1059.38s)]
*  he had a chance to dunk and he's not even jumping. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1060.94s)]
*  I just haven't seen enough of he yet. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1063.78s)]
*  I wish I liked watching his team more. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1065.38s)]
*  But I want to see him in person [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1067.62s)]
*  a couple more times this season. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1069.14s)]
*  Yeah, in person it's a different experience. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1071.9s)]
*  Yeah, so what'd you see? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1075.1399999999999s)]
*  Tell us. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1075.98s)]
*  Well, you could see just there were different times [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1078.6599999999999s)]
*  when guys in the Lakers, like Austin Reeves [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1081.5s)]
*  get caught on a screen once with him. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1083.1s)]
*  And it was just like, what? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1084.6599999999999s)]
*  Like this is, are you kidding me? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1086.26s)]
*  I'm supposed to get through this? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1088.6599999999999s)]
*  Can you give me a broom? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1089.94s)]
*  And then Reeves thought he had him [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1091.1399999999999s)]
*  on the left side for a layup. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1092.8999999999999s)]
*  And I love that he tried, but it was, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1094.54s)]
*  it was like Wemby almost as he was going up, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1097.62s)]
*  he's like, are you seriously going to try to do this? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1100.02s)]
*  Okay, whatever. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1101.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1102.46s)]
*  He stripped LeBron in transition, which I couldn't believe. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1103.3s)]
*  You're like, what? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1108.74s)]
*  There's just, the rest of, it's almost more fun [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1111.3s)]
*  watching the moments of everybody else [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1114.8999999999999s)]
*  that's on the court and the opponent. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1116.78s)]
*  Right, reacting to the experience of playing against Wemby. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1118.82s)]
*  Are you serious? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1122.1s)]
*  And then, you know, in the second half, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1122.94s)]
*  guys just aborting, like they'll beat their man [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1124.86s)]
*  off the dribble and they go, whatever. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1127.1399999999999s)]
*  Like, I'm just going to curl, I'm going to curl back around. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1129.5s)]
*  And then when you add up all the blocks and the steals [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1133.8999999999999s)]
*  and all those numbers, and he went, by the way, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1135.6599999999999s)]
*  he went crazy in the first few minutes. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1137.4199999999998s)]
*  And it was funny, kind of just sitting in the stands, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1139.06s)]
*  because for so many people, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1141.4199999999998s)]
*  it's the first time they've ever seen him. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1142.74s)]
*  And then like other people that aren't super into the NBA, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1144.34s)]
*  they think they're watching an alien. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1146.74s)]
*  And you hear like somebody asking the boyfriend being like, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1148.58s)]
*  who, how old is this guy? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1151.1399999999999s)]
*  What's his deal? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1152.62s)]
*  Like, oh, he's this French kid. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1153.74s)]
*  And then they're like, how old is he? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1154.8999999999999s)]
*  And somebody else would be like, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1156.1399999999999s)]
*  oh, I think he's like 25. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1156.98s)]
*  And they're like, oh, wow, he's pretty, he's going to be good. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1157.82s)]
*  And somebody else is like, no, he's 20. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1160.34s)]
*  And then he's like, he's going to be the best part [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1163.78s)]
*  of his generation. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1165.18s)]
*  So he lit it up. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1166.02s)]
*  I mean, I think he had 11 points in like his first, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1166.8600000000001s)]
*  his first rotation there of like six minutes or something, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1169.3s)]
*  because he was hitting threes on top of everything else. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1171.8600000000001s)]
*  But there's usually like every few possessions, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1173.7s)]
*  there's a moment where he's the only guy in the world [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1176.5800000000002s)]
*  that can do the stuff that he's doing. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1178.8600000000001s)]
*  So him being fourth, I don't have a problem with. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1179.7s)]
*  I just, I think, because the new part of it [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1182.98s)]
*  and wondering what it will be like that night, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1185.6200000000001s)]
*  I can't imagine being dispersed season ticket. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1187.6200000000001s)]
*  The number of things that you've seen [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1189.74s)]
*  with him is just stuff you've never seen before. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1191.46s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1193.5s)]
*  So you have him fourth. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1194.58s)]
*  You know what, I'll put him down fourth. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1198.14s)]
*  I mean, I'm not trying to mirror you here, but. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1199.66s)]
*  I had him third. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1201.98s)]
*  Look, I landed in LA and had been gone for eight days [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1204.26s)]
*  and in a million, a million, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1209.26s)]
*  I'm not going to a basketball game that night. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1211.3s)]
*  And instead it was Wembee and I was like, I'm in. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1213.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1216.9s)]
*  You know one thing that I've been impressed by [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1217.94s)]
*  is that he's not as clumsily as he was in the last season. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1219.78s)]
*  I mean, I've been watching him a little more [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1222.78s)]
*  where I was really having trouble watching them, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1225.22s)]
*  but lately they've been more fun to watch. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1227.02s)]
*  He's less, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1229.46s)]
*  clumsy is not the wrong word, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1232.46s)]
*  but you know how poor Zingas has three times a game [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1233.78s)]
*  where you're convinced his season's about to be over? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1236.06s)]
*  Like he jumps, he lands in traffic [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1238.58s)]
*  or he hits knees with somebody [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1241.18s)]
*  or he has like a stumble and you're like, oh no. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1242.82s)]
*  Wembee doesn't have as many of those [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1247.06s)]
*  but he's really coordinated. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1248.86s)]
*  I don't know how to explain it. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1251.4199999999998s)]
*  He's just, he seems like, it's almost like a ballet dancer. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1252.6599999999999s)]
*  He knows kind of where to land and where to go. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1255.58s)]
*  And he avoids, avoids trouble more than I thought [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1259.1s)]
*  with that stuff. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1262.9799999999998s)]
*  Cause usually the tall guys, they're just a constant, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1263.82s)]
*  you know, some sort of dumb, stupid knocking knees [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1266.82s)]
*  into somebody's hip or stepping on a foot or whatever. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1270.74s)]
*  He doesn't really have them. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1274.04s)]
*  My number four is still Yanis. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1276.02s)]
*  I still have Yanis in my top four [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1280.06s)]
*  for going to see him in person, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1282.98s)]
*  just cause I love how hard he plays. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1284.46s)]
*  And he is one of those that in person [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1286.18s)]
*  feels different than on TV. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1290.3s)]
*  In person you get the size, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1292.7s)]
*  you get the crazy, like his crazy length with his arms. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1294.3799999999999s)]
*  And he does have those moments where you're like, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1297.74s)]
*  fucking A, how does anybody stay in front of this guy? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1301.5s)]
*  So I still enjoy seeing him and I would have him fourth. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1304.68s)]
*  Yeah, basically everything we just said about Wemby, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1308.3600000000001s)]
*  like it's not like Yanis, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1310.5600000000002s)]
*  it's pretty close to the same experience. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1313.6000000000001s)]
*  Sitting there for the end season tournament games [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1316.04s)]
*  and seeing it live and having those seats, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1317.8s)]
*  there's just, it's the same thing. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1320.24s)]
*  We were like, I can't, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1321.88s)]
*  I can't believe the guy picks up his dribble from there [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1323.3200000000002s)]
*  and is at the rim. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1325.88s)]
*  And there's just moments where you're helpless. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1327.1200000000001s)]
*  Like the opponent, you're absolutely helpless against them [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1329.2s)]
*  because he's gonna find a way. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1331.24s)]
*  And when he's really trying, you're always like, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1332.0800000000002s)]
*  man, how are they gonna beat this guy [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1333.6s)]
*  when he's trying like this? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1335.44s)]
*  It's always like surprising. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1336.48s)]
*  All right, who do you have for number five? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1337.76s)]
*  Probably Ben Simmons, cause it's such a treat. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1344.0s)]
*  Just to watch somebody dribble the ball up the court. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1347.84s)]
*  No, cause he's playing, so you're like, hey he's back. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1350.1599999999999s)]
*  Run under the basket. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1352.24s)]
*  I've set my notifications to next off season [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1353.9199999999998s)]
*  for the Ben Simmons is back summer. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1356.52s)]
*  I'll probably go with, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1360.3s)]
*  you know what, I'm just gonna go with it. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1365.8600000000001s)]
*  I wrote it down. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1368.22s)]
*  I think Zion in person, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1370.38s)]
*  even though the time we saw him in person, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1371.7s)]
*  it was terrible. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1373.14s)]
*  You can't quit Zion. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1373.98s)]
*  I can't, I can't. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1374.82s)]
*  He had a great block down the stretch today. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1376.78s)]
*  Yeah, they lost though. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1379.06s)]
*  They lost. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1380.26s)]
*  I can't figure that team out. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1381.1000000000001s)]
*  They have the guys back and then they lose. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1381.92s)]
*  Well, they didn't have a point guard tonight. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1384.8600000000001s)]
*  They didn't have McCollum and then Alvarado got suspended. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1387.22s)]
*  So it was like Herb Jones and Ingram and Zion [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1389.8600000000001s)]
*  bringing the ball up. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1392.74s)]
*  Yeah, but they get smoked by Miami. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1394.26s)]
*  At one point in the late in the second quarter, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1395.94s)]
*  they were 8% from three and Miami was 64%. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1397.7s)]
*  Like every time I want to get excited about them, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1400.66s)]
*  but I'll just tell you as far as watching it, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1402.66s)]
*  point Zion is still one of my favorite things [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1405.18s)]
*  to watch in the league. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1408.0600000000002s)]
*  So there you go. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1409.38s)]
*  I have SGA number five. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1411.14s)]
*  I really had an absolute ball watching him in person [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1413.6200000000001s)]
*  earlier this season against the Clippers [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1418.02s)]
*  and I want to see him again. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1420.1s)]
*  I hope, you know, it's fun cause both L.A. teams [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1420.9399999999998s)]
*  are on play for playoff series [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1424.74s)]
*  and I really hope OKC is gonna be one of them, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1426.34s)]
*  but his herky jerky stuff that he does, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1429.1s)]
*  I'm not tired of it yet. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1432.34s)]
*  So I had him, I had Durant six and I had Edward seven. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1433.78s)]
*  So I gave SGA the nod. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1437.3799999999999s)]
*  You'd rather watch SGA than Ant? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1438.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1444.3799999999999s)]
*  Listen, top seven is solid. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1446.02s)]
*  It's not like I kicked him in the first. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1448.62s)]
*  He's the better player, which no sane person would debate, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1450.46s)]
*  but I don't know about that. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1453.78s)]
*  I like watching how cool and calm and efficient he is, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1456.26s)]
*  how he runs that team that's just this young team [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1460.22s)]
*  that should have no business being on pace [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1463.7s)]
*  to have like 58 wins. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1465.58s)]
*  And then in crunch time he takes over everything. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1467.54s)]
*  But I also, I have a little bit of a personal connection [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1469.78s)]
*  cause I watched him as a rookie. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1472.42s)]
*  So when I see him now, I'm just like, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1474.46s)]
*  I love basketball and I talk about it [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1477.06s)]
*  and used to write about it for a living [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1480.02s)]
*  and I did not see any sign that this was gonna happen. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1482.02s)]
*  So when I'm watching, I'm like, how did I not know this? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1485.14s)]
*  So I'm going back almost to that 2018 season. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1488.14s)]
*  Like, man, I just thought this guy was gonna be [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1492.22s)]
*  like a really good defender and knock down some open threes. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1494.02s)]
*  How did I miss this? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1497.94s)]
*  But I think everybody feels that way. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1499.78s)]
*  Although Doc's now taking credit for seeing it the whole time, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1501.46s)]
*  which he did on my podcast. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1504.78s)]
*  And I do think Doc tried to talk them out [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1508.0600000000002s)]
*  of throwing him in that trade. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1510.1000000000001s)]
*  I do think that's legitimate. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1511.54s)]
*  Twitter doesn't like Doc. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1513.3000000000002s)]
*  So I think even if Doc had a point to make, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1514.8200000000002s)]
*  it just was gonna turn into the same thing [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1518.38s)]
*  like when LeBron says, you know, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1520.38s)]
*  but LeBron has some bad ones on his resume [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1522.7s)]
*  as far as pointing out. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1526.14s)]
*  I don't think Doc is that world. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1526.98s)]
*  He's the league leader in the club. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1527.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, Doc's out there though. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1529.26s)]
*  We didn't pick Luca. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1530.7s)]
*  Are we so, okay, are we so conditioned [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1533.78s)]
*  to how absurd he is that we're taking it for granted [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1537.02s)]
*  and we're not, you didn't even put him in your top seven. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1540.5s)]
*  I had him eight. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1544.3400000000001s)]
*  It's the mono ball that I just, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1546.74s)]
*  you and I are aligned on that. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1549.74s)]
*  The heliocentric, I don't like watching. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1552.18s)]
*  I actually, I thought about putting Kyrie over him [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1554.5800000000002s)]
*  from the standpoint of when you see Kyrie in person [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1559.38s)]
*  and he actually cares, it's always amazing. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1561.9s)]
*  Like you just see things like, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1564.22s)]
*  oh, that nobody else in the league can do that. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1565.42s)]
*  Oh, he just went into the lane [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1567.8200000000002s)]
*  and just did a running lefty layup [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1569.8600000000001s)]
*  that he lofted off the shot clock and it went in. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1572.3400000000001s)]
*  But I don't like the, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1576.0600000000002s)]
*  I don't like when one guy has the ball at that time. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1577.1000000000001s)]
*  I felt that way with Harden. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1579.46s)]
*  I felt that way with Westbrook. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1580.8600000000001s)]
*  I feel that way with Luca. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1582.14s)]
*  I know it's working. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1583.46s)]
*  I know he's unbelievable, but it's just not for me. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1584.3000000000002s)]
*  It's not my kind of basketball. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1587.22s)]
*  Where is Luca on your MVP ballot? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1588.74s)]
*  Let me look, because I actually did it. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1593.82s)]
*  I had a little MVP list. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1596.22s)]
*  And I'm top five. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1602.34s)]
*  So is that SGA too behind Jokic? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1606.02s)]
*  I have Jokic, SGA, Luca, Janis, and Tatum, a distant fifth. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1609.78s)]
*  And people are trying to get some Tatum MVP stuff going. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1615.26s)]
*  It's like, come on, I love the Celtics. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1617.86s)]
*  I would never in a million years make the case for him. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1620.26s)]
*  Yeah, the Tatum push has been weird. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1623.82s)]
*  It's a ridiculous argument. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1624.66s)]
*  It's the last couple, I don't know. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1625.5s)]
*  Is it a week or something? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1627.34s)]
*  And look, he said he was the best. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1628.5s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1629.74s)]
*  That's what you're supposed to do. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1630.58s)]
*  I think the weird part for Tatum is that, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1632.1399999999999s)]
*  I went on a cowherd show [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1634.5s)]
*  and he was kind of knocking a little bit. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1635.62s)]
*  I was like, look, if you want him to be one [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1636.74s)]
*  of the top four guys, I'll tell you that you're right. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1637.98s)]
*  But where is that? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1641.06s)]
*  But where he's at is pretty good. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1643.18s)]
*  And if the Celtics find a way to pull it out this summer, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1646.02s)]
*  then the shows that next morning will say, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1648.7s)]
*  hey, is he actually the best player in the world? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1651.38s)]
*  There's no way a full season from Jokic, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1653.18s)]
*  I could ever fathom voting for Tatum over Jokic. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1655.8200000000002s)]
*  I don't even think I'd vote for Tatum over Doncic. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1658.5s)]
*  If you're doing that as a segment on your show, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1661.7s)]
*  then that means it was a boring week. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJLRoDzvXs&t=1664.14s)]
