# Fun Zion Williamson Trade Scenarios | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXOlirqKOOQ)
*  Would you do Jaylen Brown for Zion and Herb Jones?
*  I get Herb Jones too?
*  Well, Zion for Jaylen Brown's a no, right?
*  Straight up, if you're Boston.
*  Oh, look at you.
*  Look at him.
*  You and I've, I think you and I are in the higher end of Zion believers.
*  I just, there was two different points of his career where he was doing stuff I'd never seen before from somebody with his body and his size and his profile.
*  And both of us were like, I think you and I were about as focused on it as any non Pelicans fans for like, do you guys realize what's happening right now?
*  It was like, this guy is completely unguardable.
*  I just worry that he got the contract already and he doesn't seem to have any sort of maturity at all.
*  Like at all.
*  And if he was playing for something, I would feel better about it.
*  But the fact that he already has the money makes me really nervous because we've seen this a few times.
*  I would probably say no, but man, I would, I would have a three hour meeting with my staff only because I was, I've made five conference finals in seven years.
*  And I don't know, would you do it?
*  No, I probably would.
*  And by the way, just for everybody that's going to like, cause I can already see the, oh, they proposed a trade that didn't even go through.
*  Like if you'll allow us the flexibility of knowing that other contract filler will be thrown into some of these things, even if like the parameters of the deal, like look, if Boston, New Orleans wanted to figure out a Zion, Jalen Brown deal, they probably could figure one out.
*  Yeah.
*  After July 1st, it gets a lot easier to.
*  Well, not on the bigger number stuff.
*  Like the new CBA, it actually is tougher to match up the salaries in the new one.
*  But they could do, it could be Zion and Herb Jones for Jalen Brown and Gallinari and you could get basically exactly the same numbers.
*  You probably have to, you probably have to add more on the, on the New Orleans side.
*  So maybe, you know, anyway, look, so if you allow us the creativity of giving you the, the main points without having to, whatever.
*  So, okay, but here's the thing, like Jalen Brown going to the Pelicans solves their Zion problem immediately.
*  And if you're Boston, whatever you think of them now, and even kind of on the Phoenix thing, one of my number one things that I'll do is I'll look at what you're doing and go, okay, does this at least give you a chance?
*  Does this give you a chance to compete for a championship?
*  And that's not a long list of the teams and as disappointing as Boston's losses to Miami, they go into next year, still having a legitimate chance to win an NBA championship and messing with that and breaking that up.
*  Despite the flaws, like every other team, I wouldn't be in a hurry to mess with that.
*  So if I'm Boston, I'd still say no, despite it.
*  You would have like some real moments being like, what, what, imagine if we get Zion and he figures it out.
*  But again, that's a huge, that's a huge, like he's played 114 games in four years, played 29 games.
*  And he's had a couple of major injuries and just does not seem like he can stay in shape.
*  Yeah, I did. I did a thing on my pod like six weeks ago about the almost club.
*  Like what, how long is a window for a team before you just kind of have to go, we got to try something different.
*  Like we can't get over the hump.
*  And it does feel like the Celtics are either there this season or they're one season away.
*  Like if it doesn't happen for them next season, at some point you just got to go, look, man, this has been 80% of a decade.
*  We got to like do something. We can't just be like, let's run it back.
*  I'm mailing you this trade because it's complicated.
*  Just so you look at it. I just texted it to you.
*  It's a Zion trade.
*  It involves New Orleans and Charlotte and Houston.
*  Okay. And here's the trade.
*  Thank you for sending these to me because now I can look at it as you're saying it. Appreciate it.
*  Houston gets Zion Williamson and the number 27 pick.
*  Charlotte gets the number four pick, Jalen Green and Kira Lewis.
*  So they move back two spots and they get Jalen Green.
*  New Orleans gets the number two pick and Terry Roger and first round picks from Brooklyn in 24 and 26.
*  So basically they flip Zion into number two, Terry Roger and two Brooklyn firsts.
*  Charlotte moves back two spots, picks up Jalen Green.
*  Houston rolls the dice with Zion.
*  They sign James Harden and they go to war next year with James Harden and then Zion,
*  which I think would be unbelievable for the restaurants in the Houston area.
*  All the service industries.
*  All the service industries, huge win. The waiters, other people.
*  Zion and Harden together would be kind of unbelievable.
*  I don't know what version of Harden we're getting, but I also wonder if they're getting Harden at all,
*  which makes me wonder, do you just say fuck it and take a swing?
*  I don't know if this is true or not, but they said there's an in-game,
*  you know how like during the breaks in a game they play the videos and they ask NBA players trivia questions
*  or like who's the best on the team at this and who's the worst.
*  I think there's one of Zion, I've been told this, but I haven't seen it, so I don't know.
*  But the in-game thing, it's like what's your favorite, what are your favorite road trips?
*  And he says Houston and Atlanta.
*  Okay. So he'd be happy.
*  Right. So he'd be happy.
*  The part of the Zion thing is that he's actually, despite how frustrating it's been,
*  he's their star in a market that has a really hard time keeping them or enticing anyone to go there.
*  So you take Scoot, who is by all accounts a fucking grown up right away, who's going to work his ass off,
*  who is going to will himself to be an awesome NBA player and you basically change your culture overnight
*  with a guy who's like, I'm going to fucking kill myself to be your superstar versus the guy they have now.
*  So again, so Charlotte, can we just go one at a time?
*  If you're Charlotte, would you move back two spots and you get Jalen Green out of it?
*  Probably.
*  Well, no, I take Scoot. I take Scoot because the whole thing is, you know what?
*  To say in a vacuum, I'm only moving two spots back and to do that, I add Jalen Green.
*  But moving two spots back now moves despite the fact that draft history is going to tell us
*  that there's going to be somebody that goes after five that maybe is better than one of the guys that goes in the top three.
*  Probably not the guy that's number one. But I like Scoot.
*  Okay. We're both Scoot guys. We've been saying it for a few weeks now, at least.
*  I don't know that I'd want to give up the chance of having Scoot for Jalen Green, who despite his talent,
*  I think is a high points guy on a team that just let him take a million shots that he and Kevin Porter just got to shoot the whole time.
*  I agree with you. I would rather have Scoot, but I could also talk myself into this trade
*  because I feel like I could get somebody awesome at number four.
*  And I'm getting two swings at the town apple with Jalen Green and number four versus one.
*  Houston, I would just do it. Like, fine.
*  But I'm giving up Jalen Green and two Brooklyn firsts and number 27. Sign me up.
*  And then New Orleans gets the culture changer in Scoot. This is a fun one.
*  Let's take a break and then I have a couple more to throw you.
*  So we definitely said no, then we said no. Who is the leading?
*  No, but it's fun. Who's leading the charge in the no there? New Orleans?
*  No, I think the New Orleans does that. I think the New Orleans is the most psyched.
*  Yeah, they get number two and Terry Roger and two firsts. I'm doing that. I'm taking Scoot. I'm delighted.
*  That was a really good one because you're looking at Houston saying, all right, you missed out.
*  I think Houston would say yes to that in two seconds. I think they would too.
*  You
