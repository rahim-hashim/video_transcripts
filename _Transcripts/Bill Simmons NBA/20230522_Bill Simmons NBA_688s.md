# Can the Celtics Actually Justify Bringing Joe Mazzulla Back Next Year? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo)
*  I feel bad 15 years ago, I would have been destroying this coach week after week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=0.0s)]
*  And I would add nicknames for him and done the whole thing, but I [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=3.7800000000000002s)]
*  actually feel bad for him. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=6.84s)]
*  I think he was in a horrible situation. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=7.86s)]
*  Like Brian Barrett on our Boston pod did a really nice job Friday night of talking [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=10.26s)]
*  about like how long Darwin Ham was an assistant coach right before he got the job. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=14.76s)]
*  How long Mike Malone's been in the NBA, you know, even somebody like Spolstra who [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=19.2s)]
*  worked under Riley for years and then finally got the job and then had that first [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=25.0s)]
*  year where they're all trying to get him fired. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=28.92s)]
*  Um, and then Joe Maz, you know, two years is basically sitting in the second row. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  That's what my dad calls him second row Joe. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=36.24s)]
*  And he just gets thrown in with this like skeleton coaching staff, you know, and, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=38.84s)]
*  and I can't think of a worse situation that a new coach has been thrown into. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=43.160000000000004s)]
*  It's not like they could have hired somebody else. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=48.64s)]
*  It was the season was about to start. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Wasn't like people were sitting around. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=52.32000000000001s)]
*  I still think they handled it badly. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=54.56s)]
*  I still think they really underestimated the value of having that one experience [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=56.04s)]
*  dude on the bench. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=60.36s)]
*  Um, but I also thought he was terrible. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=61.76s)]
*  Like I really genuinely think he was terrible, like terrible as a coach in the, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=64.44s)]
*  in the NBA playoffs. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=69.64s)]
*  I thought he was terrible in the Hawk series. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=70.88s)]
*  I have no idea how that went to six. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=72.6s)]
*  The Philly, he didn't even start making adjustments until game six and then game [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=74.72s)]
*  seven, then this series predictably, he got annihilated by Spolstra. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=78.76s)]
*  I mean, that, this was checkers versus chess and I feel bad for him because I [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=84.12s)]
*  don't think he should have been in the position. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=88.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  But we go back to the timeline. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=92.84s)]
*  They were screwed. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=94.0s)]
*  They were screwed. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=95.56s)]
*  They were screwed unless they were going to bring in Vogel. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=96.92s)]
*  You know, um, I don't think Brad wants to coach. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=100.92s)]
*  I don't know if they'll beg him. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=105.64s)]
*  So are you saying he should be fired? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=107.44s)]
*  I don't think he will come back. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=111.0s)]
*  I think they will move on and get, and get a bigger coach because especially with [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=114.04s)]
*  the amount of money that the ownership is shelling out for salaries, if you're [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=118.44s)]
*  not going to make a major move, you can't bring the coach back and say, Hey, we [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=122.8s)]
*  got him a really good bench coast. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  This year is going to be different. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=127.92s)]
*  I just, it felt like he lost the team in this series. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=130.12s)]
*  I've been watching basketball my whole life. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=133.52s)]
*  You can kind of see when a team's that team's kind of done. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=135.32s)]
*  And is the, are the guys done with each other? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=139.16s)]
*  Are they done with the coaching situation? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=140.96s)]
*  What is it? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  This is a team that over and over again, just got outwitted and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=143.0s)]
*  out executed down the stretch. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=145.52s)]
*  So the other thing, so this is one of the things I was thinking. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=147.36s)]
*  I was thinking about like the most frustrating, really good teams [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=150.28s)]
*  that I've watched in my lifetime. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=153.32s)]
*  And the number one version of this was the Drexel Blazers team, which had [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=155.6s)]
*  this really nice run from 89 to 92. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=160.96s)]
*  They made the finals in 90. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  They made the finals in 92, the 90 finals. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=165.76s)]
*  They absolutely could have won. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=169.08s)]
*  They beat the Lakers in a playoff series. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=170.76s)]
*  They had just a shitload of talent. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=172.52s)]
*  They were really athletic. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=174.8s)]
*  They were deep. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=176.36s)]
*  They were a lot like the Celtics team. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=177.08s)]
*  And yet over and over again, they'd shoot themselves in the foot and they'd [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=179.32000000000002s)]
*  blow games, they'd lose close games. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  They just do dumb things and you could always kind of out with them. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=183.84s)]
*  And it just was who they were. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=188.44s)]
*  And they kind of left this legacy of, man, that team was so talented, hard [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=190.24s)]
*  to believe they didn't win a title. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=193.44s)]
*  And I fear that that's the Celtics run. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=195.52s)]
*  It's the same kind of thing, except in this case, Stevens was such a good [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=198.04000000000002s)]
*  coach and Eme did such a good job last year. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=202.0s)]
*  Last year was like, oh, they're a year ahead of schedule. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=205.12s)]
*  Just wait these next few years. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=207.96s)]
*  And remember we talked last year and I was saying to you about, I know this is [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=209.8s)]
*  a young team, but I've seen this happen too many times with the NBA with Windows. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=214.08s)]
*  And I think there's real urgency for this team to win because I don't know [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=219.2s)]
*  what's going to happen next year. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=222.08s)]
*  This might be their best chance right now. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=223.56s)]
*  You said it in 20. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=226.2s)]
*  And I was kind of like, yeah. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=227.88s)]
*  Yeah, no, I mean, I get it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=232.2s)]
*  I'm asking in 20, but you know, a lot of it, you can start mapping it out going, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=233.52s)]
*  okay, well what's going to happen around them, right? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=239.52s)]
*  And in 20, there were a bunch of, I'm not going to remember all of them where [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=241.56s)]
*  you're like, this might be their best chance. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=245.28s)]
*  And really when you're in a finals, it feels like it's probably your best chance. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=247.04s)]
*  You're not going to get to go back all the time. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=249.44s)]
*  And it's actually pretty rare. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=251.2s)]
*  If you were to say that now about this team, I don't, I don't know that that [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=254.4s)]
*  would be true. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=257.16s)]
*  I mean, other than writing off Miami all the time, like I do, uh, I don't think [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=258.32s)]
*  you'd go into next year going, Oh no, look at the Miami heat. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=263.8s)]
*  They're going to win 55 games unless the roster changes. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=267.52000000000004s)]
*  The Milwaukee thing might actually enter into weird phase. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=270.56s)]
*  The Philly thing could easily be worse. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=274.56s)]
*  There's shades of weirdness with them with the Milwaukee thing. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=276.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=279.8s)]
*  Um, Atlanta's whatever Toronto's whatever the Knicks got some work to do. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=280.36s)]
*  And then there's Cleveland who maybe that was the young team getting their ass [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=286.64s)]
*  kicked and all the regular season numbers, meaning nothing, you know, that [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=290.64s)]
*  was the best defensive team in the league. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=294.36s)]
*  And they couldn't get stops against what's a lot of times, you know, a pretty [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=295.92s)]
*  heavy one man show offensively. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=300.04s)]
*  Um, it, you know, looking at it, you positioning the Celtics and saying, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=302.84000000000003s)]
*  okay, they actually are going to be one of the favorites to win the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=307.76s)]
*  East already next year. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=311.52s)]
*  They just are. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=313.48s)]
*  If they don't, if they do nothing and they hire an expensive bench coach [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=314.48s)]
*  and keep Joe mass, they don't do anything. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=318.24s)]
*  You still think they're one of the favorites. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=320.16s)]
*  Well, the bench, you might be right. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=322.04s)]
*  I think the bench coach thing is mandatory. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=323.92s)]
*  It's mandatory. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=326.04s)]
*  And, you know, I don't see how they can bring, I honestly don't [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=326.88s)]
*  see how they can bring them back. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=331.16s)]
*  I know they extended them halfway through the season, but I [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=332.12s)]
*  thought he was that bad. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=334.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=337.08000000000004s)]
*  Cause I, I, I struggle with it. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=337.24s)]
*  I'm, I'm not defending it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=338.84000000000003s)]
*  The not doubling Jimmy and letting that happen freely and not changing things up. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=339.96s)]
*  And whenever a team is losing and they're throwing shit against the wall, the same [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=344.79999999999995s)]
*  way we saw Monte Williams and Phoenix, like, as I'm watching it going, like, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  you don't, you have like no clue, like what you're going to get from her. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  You know, like, you don't want, you don't know what to do here right now. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=353.84s)]
*  How about five playoff losses in two, in two rounds and three games. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=356.52s)]
*  They lose at home five times. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=362.2s)]
*  They, they were 30, four and, uh, no, no, no. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=364.56s)]
*  They were, they lost nine times at home in the regular season. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=369.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=373.36s)]
*  They lost at home. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=373.52s)]
*  And they lost five in the playoffs. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=375.71999999999997s)]
*  I went to the nuggets game last night and I'm thinking this nuggets [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=376.24s)]
*  team is going to kill the Celtics with their movement and how smart they are [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=379.28s)]
*  and how smart Jokic is, he's going to dissect them the same way Butler is. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=383.0s)]
*  You know, it's just that they wouldn't have had a chance against that team. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=386.84s)]
*  Not the way they're playing now. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=389.48s)]
*  I will never, the best case you could make for it's the coach's fault. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=390.92s)]
*  And I think we, I even agree with you. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=395.15999999999997s)]
*  Sometimes it's just too easy to blame the coach. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=397.32s)]
*  And by the way, like real quick on that, the turnovers at the end of game one. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=399.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=406.44s)]
*  The turnovers where they're like throwing it to Jimmy Butler in center field. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=407.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=413.92s)]
*  And you know, to not have that many fouls and have that many steals and look, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  Jaylen Brown against a smart defensive team, you know, they're all like, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=417.6s)]
*  Hey dude, can't dribble. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=420.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=422.4s)]
*  Dude can't. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=422.64s)]
*  He's going to throw cross-court passes. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=423.15999999999997s)]
*  A couple of the drives that Jaylen Brown had tonight into the, and when he's just [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=425.2s)]
*  falling down and everybody's looking at him, be like, what are you? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=428.16s)]
*  So like, that's the kind of stuff where I'm like, wait, that's [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=430.92s)]
*  Missoula's fault and it isn't. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=433.0s)]
*  But there's, there's, there's enough other stuff with not having a different [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=435.6s)]
*  attach a plan of attack for Butler. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=441.20000000000005s)]
*  Um, you know, against a zone, you guys just stop running offense. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=444.0s)]
*  Like there's a, there's like three things you can do against the zone. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=448.16s)]
*  Dribbling the ball straight up into his own, for some reason. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=450.40000000000003s)]
*  Hey, fundamentally they have all the same guys as last year, plus Brockton. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=453.20000000000005s)]
*  How is this team so much worse on defense? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=457.36s)]
*  Like that, that's just fundamentally, how's that possible? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=459.76s)]
*  All of these guys are a year older and a year smarter, right? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=462.32s)]
*  And they've been in a bunch of big games. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=465.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=466.6s)]
*  They may not score and that's what was their undoing against Golden State. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=467.16s)]
*  They could always default back to like, we have a pretty special defense. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=470.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=474.36s)]
*  And even in game four of the finals, they lose, they lose cause Steph just [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=474.6s)]
*  leaves his body in the second half. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=478.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=480.6s)]
*  They were playing good defense that whole series. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=481.16s)]
*  And then the offensively is where they lost it. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=484.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=487.12s)]
*  And you know, the, I'm glad you brought up the Jalen turnovers thing, the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=487.36s)]
*  unforced turnovers with him, it's been a problem all season. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=490.72s)]
*  Um, I don't know if there was something like really wrong with his hand, but [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=494.08s)]
*  it's just turnovers. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=497.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=499.28s)]
*  They aren't just turnovers. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=499.52s)]
*  Look, I looked at, remember last year when they played Miami and they win the [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=501.24s)]
*  game seven down there, but you know, if you go through it game by game in the [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=505.44s)]
*  turnovers, I was looking at like one game, they were plus 15 in turnovers. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=512.48s)]
*  That's an impossible number. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=518.04s)]
*  It's like one thing to have like more than 10 than the team you played against. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=519.4s)]
*  Um, you know, it's, it's a joke with them. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=523.28s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=526.96s)]
*  Look, let's take it back to the coach thing though. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=528.2s)]
*  It's, uh, Oh, cause I had a fake trade for you that I'm almost nervous to present. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=530.0s)]
*  Let's save it, save it for a second. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=535.8000000000001s)]
*  Cause, cause I think there's a, a problem. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=537.04s)]
*  And I don't, you know, this is the part of being in ownership and being Brad Stevens [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=540.52s)]
*  where you go, how, what will the reaction be if Missoula is canned after one year? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=546.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=553.8s)]
*  Now it's actually happened a lot more in NBA history and sometimes it can be a [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=554.88s)]
*  little deceiving with the, was he the interim and then had the job going into [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=558.36s)]
*  the next year and then was fired. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=562.68s)]
*  So was it, is it hired one full season then fires a little bit of carryover. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=564.08s)]
*  But I think the numbers at like 21 coaches, so it's happened a lot. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=568.36s)]
*  It hasn't happened a lot recently. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=572.2s)]
*  It just happens in football too. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=574.2800000000001s)]
*  But sometimes I think when Riley fired Van Gundy right before the, uh, or during [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=576.5600000000001s)]
*  the 06, I can't remember the timeline before they won the title, he replaced [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=583.08s)]
*  them with himself in Van Getty, allegedly had to leave because he wanted to spend [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=586.2s)]
*  more time with his family or something, but he got fired by Riley basically. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=590.88s)]
*  Riley just sense like, I have this window, I have this talented team, and this is [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=594.36s)]
*  the wrong coach and I got to do something. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=599.0400000000001s)]
*  If you're the Celtics, you're a luxury tax team. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=601.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=603.9200000000001s)]
*  Tatum was 25 who's about to enter NBA history would tell us he's still not the [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=603.96s)]
*  player that he's going to end up being two years from now, right? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=608.24s)]
*  Even somebody like Yokech even went up a level this year, 27, 28 are the key years [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=610.4000000000001s)]
*  for an NBA super duper star. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=615.2800000000001s)]
*  So we don't even know what his ceiling is. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=617.12s)]
*  Not to mention all the other luxury tax, all the other stuff that he's done, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=619.12s)]
*  all the other luxury tax, all the other stuff they're showing out and they don't [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=622.4s)]
*  really have picks. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=625.52s)]
*  There's no real way to rebuild. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=626.1999999999999s)]
*  Um, you can't fuck around with a coach again. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=628.1999999999999s)]
*  You can't be like, man, well, maybe hopefully Joe will be better this year. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=630.52s)]
*  I just don't think they can do that. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=633.72s)]
*  And the reality is it's if they did get rid of them, I don't know who hires them. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=635.48s)]
*  You know, they, it's not just that they lost the email last year. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=641.0799999999999s)]
*  They lost. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=643.72s)]
*  Will Hardy too, which we talked about last summer and we talked about how [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=644.72s)]
*  important he was. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=647.84s)]
*  Um, that combo is pretty devastating. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=649.24s)]
*  So they, they're going to have to, they're going to have to think like, do we want to [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=652.88s)]
*  risk another year here because we just squandered a year where Miami is going to [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=657.88s)]
*  make the finals after they went 44 and 38, they lost the playing game. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=662.24s)]
*  And in the fourth quarter of the second playing game, it could have gone either [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=666.72s)]
*  way against the bulls who are now about to blow it up. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=669.36s)]
*  So I, my guess is that he's probably, uh, probably going to get bounced. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eifOK73q8mo&t=672.3199999999999s)]
