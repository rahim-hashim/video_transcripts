# NBA Magic Vs. Cavaliers Game 7 LIVE Playoffs Reaction with Bill Simmons and Ryen Russillo
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q)
*  Really? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=0.0s)]
*  seen it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=180.0s)]
*  Then you watch a game like [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=206.86s)]
*  He really, really, really gives a shit about every game. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=209.6s)]
*  It's great. I love it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=213.1s)]
*  This is a long, sustained offensive excellence [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=214.44s)]
*  that when you watch it, feels legitimate. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=218.44s)]
*  We're not gonna be nice. What do we care? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=220.78s)]
*  We're just these... Let's call it what it is. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=222.48s)]
*  -â™ª God wait, change your mind, man, you're funny... [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=224.78s)]
*  All right, we are live on YouTube. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=230.92s)]
*  I wish my voice worked. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  It is 1252 p.m. Sunday. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=235.56s)]
*  Just watch the Cleveland Cavaliers outlast the Orlando Magic. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=238.56s)]
*  We're taping the first part of the BS podcast right now. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=242.6s)]
*  Ryan Rosillo is here, AKA Red Light Rosillo. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=244.84s)]
*  We are gonna dedicate this episode [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=249.7s)]
*  to Franz Wagner's trade stock, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=252.6s)]
*  which took a massive hit today, Rosillo. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=254.98s)]
*  But let's start positive with the Cavs. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=257.52s)]
*  It got dark there in the second quarter. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=259.82s)]
*  I was preparing for this pod, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=263.12s)]
*  and I'm just on trade machine making up Mitchell trades. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=265.68s)]
*  I'm looking at the Cavs' salaries. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=269.16s)]
*  I'm like, would they trade Mitchell and Jared Allen? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=271.0s)]
*  Is Mobley available? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=273.5s)]
*  Is Bickerstaff gonna get fired at halftime? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=275.16s)]
*  Fans are booing. It just seemed bleak. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=278.16s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, near the end of the second quarter, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=281.74s)]
*  it started to flip. They're down 10 and halftime. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=283.8s)]
*  And then second half took over. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=286.48s)]
*  Did you think that was it for Cleveland [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=289.02000000000004s)]
*  at any point during that game? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=290.44000000000005s)]
*  No, not at all, because I just know Orlando's offense, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=292.74s)]
*  especially on the road. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=295.88000000000005s)]
*  And really, Paolo was keeping him alive, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=297.34000000000003s)]
*  not so much with his shot making, but his free throws. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=299.48s)]
*  So when it was 49-31, look, no matter who it is, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=302.62s)]
*  unless it's just a complete mismatch, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=306.38000000000005s)]
*  I feel like even as bad as games get, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=308.02000000000004s)]
*  someone's gonna make some kind of push. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=309.82000000000005s)]
*  And this is why you have a Mitchell, who at his best, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=311.72s)]
*  if he had qualified, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=314.5s)]
*  I probably would have voted him all NBA this year. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=315.8s)]
*  And even though I know he's not perfect, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=317.54s)]
*  he can just take over games with his aggressiveness. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  And I thought he realized it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=323.26s)]
*  LaVert finally had a decent game. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=324.3s)]
*  Strews showed up in the third quarter. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=325.7s)]
*  And you're probably trying to figure out [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=327.8s)]
*  if you could trade Garland at some point too. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=330.03999999999996s)]
*  But it was 49-31. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=332.3s)]
*  And then from that point on, and the final score's different, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  but it was 99-87 Cleveland. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=338.14s)]
*  And a 12-point deficit for Orlando [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=339.84s)]
*  seems insurmountable with this offense. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=341.52s)]
*  Over that time, Cleveland outscored him 68 to 38. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=343.68s)]
*  So was there a result from this series [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=346.26s)]
*  that was actually going to make you feel drastically different [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=350.78s)]
*  about either one of the roster questions? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=353.02s)]
*  That's a good question actually, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=357.35999999999996s)]
*  because the result I think here [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=358.68s)]
*  was that they didn't have Jared Allen in this game. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=361.52s)]
*  And I just kinda like watching the Cavs more [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=363.79999999999995s)]
*  when they have one big guy instead of two. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=365.96s)]
*  Which I felt that way when Mowby was out there [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=368.0s)]
*  in the season and Jared Allen was the lone big guy. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=370.56s)]
*  Just seems like when they have more space, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=374.09999999999997s)]
*  they're more interesting. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=375.78s)]
*  Mowby, I think he had five or six turnovers in this game, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=377.4s)]
*  but there was some rebounding shot blocking stuff he did [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=382.3s)]
*  and shot intimidation stuff [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=385.8s)]
*  that I thought was pretty important. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=388.44s)]
*  I like how he played. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=389.88s)]
*  He's still a little sloppy, he's still a little clumsy, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=390.91999999999996s)]
*  he's still a little weird around the rim, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=392.78s)]
*  but and he still feels like a little bit [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  of a work in progress. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=395.56s)]
*  And when you compare him to people like Edwards and Palo, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=397.28s)]
*  who were just precociously dominating [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=400.5s)]
*  as alphas in these playoff games, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=402.76s)]
*  he seems super young compared to them. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=404.32s)]
*  But yeah, that was the only result I had was [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  what do they do with Allen? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=411.12s)]
*  Cause if the Celtics waxed them in round two, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=412.36s)]
*  does that really change that much for them? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=414.4s)]
*  I think the Mitchell thing, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=416.12s)]
*  Mitchell kinda needed those last couple games here. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=417.48s)]
*  Cause I was looking back, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=420.2s)]
*  he had 12 playoff games going back from 2022 [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=422.24s)]
*  through game four Orlando, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=425.76s)]
*  where he was 21 a game, 42% field goal. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=428.24s)]
*  He had four wins, he was four and eight in those games. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=432.0s)]
*  And then game five, it felt like he got going. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=434.24s)]
*  I thought that was an important win for them. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=435.96s)]
*  Cause I really, it really seemed like Orlando [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=437.52s)]
*  was gonna steal that game. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=438.91999999999996s)]
*  Game six, he has 50. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=440.32s)]
*  Today he was awesome. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=442.2s)]
*  And I feel like he's kind of reestablished himself [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=443.28s)]
*  as the asset that I think deep down, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=445.68s)]
*  we all felt like he was, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=448.35999999999996s)]
*  but we hadn't seen it on this stage [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=449.46s)]
*  in a couple of years until this week. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=451.28s)]
*  I'm pretty sure the league though, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=455.2s)]
*  would look at him and go, okay, if he's available, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=456.28s)]
*  and he wants to resign with us, like we'll take him, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=457.91999999999996s)]
*  which I think was the debate about the New York decision [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=460.64s)]
*  and the Cleveland decision at the time. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=463.4s)]
*  And we sit around and we talk about these teams [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=465.54s)]
*  and we critique them for some of the trades. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=467.78000000000003s)]
*  And it's like, well, what are we supposed to do? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=469.3s)]
*  Wait for the first team all NBA guy? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=470.58000000000004s)]
*  We're supposed to wait to be a perfect fit for him. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=473.5s)]
*  So if Cleveland had been balanced, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=475.62s)]
*  it would have been more disappointing [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=476.82s)]
*  cause it's a two years with the Mitchell Garland thing [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=477.90000000000003s)]
*  that I still think has questions. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=480.18s)]
*  You're absolutely right about the Allen Mowgli part, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=481.62s)]
*  but to not have Allen as a possibility [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=483.7s)]
*  when he's 17 and 14 in the series isn't a good thing. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=486.46000000000004s)]
*  But it makes it like, granted he's not playing. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=489.94s)]
*  So that means Mowgli is gonna be split with these guys, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=493.62s)]
*  but it just was gonna feel more disappointing [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=496.66s)]
*  if Cleveland lost game seven at home. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=499.62s)]
*  But we're gonna be asking the same stuff [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=503.18s)]
*  if they get smoked by Boston. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=506.14s)]
*  So whatever you think you were gonna ask today, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=508.38s)]
*  if they lost, if they don't beat Boston, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=510.66s)]
*  and if it's a quick series, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=513.26s)]
*  we're just gonna delay the questions we were asking today. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=515.34s)]
*  And as far as Orlando, if they had gotten this one, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=517.46s)]
*  it's like, okay, Paulo, check, man, Franz, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=519.78s)]
*  he needs to be a better two option. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=523.3399999999999s)]
*  They need shooting, maybe they need playmaking. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=525.8199999999999s)]
*  They were gonna need those things [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=527.98s)]
*  even if it was a competitive second round. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=529.74s)]
*  So sometimes the distance in the playoffs, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=532.02s)]
*  I think tricks us into talking about teams differently. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=534.8199999999999s)]
*  When I was just watching this one, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=537.9399999999999s)]
*  I was like, every single concern I've had [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=539.1s)]
*  about either one of these teams is just evident [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=540.86s)]
*  and then some team's gonna win it. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=543.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=545.38s)]
*  I think the one difference though is if Orlando loses, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=546.5s)]
*  they were playing with house money, it's a game seven. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=549.06s)]
*  I think we made a lot of young guys in this series, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=551.26s)]
*  Suggs and Franz, I think were three for 25 at one point. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=553.4200000000001s)]
*  And Garland on the other end wasn't playing well either. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=557.5s)]
*  These game sevens, national TV, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=559.7s)]
*  when the crowd gets nervous, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=562.1s)]
*  it's just a different energy and atmosphere. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=563.5s)]
*  We both been to game sevens, I've been to a lot of them. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=565.46s)]
*  And it just feels different [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=568.5s)]
*  from the moment you're in the building. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=570.0600000000001s)]
*  I think where the stakes were higher for Cleveland [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=571.78s)]
*  was the way that second quarter was going [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=575.94s)]
*  when the crowd was booing. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=577.86s)]
*  And it just was like, man, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=579.94s)]
*  if they lose by 20 at home in a game seven, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=582.7s)]
*  what happens to this team? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=586.6600000000001s)]
*  It felt like Bicker steps out probably the next day, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=588.34s)]
*  Mitchell, the trade start immediately. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=592.74s)]
*  And then it's like, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=595.62s)]
*  do we just keep two of Garland, Mobley, Allen? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=596.46s)]
*  What do we do? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=598.9000000000001s)]
*  It felt like an explosion for about 10, 15 minutes there. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=599.74s)]
*  Part of the problem for Orlando is Palo was putting up site. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=605.1800000000001s)]
*  Did you see him at the end [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=608.74s)]
*  when they showed him that closeup? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=609.74s)]
*  He was like, there's different levels of tired. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=611.58s)]
*  He was, I'm gonna puke tired. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=614.14s)]
*  They were showing him, he looked like when I, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=616.34s)]
*  that stupid MTV challenge show that I watched [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=618.22s)]
*  when they're pushing the guys too far [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=620.38s)]
*  and they just bend over and start puking. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=622.62s)]
*  And it was like, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=624.94s)]
*  is Palo just gonna start throwing up on the court? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=625.78s)]
*  That's how tired he was, but he was getting no help. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=628.02s)]
*  So anyway, I thought it was a really dangerous [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=630.74s)]
*  half hour there for Cleveland that they fought off. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=633.46s)]
*  Now if they get swept by Boston, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=636.74s)]
*  all the same questions get asked, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=638.38s)]
*  but I don't think at the same level of intensity, right? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=639.9s)]
*  No, because that one clearly they're not expected to win [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=643.02s)]
*  even though I thought this series [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=645.66s)]
*  was gonna be pretty close. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=646.66s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=648.1s)]
*  If Cleveland doesn't get game seven at home [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=649.5s)]
*  with this group for the second year, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=651.5s)]
*  because last year was a disappointment against New York. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=653.58s)]
*  So yeah, it means more to them, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=655.74s)]
*  the outcome to go ahead and get this win. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=659.7s)]
*  But on the Orlando side of this, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=661.98s)]
*  and you're always bringing this up [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=663.86s)]
*  and there's just constant reminders. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=666.02s)]
*  And I don't know if it's game seven, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=667.86s)]
*  I don't know if it's being young in the first time through, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=668.9399999999999s)]
*  but Frans and Suggs ended up three of 28 in this one. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=671.38s)]
*  Frans is- [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=675.06s)]
*  I didn't know it got worse. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=675.9s)]
*  I saw that three of 25. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=676.86s)]
*  Jesus, three and 28? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=678.3s)]
*  Three for 28, Frans one at 15, OFI from three. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=680.22s)]
*  And I brought this up a couple of weeks ago [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=684.6999999999999s)]
*  where when we really liked Frans, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=687.62s)]
*  it was like, where's the hole in his game? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=690.18s)]
*  Like the best version of was, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=692.98s)]
*  okay, he can put it on the floor. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=694.6999999999999s)]
*  He's got all the size, he's a good defender [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=696.2199999999999s)]
*  and he can shoot it. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=699.14s)]
*  And when you look at his college stats, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=701.02s)]
*  like even if the scouting report on him [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=702.62s)]
*  was that you didn't have to respect the shot enough, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=703.98s)]
*  there was still enough of a percentage there [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=705.98s)]
*  where you felt like it was gonna develop into something [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=708.62s)]
*  on top of his free throw shooting, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=710.98s)]
*  which is what scouts always look at. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=712.2199999999999s)]
*  Like, okay, maybe if I don't love the three point numbers [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=713.66s)]
*  or don't love the way the shot always looks, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=715.62s)]
*  like there's something to work there. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=717.02s)]
*  And it became evident there was just a lot of times [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=718.4599999999999s)]
*  in these games where Frans didn't even trust himself. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=721.06s)]
*  And they even brought it up in the broadcast [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=723.34s)]
*  where he said to them, I think it was with Salters [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=724.74s)]
*  where he's like, I know I'm a better shooter than this. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=727.34s)]
*  It's like, well, you've got to have to fight [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=728.98s)]
*  through that doubt because then he starts getting [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=730.7800000000001s)]
*  a little clunky with it and he's kind of just finding [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=733.74s)]
*  like he's going to the hoop, but you could see [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=736.98s)]
*  he was just really, really struggling with it. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=739.46s)]
*  So then you go, okay, Suggs isn't making shots. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=741.1800000000001s)]
*  He's not making shots and Palo had- [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=743.38s)]
*  Suggs wasn't afraid to shoot, which was the difference. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=745.58s)]
*  Frans had a couple of possessions and you could just see it, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=748.0600000000001s)]
*  especially if you've ever played basketball, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=751.9s)]
*  you can see it in somebody's demeanor. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=753.6999999999999s)]
*  It's like, oh, that guy doesn't want to shoot. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=756.1s)]
*  Duh, you see it all the time in these games. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=757.62s)]
*  And Cleveland started sagging off him [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=759.34s)]
*  and he was like, oh fuck, I still don't want to shoot. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=762.06s)]
*  Hey, does anybody want to come over and set a screen for me [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=764.3s)]
*  so I can try to get to the basket? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=766.62s)]
*  It was pretty brutal. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=768.22s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm not sure how Orlando could ever win this game. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=770.06s)]
*  If you're like, okay, this is what the second [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=774.6999999999999s)]
*  and third options, they're going to shoot three at 28. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=776.78s)]
*  No, there was a way for them to win though, Rossello. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=779.34s)]
*  It was with defense. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=781.54s)]
*  I think they win a rock fight, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=783.54s)]
*  which is like if you were going to pick Orlando [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=784.98s)]
*  in this game, the over-under I think got to 195. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=786.8199999999999s)]
*  It went up after Jared Allen went out. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=789.38s)]
*  Orlando was like plus four. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=792.02s)]
*  And if you're going to pick Orlando, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=794.14s)]
*  it is like a 78 to 73 final or an 88 to 81. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=795.8199999999999s)]
*  It's one of those types of games, right? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=800.18s)]
*  The problem for them is Mitchell got going [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=801.6999999999999s)]
*  and then Strews out of nowhere became Miami Strews again [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=804.0999999999999s)]
*  for like five minutes and he hit those three threes. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=807.86s)]
*  He did 33 points in the third quarter. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=810.5799999999999s)]
*  And that was what swung the game. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=813.78s)]
*  But I think there was a recipe for Orlando to win [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=815.62s)]
*  where it was just ugly. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=818.3399999999999s)]
*  And Palo was getting to the line over and over again. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=819.42s)]
*  Mitchell was three for 13 in the first half [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=821.74s)]
*  and it felt like he just couldn't get it going. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=824.78s)]
*  And then that meant nobody on Cleveland [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=826.5799999999999s)]
*  was going to get it going, but then he got it going. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=828.26s)]
*  But this is why you pay Mitchell. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=830.2199999999999s)]
*  This is why there'll still be demand for Mitchell [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=831.3s)]
*  because in the gossipy world of the NBA, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=832.98s)]
*  there's not anyone that I've talked to [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=836.5799999999999s)]
*  that thinks that he would actually tell them, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=838.38s)]
*  hey, I'm going to sign here. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=840.22s)]
*  So all of this may be delaying the stuff [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=841.26s)]
*  that we talked about at the beginning. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=843.46s)]
*  But as imperfect as you can argue Mitchell can be, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=844.5s)]
*  I've talked about the downside of him [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=848.9s)]
*  being a little peak Westbrook lightish [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=850.5s)]
*  where he'll just go like, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=852.7s)]
*  I gotta do this all on my own. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=853.74s)]
*  Well, sometimes you need that, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=855.78s)]
*  especially when there's nothing from Garland. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=857.34s)]
*  LaVert hadn't been good until this game. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=859.1800000000001s)]
*  I mean, Garland, if they lose this one, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=861.5s)]
*  then it turns into a bad Garland summer. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=863.6600000000001s)]
*  So who knows? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=866.14s)]
*  Although he had a really important stretch there late [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=867.98s)]
*  where he got the steal on Suggs after the inbound [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=870.5400000000001s)]
*  when the game still felt like it was in play. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=872.3800000000001s)]
*  He then hits a shot, then gets a rebound. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=874.58s)]
*  So I'm reaching for my peak Garland. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=877.5400000000001s)]
*  And he was playing hard. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=879.7s)]
*  I can make a Garland defense for five seconds. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=881.1800000000001s)]
*  I like Garland, so go ahead. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=884.5400000000001s)]
*  I like him a lot. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=886.0200000000001s)]
*  And that broken jaw thing is not a small thing [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=887.1400000000001s)]
*  if you're a basketball player [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=890.34s)]
*  and you're coming back from a real injury to your face [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=891.58s)]
*  and you're a guard. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=896.2600000000001s)]
*  And I just think it fucks with your head a little bit. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=897.3399999999999s)]
*  I was looking at his stats. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=899.8199999999999s)]
*  Two years ago, he was basically 22 and nine [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=901.06s)]
*  before the Mitchell trade, right? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=904.6999999999999s)]
*  And then it's gone backwards. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=906.0999999999999s)]
*  Now he's a 17 and six guy. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=907.3399999999999s)]
*  But I don't have questions about him yet. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=909.06s)]
*  I didn't love how he played today, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=912.26s)]
*  but I also think he had a really weird season. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=913.9s)]
*  The Mitchell one- [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=917.4599999999999s)]
*  He just shot less too. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=918.3s)]
*  He was taking even less shots in this series. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=919.14s)]
*  So I think that's gonna happen once- [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=922.26s)]
*  Doesn't have the ball a lot. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=923.4599999999999s)]
*  Once Mitchell decides, okay, I think the only thing, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=924.66s)]
*  we need eight Superman minutes. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=927.58s)]
*  And Mitchell, even with the flaws, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=928.6600000000001s)]
*  is capable of doing that in a way [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=931.2600000000001s)]
*  that there's just not a long list of players in the league. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=933.22s)]
*  Well, a couple things helped Mitchell in this game. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=936.1800000000001s)]
*  I don't think Suggs was the Suggs from the regular season [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=939.3800000000001s)]
*  really since he got hurt earlier in the year. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=943.74s)]
*  And that's not an excuse for Orlando [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=946.58s)]
*  because Mitchell made some great shots. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=949.0200000000001s)]
*  But I just, I watched Suggs this year [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=950.5400000000001s)]
*  and he was a better defender than he was, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=952.74s)]
*  especially in this game. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=955.46s)]
*  Every time there was a break, he was limping around. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=957.26s)]
*  It seemed like he had like five different injuries. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=959.74s)]
*  And I just think he was really banged up. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=961.62s)]
*  The other thing was, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=963.7s)]
*  I thought Mosley really helped Cleveland [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=965.38s)]
*  with not using Isaac enough. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=967.26s)]
*  I didn't understand the Isaac use at all. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=969.98s)]
*  He put him on Mitchell for two possessions. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=972.18s)]
*  I think at the start of the fourth quarter, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=975.22s)]
*  and I was like, here we go. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=976.62s)]
*  Where the fuck was this all game? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=977.82s)]
*  And the first time they got him in a pick [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=979.7s)]
*  and Mitchell was able to get by whoever the switch was. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=981.22s)]
*  And the second time he took like a bad 28 footer over him. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=983.94s)]
*  But Isaac was doing that Bill Russell time machine thing. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=987.1400000000001s)]
*  And I was like, this is how they get back in it. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=990.4200000000001s)]
*  Just put Isaac on Mitchell for five minutes here. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=992.2600000000001s)]
*  And then Mosley took him out. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=995.34s)]
*  Mosley I thought was all over the map in this game. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=996.34s)]
*  He played 10 guys. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=998.9000000000001s)]
*  I just, in game seven, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1000.5400000000001s)]
*  he might be the first guy that played 10 guys [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1002.34s)]
*  in a game seven in like 20 years. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1004.22s)]
*  I'd love to see the stats on that. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1006.3000000000001s)]
*  His rotations were all over the place. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1007.9000000000001s)]
*  Franz didn't have it at all. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1009.94s)]
*  And he just kind of kept putting the offense in his hands. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1012.06s)]
*  I just didn't understand the coaching. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1015.3399999999999s)]
*  The second unit was so good a few games ago [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1018.6199999999999s)]
*  where I thought it like changed the game for them. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1022.38s)]
*  I think that was game four. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1026.3799999999999s)]
*  And maybe there's part of it where he felt like, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1028.54s)]
*  okay, that was worth it. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1032.1s)]
*  Maybe he's afraid of putting Isaac straight up on Mitchell [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1033.1s)]
*  and then they just screen him [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1036.1399999999999s)]
*  and now Isaac's away from everything. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1037.7s)]
*  And I'm just trying to figure it out. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1039.78s)]
*  In 50, trying to think here, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1041.82s)]
*  the last 50, 61 minutes, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1043.74s)]
*  Isaac made four shots. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1046.5s)]
*  So for an offense. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1047.86s)]
*  Right, you can't have him and Franz [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1049.58s)]
*  out there at the same time. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1050.8999999999999s)]
*  Right, with Suggs also missing everything. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1051.86s)]
*  But maybe the way to do it was just like, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1054.1s)]
*  we're just gonna try to stop you on defense every time [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1057.22s)]
*  and let's have the final score of this game be 70. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1059.94s)]
*  Like a 2004 playoff game. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1062.46s)]
*  The final score will be 74 to 71 [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1064.98s)]
*  and we're gonna contest and switch on everything. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1067.1399999999999s)]
*  Look, this is why you have game seven at home. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1070.54s)]
*  Because I think if game seven is in Orlando, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1073.82s)]
*  I think Orlando wins. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1076.82s)]
*  So the regular season still matters for Sillow. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1078.26s)]
*  Still matters. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1080.94s)]
*  O'Coro too, by the way, with his assignment on Palo, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1081.78s)]
*  I thought just worked his ass off. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1086.26s)]
*  Did a good job. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1088.54s)]
*  And as much as we all love Palo, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1089.3799999999999s)]
*  I think there are times where he can kind of [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1092.3799999999999s)]
*  get himself stuck because he's so big, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1093.98s)]
*  he can pass out of any... [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1096.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1098.3799999999999s)]
*  And then once he picks up his dribble, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1100.06s)]
*  it's like, okay, well, I can still maybe hit a turnaround, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1101.3s)]
*  I can still pass out of this, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1103.14s)]
*  I can see over the top everybody. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1104.74s)]
*  But that's kind of what you hope he's gonna do. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1106.58s)]
*  Like, all right, stop yourself, stop your own momentum, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1109.8600000000001s)]
*  and then be 10 feet away [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1112.6200000000001s)]
*  and then not really know what you're going to... [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1113.94s)]
*  And there's so many Palo turnarounds where I'm like, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1115.26s)]
*  oh, that's probably not the shot you want. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1117.5s)]
*  And then it goes in that it's hard to get on him too much. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1118.82s)]
*  But I can't even really even be critical of him [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1122.3s)]
*  despite the overall shooting numbers for tonight [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1124.5s)]
*  because it's like, well, he was the only one doing anything [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1126.18s)]
*  because he was the only one who was playing [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1130.14s)]
*  the most important chunks of this game. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1131.78s)]
*  Yeah, you needed the one irrational confidence. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1134.46s)]
*  They even needed like the Max Drews, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1137.42s)]
*  three threes and five minutes guy. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1139.6200000000001s)]
*  And they just couldn't... [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1142.14s)]
*  Anything. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1142.98s)]
*  That guy was not on their bench. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1143.8200000000002s)]
*  Let's, we're gonna take a break for the podcast [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1145.14s)]
*  and stay on YouTube and come back and talk about [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1147.7s)]
*  what does Orlando do. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1150.1000000000001s)]
*  All right, coming back. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1153.22s)]
*  See, that's how we do it, folks. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1154.46s)]
*  All right, so Orlando, big picture. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1157.26s)]
*  We're feeling great. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1160.1000000000001s)]
*  We're a young team. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1161.66s)]
*  We have cap space. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1162.8600000000001s)]
*  Like this is a positive year for us. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1164.66s)]
*  Don't get too shaken by that. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1166.66s)]
*  The negatives, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1168.42s)]
*  Bronz is just not with the offensive game he has now, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1172.0200000000002s)]
*  and he's been in the league now a couple of years. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1175.38s)]
*  I don't think you can comfortably say [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1177.98s)]
*  if we're a title team, he can be the second best guy. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1180.9s)]
*  Not positive, he could be the third best guy. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1185.5400000000002s)]
*  So to me, he's in like where Michael Porter Jr. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1188.98s)]
*  is on Denver, where you can't be the first [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1191.78s)]
*  or second best guy, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1195.3400000000001s)]
*  and maybe you can't even be the third best guy. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1196.38s)]
*  But if you're the fourth best guy, that's awesome. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1198.78s)]
*  And maybe that's who he is. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1201.46s)]
*  The only thing that would change that is if he shoots [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1203.3400000000001s)]
*  a million kajillion threes this summer, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1206.42s)]
*  and at least fixes that a little. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1209.46s)]
*  But this was all year. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1211.1000000000001s)]
*  He couldn't make a three all year. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1212.22s)]
*  I'm starting to wonder maybe that's who this is. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1214.54s)]
*  A really good slasher guy who teams are gonna leave open. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1216.8999999999999s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1223.4599999999998s)]
*  Because as we said in the beginning with his college stats, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1224.9399999999998s)]
*  like I went back and looked at some of the stuff. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1227.6999999999998s)]
*  I'm like, it's actually higher than you would think. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1228.9799999999998s)]
*  He was 35, he was 36, he was 28% from three this year. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1230.5s)]
*  But after the All-Star break, it just fell off. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1234.58s)]
*  He was just under 19%. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1236.6599999999999s)]
*  After, it's like 25 games. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1239.26s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1241.9s)]
*  And some of those were open. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1244.18s)]
*  I just can't fathom that that's who he's gonna be [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1246.06s)]
*  this whole time. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1247.98s)]
*  So the whole first, second, third, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1248.8200000000002s)]
*  clearly he's not a first. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1250.02s)]
*  They won 47 games this year. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1251.1000000000001s)]
*  So before we start predicting like, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1252.42s)]
*  hey, can they be in the short list of four or five teams [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1254.3s)]
*  that win a title that they're not there? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1256.3400000000001s)]
*  I still feel really good about what they've done [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1257.9s)]
*  and that they have somebody in Palo [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1259.8600000000001s)]
*  who has a chance to be one of those players. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1261.22s)]
*  So maybe in comparison to like some of these other teams, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1263.02s)]
*  you could argue they were even ahead of schedule. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1265.8200000000002s)]
*  If you were them, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1268.7s)]
*  I mean, Mitchell, now he just beat them, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1271.5800000000002s)]
*  but Mitchell could be one of the guys [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1275.3s)]
*  who's on the market this summer. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1276.7s)]
*  If he's like, I'm not extending, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1278.7s)]
*  he's got a year left on his deal. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1280.26s)]
*  And then teams will be lining up [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1281.78s)]
*  and everybody seems to think he wants to go to New York. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1283.98s)]
*  Miami's always looming, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1286.26s)]
*  but it does feel like Orlando is a possibility for them. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1287.54s)]
*  There's the Paul George free agent signing possibility. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1290.06s)]
*  And then there's the Hail Mary of Booker saying, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1294.26s)]
*  this son situation sucks, get me out of here, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1297.58s)]
*  which I think is unrealistic. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1299.74s)]
*  What kind of player would you want for them? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1302.46s)]
*  Who are you looking for? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1304.86s)]
*  Who's on your Christmas list for them? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1305.7s)]
*  It has to be, it's funny, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1312.1399999999999s)]
*  because I actually think like two warriors [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1314.3799999999999s)]
*  would fit the bill here. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1315.94s)]
*  Where you go, all right, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1317.34s)]
*  well could Chris Paul play 20 minutes [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1318.18s)]
*  and unclog some of these? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1320.5s)]
*  Because what I don't want them to do [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1321.7s)]
*  is I don't want them to bring in somebody so ball dominant [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1323.02s)]
*  than it takes away from some of the Palos possessions. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1326.3000000000002s)]
*  Like it's one of the hardest things [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1329.5s)]
*  with all these talented players would be like, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1331.0200000000002s)]
*  who overlaps and then who compliments with their skillset [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1332.46s)]
*  or really even their mindset [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1335.5800000000002s)]
*  of how they want to attack the game. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1336.9s)]
*  So I think they'd need some kind of guard [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1338.5s)]
*  that's a little bit more deferential that could still shoot. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1340.14s)]
*  But I don't know what people think of Chris Paul now [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1342.7800000000002s)]
*  at this point. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1345.3400000000001s)]
*  And I don't know if this team would be good enough [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1346.16s)]
*  for him to sign on for less money. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1347.66s)]
*  And that's why I still think Clay [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1349.7800000000002s)]
*  is going to make a lot of money somewhere. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1351.0200000000002s)]
*  And because on top of everything else, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1353.5s)]
*  he's a great teammate, he's a good dude. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1354.86s)]
*  And I think despite the Sacramento game [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1357.02s)]
*  in the play in elimination, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1359.58s)]
*  he salvaged himself somewhat this season [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1361.58s)]
*  from the lows of him, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1364.86s)]
*  almost having these open therapy sessions [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1367.6599999999999s)]
*  with the media after the game, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1369.5s)]
*  which is not surprising for somebody like him [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1370.5s)]
*  in his stature to go through everything he went through. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1372.1s)]
*  So I mean, we could sit here and say Paul George [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1373.6599999999999s)]
*  and maybe, I don't know what Brandon Ingram's availability [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1375.82s)]
*  is gonna be, but it has to be shooting. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1379.62s)]
*  Well, Brandon Ingram I don't think makes sense [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1381.4599999999998s)]
*  for this team. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1383.02s)]
*  No, not at all, but I'm just for names. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1383.86s)]
*  I mean, there are other names. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1385.82s)]
*  Cause I thought the same thing. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1386.8999999999999s)]
*  I was like, Oh, Ingram, Franz, is there something there? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1387.9799999999998s)]
*  And then it's like, well, why would New Orleans [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1390.78s)]
*  wanna turn Ingram into Franz? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1392.3s)]
*  Well, they might. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1394.3s)]
*  Really? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1396.58s)]
*  I think you're being a little hard. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1397.4199999999998s)]
*  Like if this is who you think Franz is gonna be, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1398.4199999999998s)]
*  then I can't win the argument. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1400.1999999999998s)]
*  I just don't think he has the same stock that Ingram has. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1401.5s)]
*  Oh yeah, so Rudy points out, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1406.74s)]
*  they have the ability to do the Van Bleek contract [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1408.3s)]
*  with somebody where it's like, whoa, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1410.9799999999998s)]
*  two for 80? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1413.34s)]
*  And we've been talking about Malik Monk to the magic [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1414.82s)]
*  for two months here. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1417.22s)]
*  And that's the kind of guy they needed in this series. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1418.98s)]
*  They, you know, are like a Tyler Hero, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1421.1s)]
*  who I think I realized during the Celtic series, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1423.1s)]
*  his destiny is probably he's like White Lou Williams, right? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1425.8999999999999s)]
*  He's like this awesome six man score guy, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1429.3s)]
*  but not somebody who's gonna be one of your three best guys, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1431.54s)]
*  but they need like a Monk, like a hero, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1434.52s)]
*  somebody who can come in, run the offense, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1436.6999999999998s)]
*  take some shots, be a heat check guy. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1438.6599999999999s)]
*  And those guys are out there. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1441.26s)]
*  There's a few of those in the league. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1442.58s)]
*  Feel like they could get one of those dudes. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1444.82s)]
*  It was the thing that roster was missing this year. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1446.34s)]
*  Paul George, I said this on Thursday's pod. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1448.5s)]
*  I went to the Wednesday Quipper Mavs game. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1450.62s)]
*  You were there too. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1452.6599999999999s)]
*  And they do the starting lineups and they were like, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1453.9399999999998s)]
*  it is 14th year, whatever, Paul George. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1456.1799999999998s)]
*  And I'm like, whoa, it's gonna be year 15 for him next year? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1460.1799999999998s)]
*  And he's got a metal rod in his leg and it's like, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1464.62s)]
*  here's 200 million, Paul George. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1467.52s)]
*  It's like, do you feel afraid about that? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1469.34s)]
*  Cause I'm not positive I do, especially if you're Orlando [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1471.5s)]
*  and you have some of the injury history they've had [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1474.26s)]
*  over the years with rich superstars that they've signed. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1476.78s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1481.5s)]
*  I don't know what the answer is, but maybe when Palos 21, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1482.34s)]
*  maybe it's not like a rush. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1485.74s)]
*  Maybe this is baby steps. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1488.78s)]
*  They don't have to make their version of the Mitchell trade [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1490.1s)]
*  or the Go Bear trade. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1492.22s)]
*  Take your time. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1493.12s)]
*  I was wondering if this has got bad. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1494.54s)]
*  And again, I think we probably ask a lot [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1496.9s)]
*  of these same questions, depending on how far Cleveland [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1498.06s)]
*  goes, but if you were New Orleans, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1499.98s)]
*  but see any Mitchell trade. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1503.5s)]
*  For Mitchell, I had it written down. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1505.58s)]
*  I think it's the most logical non big city team for him. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1507.58s)]
*  The next thing doesn't make any sense anymore. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1511.18s)]
*  And unless he just goes, hey, force me to Brooklyn, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1513.22s)]
*  and that's the only place I really wanna go. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1518.38s)]
*  And then he controls the transaction more than the teams do. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1520.22s)]
*  But I can't imagine it's a real long list of teams [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1523.3s)]
*  where you'd be like, yeah, I'll go see how it is [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1527.58s)]
*  in New Orleans and I'll sign an extension there. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1529.34s)]
*  I thought David Griffin was really revealing [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1531.54s)]
*  and interesting during that. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1534.34s)]
*  That was pretty rare. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1536.62s)]
*  Cause a lot of teams, I mean, the whole model is set up [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1537.78s)]
*  for all of these players that feel like failures [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1541.4199999999998s)]
*  and all these front offices to go, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1543.4599999999998s)]
*  like I guess we didn't really do it. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1544.62s)]
*  But part of what he was talking about where he was like, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1547.4599999999998s)]
*  hey, for a certain stretch, we had the best net rating. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1550.4199999999998s)]
*  And I was like, come on. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1552.74s)]
*  Like, you know, cause I think you can take these snapshots [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1553.9399999999998s)]
*  of seasons where you can talk yourself into your team [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1556.6599999999999s)]
*  being like at this level that it's not really at, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1559.28s)]
*  and this year's incredibly frustrating [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1561.12s)]
*  because of the way Zion goes out in that playing game [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1562.56s)]
*  against the Lakers. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1565.28s)]
*  But then for him to say, like, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1566.36s)]
*  I think we've seen this group enough that we can't come back. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1567.72s)]
*  And then you're like, oh, okay. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1571.3999999999999s)]
*  All right, well, let's- [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1573.2s)]
*  Cause we agree, we agree David Griffin. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1575.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1576.8799999999999s)]
*  I thought it was very honest and revealing [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1577.72s)]
*  once he kind of built to the point of saying the stuff [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1579.9199999999998s)]
*  that they did well and that he was proud of. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1582.84s)]
*  Cause I think there's a version of that Pelicans thing [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1584.44s)]
*  ends a little bit better if they had had Zion to close. I wouldn't have picked him against [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1586.52s)]
*  OKC even with healthy Zion, but that feels like the team, but it's never been a destination. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1590.28s)]
*  Nobody's ever gone, hey, I want to go there. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1595.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And especially you're signing up for a basketball situation because I assume Ingram [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1598.48s)]
*  would have to be in that trade and maybe even McCollum with Mitchell and picks. And now [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1603.2s)]
*  your future is tied to whether Zion decides whether he wants to be in shape or not. But [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1608.24s)]
*  the problem for Mitchell is he wants to be in New York and I just don't see how Brunson [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1613.52s)]
*  and Mitchell make sense. I've argued with Nick fan friends about we're already talking [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1618.04s)]
*  about Mitchell trades. Meanwhile, he had 89 points in a game six and a game seven. And [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1621.76s)]
*  you could have made jokes about his suitcases were packed at halftime. He's ready to go. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1626.88s)]
*  But he he really wanted to win that game. And I thought like even that the stuff they [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1630.6s)]
*  showed on the sidelines with him trying to get Garland going, like that was some of the [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1634.72s)]
*  best leader stuff I've seen from him in a game. Like he really took that game on, didn't [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1637.92s)]
*  want to the season end. So that made me think like, well, maybe maybe Cleveland is the best [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1643.44s)]
*  situation for him. He goes to Brooklyn. Who's he playing with? I mean, Bridges has to be [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1648.76s)]
*  in that trade. So now it's just, hey, it's Donovan Mitchell and a bunch of ninth men. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1652.96s)]
*  You know, he goes to the Knicks with what's happened with Brunson. I don't know if I mess [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1657.5600000000002s)]
*  with the Brunson thing. And like, here's another ball dominant guy. Like you just compared [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1662.4s)]
*  Mitchell in an unironic way to like there's a little Westbrook in him, which I didn't [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1666.54s)]
*  disagree with. I don't know how you put that with Brunson. So then you start thinking about [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1671.86s)]
*  Miami, start thinking about Lakers. What if LeBron's like draft Brawny? I want to come [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1676.42s)]
*  home. But New Orleans from a basketball sense might make the second most sense. I think [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1680.74s)]
*  Cleveland makes the most basketball sense for him. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1686.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's if you're I'm just not sure as much as I like both of them. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1689.5s)]
*  Whenever I was watching Atlanta this year, I'd be like, man, it just feels like Trey [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1694.54s)]
*  and Dejante don't really play basketball together. Like they stagger their minutes. And when they [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1699.46s)]
*  do play the game together, it feels just very taking turns ish. Like it doesn't really feel [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1703.74s)]
*  like they're ever playing ball together. And I think it's been a little bit better at times [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1710.26s)]
*  with Garland and Mitchell. But it kind of gets back to the original point of like what I would [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1713.3s)]
*  want Orlando to have. And that's somebody that's complimentary to Palo and not somebody [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1719.34s)]
*  that's overlapping. And it's just so hard. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1722.98s)]
*  Not just one. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1726.46s)]
*  No, but I mean, just like in Mitchell and Garland, you go, OK, cool. I have two guys who can [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1727.46s)]
*  shoot, two guys who can handle, two guys who can play make and two guys that can drive and get to [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1731.3s)]
*  the hoop, especially with Mitchell. That's that's his greatest skill of like, I really, really [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1734.9s)]
*  need to get to the hoop and some of these stretches. And we saw that so much in the last two [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1739.38s)]
*  games from him, which is just really special to be able to do that in the playoffs. And we've [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1743.14s)]
*  seen him do it before. But then I look at Brunson and I'm telling you, like, I love this [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1746.42s)]
*  next team. This is one of my favorite teams in years. But then I'm I'm honest with myself and go, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1750.8200000000002s)]
*  OK, but like, what do you actually think they're capable of? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1758.02s)]
*  Can you know that the cab that makes sense on that team is actually Jared Allen? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1762.26s)]
*  If you're going to like pick a cab that could make whatever everything that we like about this next [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1768.18s)]
*  team better. You take Jared Allen. I think Jared Allen works on a ton of different teams, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1772.5800000000002s)]
*  and I'm sure Cassie is losing it right now as they just won game seven. We're talking about [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1777.94s)]
*  potential trade. We traded nine times because we maybe we just the rules are we shouldn't be [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1781.46s)]
*  doing this. But I think it speaks more to the Brunson point and all the Mitchell rumors and [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1786.26s)]
*  like how important today was. But again, may have just delayed all of the stuff that we're doing. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1789.94s)]
*  Anyway, I don't want to mess with Brunson, but I also don't know if you can survive through, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1793.6200000000001s)]
*  say, three playoff rounds with that being your offense and him taking like 30 shots a game. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1799.8600000000001s)]
*  It's awesome. But can can you actually do that? I don't know. I don't I don't think the history [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1807.54s)]
*  doesn't tell you this works. Well, we're about to find out over the next two rounds. I had a [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1812.4199999999998s)]
*  thing written down. It's a borderline. I'd say I tell Kyle to turn the TikTok camera on, but we [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1818.26s)]
*  have the YouTube camera on. Who is Boston rooting for in that game? Probably Cleveland. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1822.6599999999999s)]
*  I think so, too, which is weird because they proved they were better than Orlando. But I think [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1830.1s)]
*  if the goal is like, don't put a lot of miles on us in round two, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1836.6599999999999s)]
*  don't just get in a weird basketball situation that's unconventional. Orlando is kind of a [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1843.6999999999998s)]
*  funky matchup for them. They have a lot of a lot of defenders to throw at different guys in the [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1850.02s)]
*  cells, kind of get in their heads to muck it up. I didn't want to muck it up series for them around [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1855.62s)]
*  to I want them to keep the flow they have in Cleveland. They'll have a better flow. Mitchell [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1860.1s)]
*  win one game, but Boston, they should have swept the series with them this year except for the Dean [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1863.62s)]
*  Wade game. Dean Wade came in, left his body. Hopefully. I don't know if he's coming back for [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1869.6999999999998s)]
*  round two. Maybe I'd be a little more nervous, but I felt the same way. I was like, I'm actually a [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1874.1799999999998s)]
*  little more nervous of Orlando in this next round than Cleveland. Does that sound insane though? [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1878.1799999999998s)]
*  You think people are listening to this going, that's nuts. Cleveland just won the series. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1884.82s)]
*  Mitchell is the best player on either team. Wait, you think Mitchell's better than, well, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1887.94s)]
*  better than anyone in this series, not better than better than Palo. Yeah. No, I'm talking about [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1894.26s)]
*  Mitchell versus Palo. Just double checking. That's what I thought. Yeah. Cause halfway through, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1898.8200000000002s)]
*  I was like, I think he meant this series. It's just the length. It's just the length defensive [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1902.18s)]
*  thing. I think sometimes defense with Boston, they can get into some bad habits offensively. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1907.06s)]
*  Right. And Orlando could muck that up. With that said, after watching Mosley play 10 guys and then [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1912.1s)]
*  put Jonathan Isaac on ice in the fourth quarter, now retroactively, I'm like, Oh, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1919.78s)]
*  I wish we got in Orlando. That would have been, I wish we'd gone against watching Frans go one for [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1923.54s)]
*  25 and it gave seven. Orlando probably would have been a better pick. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1930.26s)]
*  I don't think it's a definitive answer. Like Boston should, they should be able to, like if [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1934.26s)]
*  they're this good and as good as they looked through the four games against Miami, like that's [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1939.62s)]
*  that series ended up playing out the way that it should have with the one blip, historic three point [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1944.1s)]
*  shooting game where it's not like it went six tough games. And you're like, what the hell are [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1948.8999999999999s)]
*  they doing this again? Right. They killed them four times and then they lost the random game. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1954.02s)]
*  Right. They should still be dramatically better than either of the two teams that played today. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1959.62s)]
*  Some of the stuff Mitchell was doing in this game, I was trying to think of other guards that [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1963.38s)]
*  I've seen and the only other guy I could think of was Dwayne Wade, like late two thousands. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1969.6200000000001s)]
*  This, these guards that are not huge guys, but are super physical and have a way of going to [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1975.5400000000002s)]
*  the basket the same way, like somebody like Embiid would or Lebron would, but they're small [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1982.42s)]
*  in how they use their body and protect the ball and bounce off dudes and are [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1986.98s)]
*  just constantly guys are sprawling backwards. And you're like, was that an offensive foul? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1990.82s)]
*  What happened on that? And they'll show the replay. I was like, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1994.8999999999999s)]
*  I mean, it feels like he just muscled that guy backwards and then just gets this weird layup. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=1998.02s)]
*  I don't think I've seen a lot of guards in my life that have some of the moves that he has. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2002.6599999999999s)]
*  And it's weird. It comes and goes, because sometimes he seems super happy to just take [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2007.7s)]
*  25 footers and not play that way. And then other times when he plays that way, it's like, oh shit, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2011.54s)]
*  how do you stop this? I think you stop it with length, which is why I wanted them to put Isaac [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2017.14s)]
*  on him. But who else is like him to you? Darren Williams used to be just really good at [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2021.22s)]
*  creating all sides. He used to have this crossover that was nasty, but then he also would just go [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2028.9s)]
*  right at you, like get his shoulder into your chest. And he would create, now look, I think [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2035.8600000000001s)]
*  Mitchell's probably a little quicker than Darren Williams is, but peak Darren Williams, I mean, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2041.22s)]
*  probably argues even better than Mitchell. He was just so nasty and he was so physical, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2045.54s)]
*  even though you thought of him probably more as a prototypical, not prototypical, but what he just [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2050.9s)]
*  felt a little bit more point guard-ish than maybe Mitchell does. But my favorite thing for Mitchell [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2055.06s)]
*  was just, hey, you go through enough of these games, you've got a little bit of a playoff resume. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2060.1s)]
*  It's not amazing for Mitchell as far as the lack of distance that he's gone with other teams that [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2064.34s)]
*  he's been with. But just seeing like, hey, you know what's screwing us up on offense? This is [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2069.94s)]
*  when we wait around, when we let Orlando get settled again off the first thing that we're doing. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2073.94s)]
*  That was maybe part of the Boston answer where it's like when Boston gets a little clogged, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2079.2200000000003s)]
*  they can just kind of stand there. And then it's like, okay, but you're making it easier [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2083.62s)]
*  for the defense. And Mitchell, it felt like the light went off with him and was like, stop waiting, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2087.7000000000003s)]
*  stop waiting. It's like, as soon as you come off the screen, go. As soon as you have the ball, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2093.46s)]
*  go. As soon as somebody thinks they're coming up, make a decision there. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2097.46s)]
*  And some of these guys that are so good in the regular season, it almost takes them like a bit [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2101.78s)]
*  of a wake up call being like, oh, I guess I can't just like screw around and wait to do something [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2106.1000000000004s)]
*  offensively because they're right on top of me. Well, I thought that was Minnesota yesterday to [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2110.98s)]
*  some degree that they were playing with a pace. And I can't wait to talk about that series. But [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2115.54s)]
*  for the Celtics to win this series the way that they should, I think they're going to need Tatum [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2122.5800000000004s)]
*  and Brown to guard Mitchell. Cause he, you know, people haven't seen the Celtics that much, but [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2127.38s)]
*  like, oh, they'll just put white and drew on Mitchell. And it's actually not what they do [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2132.5s)]
*  sometimes. Sometimes they like to throw the forwards with link at the guard. And then they [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2135.54s)]
*  use the guards like to the guard, three point shooters and help off. And it would be interesting [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2140.34s)]
*  if Tatum was like, let me take Mitchell out this series. I don't think he would do it. Cause I think [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2146.7400000000002s)]
*  he'd want to match, you know, there's some ego stuff like, no, I want, I'll match him on our end, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2151.38s)]
*  but I like sometimes when, and they've done this a few times this season when Tatum's like, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2156.26s)]
*  let me take that guy out. We have enough offense. I'll be the one that guards them. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2162.34s)]
*  And Jaylen will do the same thing every once in a while. They have so many guys to throw at him that [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2166.26s)]
*  it's going to have to be somebody else. I think that that ships in with the Cavs. It can't be like [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2171.46s)]
*  tonight, you know, it's going to like Garland's going to have to show up or Mowby is going to [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2175.78s)]
*  have to start putting together the 2015 or streus is going to have to hit more threes streus, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2180.34s)]
*  a semi Boston killer. I'm not giving him total Boston killer status, but he had a couple of [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2187.3s)]
*  moments against them. I don't blame you forever being horrified by everybody that was involved [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2192.1800000000003s)]
*  with that team last year, but yeah, that's the advantage Boston should have with a team that [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2196.6600000000003s)]
*  feels like there's the one guy and let's Garland gets the shooting going again. And he just needs [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2201.78s)]
*  to be more aggressive shooting. I think he's good enough to be better than he was this past season [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2206.18s)]
*  or series, I should say. But if you're trying to just screen into Horford all the time, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2210.3399999999997s)]
*  like the two people are just going to stay with Mitchell constantly because if Alan isn't back, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2216.4199999999996s)]
*  like Alan provides maybe a little bit more spacing than Mowby does. And I know that doesn't [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2220.18s)]
*  necessarily sound right because Mowby is still supposedly going to shoot from the outside, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2225.7799999999997s)]
*  but you would just leave whoever the big guy is setting that screen. You're probably not going to [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2229.7799999999997s)]
*  close. You're going to say, go ahead, like make your first three shots and we're going to do it [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2234.98s)]
*  a fourth time and ignore you. Right. Feel free to make 16, 20 footers in this game. What do you [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2239.22s)]
*  think the line of the series is on Fandl? Celtics Cavs? Boston minus 500. Boston minus 1600. The [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2245.86s)]
*  Cavs are plus 820 underdogs. This is without Porzingis. Celtics in four is plus 185. Celtics [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2257.7799999999997s)]
*  in five is plus 175. Celtics in six is plus 470. The last time the Cavs won a playoff series was [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2265.46s)]
*  2018 game seven, the weekend of bricks, Rockets, Warriors and Cavs Celtics game sevens [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2274.58s)]
*  when they combined for 275 mysteries between the two teams, just to parade a barrage of bricks. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2283.62s)]
*  So now it's back Cleveland and Cleveland and Boston. We'll see how that goes. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2292.26s)]
*  Let's take one more break for the podcast and then we'll come back on YouTube and we'll talk about [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2296.82s)]
*  our guy, Anthony Edwards. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2303.94s)]
*  Did I hit everything? I did. All right. We're coming back. So Minnesota, Denver. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2305.78s)]
*  I was looking up. Where actually, where do you want to start with Minnesota, Denver? I'll let [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2318.6600000000003s)]
*  you lead because I know like that, that level of basketball yesterday was, and I saw you last night [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2324.1000000000004s)]
*  because we went to go see Shane Gillis, but we were both on a high after game one, Minnesota, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2329.62s)]
*  Denver, just about as good of a playoff basketball game one as you're going to get in a series. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2335.38s)]
*  Yeah. I almost said no to Gillis just because I was like, do I, can I emotionally pivot [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2342.66s)]
*  that quickly after, like I was kind of thinking about where I would be [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2347.8599999999997s)]
*  during the day and I was like, well, this, I cannot believe this is a second round series. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2352.74s)]
*  I can't believe we're this lucky. I think I would start with the defense kind of like what [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2356.5s)]
*  we talked about there a little bit in the beginning. And it's a lot of like more Phoenix's [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2362.02s)]
*  like, are you serious? Like Booker with Jayden McDaniels going like, are wait, like this is the [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2365.86s)]
*  whole game. This is what we're going to do. Like I'm not even at half court yet and I'm worried [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2371.46s)]
*  about getting it over. And you saw that with Murray and Murray had another slow start, although [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2375.7s)]
*  that wasn't the biggest problem when they were up 18 for, I'm like, okay, well Denver isn't going [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2381.06s)]
*  to get it run off the floor. And that wasn't the case. Ant, the cat stretch, the Nas stretch, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2384.1s)]
*  like there was a lot of really good things in there. I think the alarming thing, if you were [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2391.2999999999997s)]
*  Denver and you watched the film from it is you're like, man, they got good looks the whole time. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2395.22s)]
*  And Denver did not. No Denver worked really hard. Hey, my biggest fear for Denver in this series. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2401.22s)]
*  And I, but I'm rooting for Denver cause I, cause I just like Yoke Edge and I like Denver and I like [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2408.8199999999997s)]
*  when teams try to go back to back. But I'm also rooting for Minnesota cause I have a pretty large [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2414.02s)]
*  Celtics timber wolves finals bet at 16 to one. So I was kind of like back and forth, couldn't decide [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2419.78s)]
*  where I was going. But the thing that alarmed me for Denver was I was like, man, there's a recipe [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2425.62s)]
*  where they're just throwing these big guys at Yoke Edge and they're just making him work the whole [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2433.46s)]
*  game. And it's just two and a half hours of just not fun to be Yoke Edge in this game. There's that. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2437.14s)]
*  But then there's like the McDaniels Edwards, just them taking turns on Murray and just making his [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2442.98s)]
*  life miserable. And if those two things are happening simultaneously, what else is going [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2448.74s)]
*  on for Denver? And that entire game one was just, if Minnesota was going to play defense like this, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2453.86s)]
*  and then they're getting the ant piece on the other end and he's going to be able to rise to [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2459.86s)]
*  that level offensively, Denver can't beat them. The question is, can he do that again? Is that who [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2463.78s)]
*  he is or did he have a really good game? Because if he's there or close, Minnesota is going to win [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2469.46s)]
*  the series. I picked Minnesota. It was a coin toss for me because I didn't really like picking [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2474.1s)]
*  against Denver, especially him having the home court. And when the Go Bear Towns thing works, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2479.14s)]
*  it's Go Bear just swallowing up Gordon. And then he's left to roam off of Gordon because if Gordon [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2485.06s)]
*  tries to stretch the floor by sitting in the corners, the Go Bears is not going to pay attention [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2490.42s)]
*  to him. But then you have the Towns foul piece where, I mean, you had a tweet on this the other [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2493.94s)]
*  week and I don't know that it got enough credit. His foul habits are atrocious. He just decides to [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2500.66s)]
*  get these off of, he had two in like a minute when he came back in yesterday, we were like, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2508.5s)]
*  do you not want to play today? I actually was wondering if Mike Onori, who was in for Finch, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2513.14s)]
*  but I'm sure it's really Finch's call because he's sitting there right on the bench. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2518.1s)]
*  But when Nas was so good, I was like, do you actually go back to Towns? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2521.62s)]
*  We talked about this last night. They put Towns in with like two minutes left and it was like, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2526.5s)]
*  we kind of know we're going to win the game. Why do you think they did that? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2530.42s)]
*  Because they didn't want it to be a story after the game that Towns was benched for the last [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2533.94s)]
*  seven minutes. There's no other reason. Nas was the second best guy they had in the second half [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2537.54s)]
*  of that game. You're not taking him out. They had to take it out for, you could lose Towns potentially [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2542.74s)]
*  if you're just sitting him for the last seven, eight minutes. That was why they did it. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2548.1s)]
*  I think you're right. So if Towns gets in a foul trouble, then I'd think like, okay, so that means [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2552.2599999999998s)]
*  Rudy has to play Jokic straight up. And if you look at Jokic when he has just Rudy, he goes right out. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2559.14s)]
*  He doesn't really have that much fear of him at all. I wouldn't say it's as excited as he gets [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2565.38s)]
*  when Rui was on him in the first round where it was like, oh my God, oh my God, give me the ball, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2569.86s)]
*  give me the ball. I'm actually not going to pass here. He has no concern because I think he always [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2574.74s)]
*  thinks he can get, but the problem is if it's Towns and then Rudy helping off of Gordon, I mean 11 to [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2579.22s)]
*  25 and two from nine from three. I mean, Jokic took nine threes in that game because he'll also [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2585.7s)]
*  have moments where he's like, all right, I got to get going. I didn't start taking tougher shots here. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2589.8599999999997s)]
*  So I don't know that you're going to get that from Jokic again. But you left out that Nas's defense [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2593.4599999999996s)]
*  part because that was the other piece of this. Yeah. That's the point that we get it to is like, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2597.4599999999996s)]
*  when Towns gets in a foul trouble, you start thinking, oh, then it's Rudy straight up on him. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2600.58s)]
*  It's like, well, yeah, but they have this Nas piece against a Denver team that doesn't have [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2603.86s)]
*  another big, they feel good about playing. Well, and then the other way they were using Nas and I [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2608.5s)]
*  don't, I listen, this, if I ever get hit by a bus and they're like, what are the things you truly [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2613.46s)]
*  cared about? And list like 12 things. I really want one of them to be, if the other team isn't [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2618.82s)]
*  using their point card to bring up the ball, just pressure them 94 feet. Cause Minnesota went in this [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2624.34s)]
*  game and it's like, Jokic is going to bring the ball up. We're going to make them work. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2629.06s)]
*  Right. Like Nas was picking him up at the top of the three point line on the other, on the, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2632.58s)]
*  on their side of the court and just hounding and pushing them. And I thought they did something. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2637.38s)]
*  I watched a Tony Jokic. That was the first time I've seen a team speed him up where he, he was [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2642.74s)]
*  playing at a speed that I felt like was 10% faster than maybe he was happy about. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2652.02s)]
*  And they managed to do it and they got him where he just, I never felt like he was totally in [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2657.54s)]
*  control of the game. His stats were fine, but in terms of like the typical Yoke-age Meister thing, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2663.2999999999997s)]
*  now part of it, this is why game two is going to be so interesting. You're coming off a Lakers game [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2668.5s)]
*  where, you know, they, he, they had just figured out the Lakers and when they really needed a [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2672.74s)]
*  score on them and the who to attack and who to get into a switch and all that. And he had just [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2677.9399999999996s)]
*  figured it out. He controlled the pace. They never pressured him. So he's going to adjust [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2682.34s)]
*  cause he's a genius at basketball, but I'm going to, my big thing for game two is can they speed [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2686.6600000000003s)]
*  him up like that again? Have you ever seen him? I don't want to say he was frantic, but he just [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2691.86s)]
*  seemed like a little over caffeinated. That's not normally what he's like. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2697.86s)]
*  I thought there was stuff around the rim where he just wasn't, I expect everything to go in. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2701.86s)]
*  Okay. So like his touch, it's, it's like he's placing the ball up towards the rim. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2707.38s)]
*  The same way we're comparing them to the greatest players ever. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2712.82s)]
*  Right. So I'm not worried about him at all, but I would agree. There were certain things [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2714.74s)]
*  throughout the course of the day. We were like, Oh, that feels a little non-yoke-ish-y. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2720.5s)]
*  And Porter continues to have these stretches when the offense around him doesn't really have much [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2725.38s)]
*  going on. I mean, he had some stretches during LA where you're like, that was kind of the game. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2728.9s)]
*  Um, Murray, he was six of 14, his shooting numbers from three were fine. He was only two [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2733.14s)]
*  or four, but he was below 30% against the Lakers. So I don't know how much of the calf thing is [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2738.8199999999997s)]
*  there. Did you, what it, can I do my percentages on him? Yeah, I love it. 81, 74, 84. That seems [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2742.2599999999998s)]
*  high. It felt like 84% healthy to me, but they were clearly trying to put miles on him that whole [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2750.66s)]
*  game. They were like, let's this guy's watch McDaniel's let's go, let's go, let's go. McDaniel's [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2756.74s)]
*  had some early opportunities offensively where you're like, all right, that's a make or, you [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2761.7s)]
*  know, they're turning the ball over and I'm like, this, this score should be bigger. Like they [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2767.8599999999997s)]
*  should have a bigger lead than they have right now because still some of these looks are really good. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2772.02s)]
*  And then you have the ant thing that I can't believe we took this long to get to because [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2775.9399999999996s)]
*  it's so much fun. The shot making is absurd, but Pope provides zero resistance to him at all. Like [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2778.98s)]
*  it's not even close when he has pulled one on one. It's so much bigger than him. Yeah. It's, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2784.66s)]
*  there's like, I don't know how that's solved unless it's an effort thing, but Pope who we [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2790.26s)]
*  like defensively and you think, Hey, that's a nice little option to have out there. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2794.7400000000002s)]
*  No, he's a borderline elite defender. I would say. And he was just getting demolished. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2798.1800000000003s)]
*  Demolished. Do you know that? Did you read the back story on those guys? [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2803.38s)]
*  With the Georgia background? Yeah. And like, like Pope's known him for a while and it's like a big [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2809.6200000000003s)]
*  brother to ant and it's like, he's my big brother, but I'm going to destroy him. The serious like [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2814.82s)]
*  ant talks, the best shit of anyone I think we've had in a while. I want to get to some [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2819.62s)]
*  man stuff in a second, but what's big picture for this series. Denver was a minus two Oh five [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2825.38s)]
*  favorite heading into game one. Denver is now a plus one Oh eight favorite. We're still low. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2830.98s)]
*  Denver and seven was plus four 10 24 hours ago. Now it's plus three 50. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2837.7s)]
*  A Minnesota sweep is down to plus five 50. And the reason I bring this up, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2844.34s)]
*  I know you just made a face. I well, come on, you know, like, no, don't give me the, come on. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2849.06s)]
*  I'm just going to, I'm not saying it to you, but I just want to talk it out for a split second. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2853.38s)]
*  It's just so disrespectful to even ask this. Go ahead. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2857.3s)]
*  This is, this is why it's going to be good content. I was thinking, cause I'm going to do a whole thing [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2863.86s)]
*  about the history of aunt and some of the, the pool that he's swimming in right now, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2868.66s)]
*  this T wolves team, a little similar where this team has the look and I don't know if it's [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2873.62s)]
*  legitimate or not, but we've seen it a couple of times in the history of the league where it was [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2880.66s)]
*  like the bulls against the pistons in 91. You're like, man, they really kind of kicked their ass [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2884.58s)]
*  in game one. What did that mean? Ah, the pistons will come back and it's like, oh, they're down. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2891.06s)]
*  Oh two. Well, they're going back to Detroit. It'll be fine. Oh shit. Are they going to lose game three? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2895.06s)]
*  And then all of a sudden it's a sweep, right? Same thing with a pistons Lakers, which wasn't a sweep [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2901.14s)]
*  in Oh four where, you know, I think the Lakers won game one or game two. And then it went to [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2905.86s)]
*  Detroit and it's like, ah, the Lakers will steal game four. And it's like, oh, they're getting their [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2911.94s)]
*  asses kicked. Oh, this series over. Cause the Oh four pistons had the look. And the other one I [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2916.9s)]
*  was thinking was the 14 spurs when they split the series, the first two with Miami and it went back [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2921.46s)]
*  to Miami and then they killed them in game three and people are like, Oh Miami lock it down. They're [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2928.18s)]
*  going to win tonight. And I remember going on TV being like, I think there's a chance like San Antonio [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2934.42s)]
*  might've figured this out. And like the series, this, this like the Miami is in real trouble here [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2939.94s)]
*  and Miami remember they were down 20 points in every one of those games. This might just be, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2944.34s)]
*  this might just be a great spot for Minnesota is my point. There are historical examples of a team [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2948.9s)]
*  coming off like a long title run and just running into the wrong buzzsaw at the wrong time. That's [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2954.26s)]
*  a wrong matchup for them. And they're a little banged up. And I would be afraid of that if I [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2959.7000000000003s)]
*  was a Denver fan, I'm still picking Denver to win in seven, but to me, every possibility is on the [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2964.26s)]
*  board now. 2012 Thunder Lakers is one I thought of. Well, that's a good one. Yeah. Cause I was like, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2969.1400000000003s)]
*  wait, these guys are like, given it to them. They're not even remotely afraid of them at all. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2975.7799999999997s)]
*  Right. Like this isn't supposed to happen this soon. And that group ends up making it to the [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2981.14s)]
*  finals. They lost the first two to San Antonio, San Antonio, when I was like, okay, well, you know, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2984.74s)]
*  they're just not going to be ready enough to beat them. And then they won four straight where all [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2990.3399999999997s)]
*  the things I liked about San Antonio, the athleticism of, of the Thunderbird, just overwhelming [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2993.94s)]
*  as that series. That's a good, that's a really good example. Thank you for helping my theory. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=2998.9s)]
*  I just don't like it. I just, I just, it was the first game, you know, Minnesota hasn't lost a [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3003.94s)]
*  playoff game yet. So I would imagine the vibes are immaculate. That's another thing that ties into [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3008.9s)]
*  that theory. Like the bull, the 91 bulls, I think they lost two games and like one of them was in [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3012.98s)]
*  overtime. They, if, I mean, the bigger thing is if ants going to look like that, they're going to [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3018.82s)]
*  win the series. And I was trying, I went back, I did a little homework. I went back and I was like, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3025.78s)]
*  I went back, you know, he scored 36 in his first playoff game ever. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3032.42s)]
*  MJ scored 30 plus in his second playoff game ever. Kobe it wasn't until his 30th playoff game. He [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3037.86s)]
*  was younger, Wade 14th playoff game. Um, he scored 41 in his eighth playoff game ever, [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3042.9s)]
*  which is better than everyone, but MJ, his last three games, 39.7 points for a three game stretch. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3048.98s)]
*  She's 22 years old and you go back MJ, his three Boston games, he was 23, 43.7. Kobe, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3056.34s)]
*  when he had that 48 pointer against Sacramento, which is like one of the great YouTube games, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3066.7400000000002s)]
*  that's like, wait, if you're going to make the case for the 2001 Lakers is the best team of all time, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3070.82s)]
*  like the game for the Sacramento. And I was like, Oh, and Shaq was also on this team. Uh, but he [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3075.7000000000003s)]
*  had three in a row and he averaged 43 a game. And Wade was another one where he, you know, [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3080.26s)]
*  he had little stretches like that Jerry West, but like the stuff ants doing right now, historically [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3085.3s)]
*  it's a different level. It's not just, Oh my God, Oh, he, yeah, he looks like MJ. It's like [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3092.34s)]
*  he's doing stuff that the greatest two guards of all time were doing at this point of their careers [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3097.94s)]
*  when it seemed, it seemed early, but it wasn't. And that's what that to me, the ceiling is now [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3103.3s)]
*  even higher because of just what his last three games looked like the stuff he was doing yesterday [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3108.98s)]
*  to Caldwell Pope was like kind of post baseball MJ stuff and late 2000s, Kobe stuff and mid [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3113.62s)]
*  2000s Wade stuff, like some sort of combination of all of that where like the young athletes stuff, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3122.5s)]
*  but also like this wherewithal of how to back somebody down, shoot these beautiful turnarounds. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3127.8599999999997s)]
*  It's fucking crazy. Like for a 22 year old do that is fucking crazy. And if I'm Denver, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3133.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm terrified right now. Yeah, that might just be the part of like all of this where when I was [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3139.22s)]
*  trying to figure out, you know, and I changed my mind a bunch leading up to, to game one. And even [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3145.7s)]
*  though game one played out the way it does, I'm like sitting here like victory laughing, like, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3150.2599999999998s)]
*  all right, yep, I picked the timber wolves like, cause I knew it. But yeah, whenever I think about [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3153.54s)]
*  all the different things that could or couldn't happen in a series, like I can't get past the [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3157.62s)]
*  fact like maybe ant is just as special. I mean, we obviously love them. We've talked them up. It's [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3161.4599999999996s)]
*  usually not how this works. There was a number that Goldsberry had the other day players that [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3165.54s)]
*  have scored 35 plus in three straight playoff games at 22 or younger. It's Kareem, Kobe, LeBron, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3169.7s)]
*  and ant. Like, what if this is just the beginning and like, he gets one of these early, they get out [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3174.98s)]
*  of the West, like he might just be that good. And that might be the simple reason, you know, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3181.38s)]
*  instead of like, okay, well, it means that they had, you know, look, all these other parts of it [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3186.66s)]
*  are certainly important if they're going to knock off a team as good as Denver, but there's, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3190.18s)]
*  there's always like, I'll spend all this time looking at it. Like, hey, maybe just ant is that [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3195.46s)]
*  sick. Maybe he's just, it doesn't matter. Shout out to basketball reference. I looked up on [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3199.22s)]
*  stat head 23 and under 28 points or more 45% field goal or more and just who's on the list. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3204.66s)]
*  And it's like all the greatest players, you know, it's the rants 2012, which by the way, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3213.38s)]
*  was incredible that season, which you mentioned earlier. It's Kobe in 2001. It's Luke in 22. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3218.82s)]
*  It's Jerry West at 1962 Kareem's first year, Bob McAdoo. It just goes on and on. And ant has two [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3226.5800000000004s)]
*  because last year he did it too. He's just Michael Jordan, Oscar, like this is a different [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3234.98s)]
*  pool he's swimming in to use the pool analogy again. But, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3242.6600000000003s)]
*  and the shot looking this good this early, I mean, he was under 30% from three from college. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3245.78s)]
*  The team wasn't any good. So you couldn't, I had a hard time with it with him where I was like, is he [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3251.2200000000003s)]
*  taking bad shots, which is part of it. Like the team wasn't very good, but there was just a lot [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3259.62s)]
*  of bad decisions. He's really raw. He's a super athlete. He's got the ball a ton. And you're on [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3265.38s)]
*  like, all right, well, you know, is he going to turn to this? And then he just physically, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3271.22s)]
*  pretty quickly, you would watch him in the NBA. Like now he's next to NBA guys. You're like, [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3274.8199999999997s)]
*  that guy looks like the most impressive person out there of the 10 guys running around. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3278.8199999999997s)]
*  Just looks so athletically easy for him. Sometimes I play when he went full court lefty in the fourth [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3282.58s)]
*  quarter when it seemed like they wanted a foul, but they weren't sure. And ant just went 94 feet [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3288.58s)]
*  left-handed for a layup. And it just looked like he was a high school or an eighth grade basketball [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3293.3799999999997s)]
*  game. Like think about what he's shown now is that he can, he can drive at his size and get to the [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3298.18s)]
*  hoop. And then once he's at the rim against traffic, he figures out a way with like a little, nobody's [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3304.58s)]
*  Kyrie's finishing package, but there's certain things with him where you're like, is he closed [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3310.5s)]
*  off? Does he have an angle? Yeah, he has an angle. He brought it up and under on this one, or he [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3314.8999999999996s)]
*  finished left-hand on this one. I say, okay, so no one can really stay in front of them. If you stay [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3318.74s)]
*  even with him, he's probably going to be more physical than you. He's going to be quicker. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3323.54s)]
*  He's going to be stronger. And then he has all of these things that he can do. He can shoot threes. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3326.34s)]
*  His playmaking this year is incredible. And now if he wants to slow it down in a playoff game, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3332.34s)]
*  and he gets like the spacing he wants, like he had a play where Jokic was waiting for him in the paint [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3338.1000000000004s)]
*  and he may have had Reggie. It might not have been Pope on this one, but you could see the whole time [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3343.38s)]
*  he was trying to find a way to either bring Jokic further out to him for a pass, or if Jokic didn't [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3347.94s)]
*  come completely out to him, he was going to turn to his right shoulder and shoot it on the left [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3352.5s)]
*  side. And he was seeing it all happen and you could see the play. It was just slow, so it wasn't [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3356.82s)]
*  hard to figure out what he was doing, but he was waiting for the perfect positioning of where the [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3361.38s)]
*  defense was at. It was like, well, if Jokic stays where he is now, I don't have a passing lane, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3365.38s)]
*  so that means the shot's going to be on me. It's a little late in the shot clock. Let me turn and go [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3369.54s)]
*  this way. On top of that, then he plays awesome defense. So there's nothing about him where you're [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3372.66s)]
*  getting a 27, 28-year-old package for a guy who's 22 years old, and that's not supposed to happen. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3380.66s)]
*  I was looking back because I remembered his rookie year there was a game [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3389.8599999999997s)]
*  and you and I had both just randomly watched it and we were texting each other. It was like, [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3395.54s)]
*  did you see that? Because I went back and looked at his game log. He was bad for the first two [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3398.8999999999996s)]
*  months. That was the coming out of the COVID season, but his stats are bad. And then there's [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3403.22s)]
*  this game, I'm going to say it's like two thirds of the season against Phoenix. And it was the [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3408.82s)]
*  Suns team that went to the finals. And I think this was the game you and I texted about when he [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3413.3s)]
*  had 42. And it was just something there. And you look at his stats, he just gets better as that [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3418.42s)]
*  season goes along. And then the last eight games, he's like 27 a game and he's sitting threes. And [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3426.02s)]
*  just over the course of the year, he jumped. But I remember that Phoenix game being like, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3431.3s)]
*  there's something unusual about this. And he's since then hit every checkpoint. But then you [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3435.54s)]
*  look at this season, I feel like he's hit checkpoints during this season, even from like, [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3441.3s)]
*  Team USA, the first half of the season to what happened when Towns went out, when he had this [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3447.7s)]
*  extra burden and he was able to deliver to now what he's been doing in the playoffs. It feels like [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3453.38s)]
*  he's jumped four levels since Team USA. And those Team USA guys immediately were like, [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3458.82s)]
*  this is the best guy on our team. Like we were wondering if he's going to get minutes. And this [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3466.1800000000003s)]
*  is like, he's the leader of our team. The other thing I love about him, and it really reminds me [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3470.34s)]
*  of early LeBron, because I thought LeBron was like an unbelievable teammate on those early [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3474.5800000000004s)]
*  Cleveland teams, like the 07, 08, 09. He just was, he was so much fun to see in person. He was so [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3480.1800000000003s)]
*  happy. He was so inclusive. Like he was just awesome to watch. And Ant has that same [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3485.22s)]
*  quality, I think, where it's just, he's just the hub of all the activity and the energy. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3490.1s)]
*  And those guys fucking love him. Like they just are completely in on him. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3495.06s)]
*  Scottie Lundquist For a cat to be mic'd up. And at that one moment in the game, they re-aired the [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3498.58s)]
*  mic'd up stuff and cats going to him telling him to keep his composure. And for Ant not to just laugh [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3503.3799999999997s)]
*  hysterically in cat's face. I was like, I might vote him for MVP this year. But think about who [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3508.2599999999998s)]
*  we're talking to. Do you, all right, let me ask it this way, because I've already kind of alluded [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3514.66s)]
*  to it. Do you have moments where you're like, maybe he is this special that he's going to win [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3518.42s)]
*  this whole thing now? Yeah, I thought of it yesterday. I watched the second app with Tate [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3525.06s)]
*  and we talked about it and I was just like- Tate George? [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3532.66s)]
*  Tate George. Tate Frazier, the ringer's own. Sometimes it happens sooner than you're ready, [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3536.18s)]
*  sooner than you think. And that's one of the great things about all these guys. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3543.94s)]
*  Where we're surprised by the age, but that's really not a good reason to be surprised. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3547.86s)]
*  You know, like Tiger, it's like, Oh, Tiger, it's going to be so much fun to watch him. I'm [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3552.82s)]
*  not comparing with Tiger, but when Tiger came in, Oh, it'll be so cool if he can compete for a major [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3556.42s)]
*  and then he fucking won the Masters right away. You know, this is just how it goes. Sometimes [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3561.06s)]
*  guys just come in and they're fucking awesome. Like Gretzky came into the NHL is like, I'm going [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3567.7000000000003s)]
*  to take every record. I don't think he's Gretzky, but there are people that have come in. LeBron [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3572.02s)]
*  made the finals in 2007 with like a fucking G league team. You know, like it- Look, I still [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3577.86s)]
*  think that's one of LeBron's greatest accomplishments of his entire career. From 2011 and 12, that like, [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3584.2599999999998s)]
*  he took that team to the finals. He was slaying dragons every round. We were like, okay, I guess [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3589.62s)]
*  they're ready. So, you know, it's the history of this sport that sometimes guys are early [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3595.54s)]
*  instead of late. Wade, I felt like Wade in 05, I think it would have happened, but he got hurt. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3601.22s)]
*  Remember that? And then it did happen the next year, but I thought that 05, [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3607.2999999999997s)]
*  I thought he was ready to take the title that year and it was his second year in the league [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3611.62s)]
*  and it would have been crazy, but it was like, all right, I guess this is happening. So I think it's [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3615.62s)]
*  a good one. Wade's a good one because we usually don't get the early, but then I was thinking about [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3620.18s)]
*  and I'm like, okay, so he's not going to make first team all NBA if Embiid had been healthy, like [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3624.5s)]
*  Embiid, MVP, Embiid, you know, Embiid might have won another one. It's like, if Ant finished seventh, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3628.1s)]
*  like, I don't know where Ant's going to finish. He's not going to finish the top five MVP voting [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3638.02s)]
*  and yet I'll have moments. And it's not just because they won game one and I'm not going to [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3642.2599999999998s)]
*  be shocked if Denver comes back and Jokic figures some things out and they're terrific. And, you [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3646.1s)]
*  know, maybe they have to get a little creative with what they want to do with Ant. And then if [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3650.98s)]
*  Ant gets bottled up, then all of a sudden nobody else is making shots for two quarters straight [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3654.26s)]
*  for Minnesota. Like I'm not going to be shocked to see some of that kind of stuff happen, but it [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3658.26s)]
*  would be really just beyond unique of Ant arrives, Minnesota wins a championship. Like it's not [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3662.1000000000004s)]
*  supposed to happen this way. And then all the postseason stuff comes in and you go, he wasn't [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3669.3s)]
*  even top five in MVP. And then next year he's going to be the favorite. If those things were [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3673.3s)]
*  to happen. I don't know. Yeah. If Ant wins the title, first of all, if he beats Denver and makes [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3678.7400000000002s)]
*  the finals, he becomes the biggest under 30 star in the league. Like that's just like market down. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3683.62s)]
*  And he might be getting close. It may even be beating Denver might do that. He's, he's leaving [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3689.62s)]
*  Tatum, all those guys in the dust because he's just different. He's got a charisma to him that [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3694.58s)]
*  casual people, casual fans can see. Plus he delivers over and over again. Plus he's so fucking fun to [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3699.14s)]
*  watch. There's a world where they just win the title and he goes to team USA and you have like, [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3704.3399999999997s)]
*  oh, it's going to be LeBron and Steph and Katie's team. How are those guys going to deal with that? [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3710.74s)]
*  Cause this, I mean, now we're, I almost feel like I'm going to get hit by lightning, but the dream [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3716.18s)]
*  team was like that in 92, where it was like, oh, this is going to be the bird and magic. And this [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3720.8199999999997s)]
*  is going to be the, and then MJ just took it and it became the Michael Jordan dream team featuring [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3724.98s)]
*  Larry Bird and Magic Johnson and all these other guys. And it's going to be fascinating if he [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3730.8999999999996s)]
*  actually wins the title to watch how then that transpires to the dream team and LeBron being [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3736.5s)]
*  like, I always knew I knew from the get-go, this is going to happen, Fran. I've been telling him. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3741.38s)]
*  So here's the, here's the, like you didn't have him. Obviously we all agreed on where [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3748.42s)]
*  Jokic is. No one had him ahead of Luca. I don't think anybody had him. Well, cause he wasn't SGA [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3752.42s)]
*  SGA had the better year. He wasn't ahead of SGA this year, but in the playoffs, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3760.58s)]
*  he's averaging 33 a game and he's fucking demolishing teams. He demolished Phoenix. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3765.7s)]
*  Like he broke them, broke them. And that Denver game was the first time we've seen Denver. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3769.94s)]
*  That game was tied with seven minutes left and they got out executed and a team had a different [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3777.14s)]
*  energy. But you know, I've been watching hoops long enough that sometimes you can see when a [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3782.8199999999997s)]
*  team has the look. And I do think Minnesota has the look. I just don't know if Edward, [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3787.06s)]
*  it's going to depend on whether Edwards is ready or not to really just start slaying dragons now. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3792.18s)]
*  But he did it against Phoenix and he did it in game one against Denver. And if I'm Denver and [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3798.4199999999996s)]
*  I'm thinking, man, they have all this shit to throw Jokic, it's going to be really hard for him. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3802.8199999999997s)]
*  They have all this shit to throw at Murray. It's going to be really hard on him. Oh, [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3807.2999999999997s)]
*  and we don't really have anybody to stop Edwards. If he's feeling it, [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3810.98s)]
*  that becomes pretty hard series. They have a game seven in Denver. They have the pedigree. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3814.74s)]
*  We've never seen it in the situation where [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3820.5s)]
*  now this is really sitting there. Is he going to want it too bad? Like there's just levels to this [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3824.42s)]
*  that we've just haven't seen him in the situation yet, but it's, it checks a lot of boxes, man. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3829.06s)]
*  Yeah. And we haven't even mentioned the other side of it of like how good Dallas looks now and [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3837.86s)]
*  how great OKC looks in the first round too. So like, even if he gets through this, it's assuming [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3842.58s)]
*  a lot, but yeah, whatever. I think it's kind of fun. How funny would it like, let's say Minnesota [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3846.58s)]
*  beats Denver and OKC beats Dallas. And now we end up with Minnesota. OKC Edwards versus SGA, [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3851.06s)]
*  Jalen Williams guarding Edwards size against no size really at all. Ken Chet pull people away from [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3857.7s)]
*  the basket. That's actually a really great basketball series from a nerd standpoint. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3864.18s)]
*  And then you have these two guys who are the best, you know, other than Luca, the best under 30 guys, [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3868.58s)]
*  but you know, that it's sitting there now for Edwards and the defensive stuff they were doing [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3873.62s)]
*  in that game. Who else has been on that level in this century? Like the 08 Celtics got there. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3881.22s)]
*  I feel like the 04 Pistons team was awesome. All five guys could play any other position. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3891.14s)]
*  They were awesome. I think San Antonio has always been really good defensively. I think some of [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3897.22s)]
*  those switchy Golden State teams are really good. I was going to say the lineup of death, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3901.7s)]
*  I felt like could get there and really just get stops for four or five minutes in a row. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3905.06s)]
*  I just imagine if you're another really good player, whether it was Booker or Murray, [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3910.98s)]
*  they're just, and I know I've already said it, but you're going like, wait, what? [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3914.66s)]
*  Like this is, and just like, OK, could we just get a screen up here with a guard [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3919.06s)]
*  just so I can get angled to get the ball half court and get it set up? And it's like, now Ant's on me. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3922.66s)]
*  And now now Alexander Walker is on me. He steps up defensively and then you're like, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3927.22s)]
*  OK, finally got past these guys. Wait, what? Yeah, it's. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3934.1s)]
*  You know what go bare dated in that game yesterday that I've never seen in all the times? [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3940.66s)]
*  The two on one retreat thing on the Gordon pass from Jokic. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3944.5s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. Have you ever seen anyone do that to Jokic before? He was the first guy who guessed it. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3948.66s)]
*  It was like watching somebody pick off Tom Brady and like oh seven just like completely [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3956.34s)]
*  reading some pass play that had worked 100 straight times and some cornerbacks like I'm [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3962.58s)]
*  going to beat him and then grab it. I couldn't believe he did it. I was. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3967.1400000000003s)]
*  That was the most shocking moment of the game for me other than the 19 Edwards place. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3970.34s)]
*  It's so hard because. You're sitting there and you're going, all right, [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3976.1800000000003s)]
*  I want to come help on the best player in the world. Cat needs my help. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3980.98s)]
*  Yeah, I got to do it, but I've got to still pay attention to Gordon, so I'm sure it's been [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3986.7400000000002s)]
*  broken up a few times this year. I don't remember seeing that. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3990.82s)]
*  I don't think it's the only time I just I personally don't remember seeing it. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3994.1800000000003s)]
*  What would you do if you're Denver? What would you do with Edwards? [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=3998.42s)]
*  Because I don't think Caldwell Pope. I don't know if he's the guy. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4002.1800000000003s)]
*  If Edwards is feeling it, I think you need a different option. I think you start with Pope, [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4006.42s)]
*  but. It feels like that's got to be Gordon and one of the things I was crazy about yesterday was [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4010.42s)]
*  Edwards was making mincemeat out of those guys like he like borderline ankle breaking shit [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4016.1s)]
*  on multiple Denver dudes and just getting whatever shot he wanted. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4022.74s)]
*  But I think I think Gordon is probably the answer. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4025.94s)]
*  Then it stops, right? I might not use Gordon in the first quarter [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4028.9s)]
*  on him and hope that right. I'm saying late, right? Yeah. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4032.2599999999998s)]
*  I'm sure Malone would go to it if he feels like it's going to be this bad. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4035.62s)]
*  I do think there's a pride thing that we over always overlook [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4038.5s)]
*  and that if you're Pope and you're watching a film of this stuff, you're going, all right, like, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4042.3399999999997s)]
*  I have to step my effort up. You know, Peyton Watson will go out there and lose his mind, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4047.06s)]
*  but he's just not stout enough for Ant because Ant is quicker than everybody, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4053.2999999999997s)]
*  but he's also stronger than everybody on these perimeter plays. It's like, I'm not saying it's [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4057.3799999999997s)]
*  Lucas strength, but imagine like if Luca was also first step quicker than everybody. And it doesn't [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4064.58s)]
*  matter. Luca doesn't need to be quicker than he is now because it works all the time. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4070.66s)]
*  So I think there'll be some pride from Denver defensively. But even if you were saying, [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4074.02s)]
*  hey, you're just going to send more help or do all these different things. When he hit that [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4079.54s)]
*  crossover pull up to the right side, there's no scheming against that. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4082.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's a wrap. One thing Denver could do, I think, is when they're bringing the ball up, [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4086.98s)]
*  have Jokic running up near Chris Finch, throw the ball over his head and just have him crash [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4093.06s)]
*  into Chris Finch again. Maybe they just need to take out Chris Finch one more time. Who's [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4097.06s)]
*  the biggest guy they could send crashing into Chris Finch. I felt bad for that dude, man, [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4101.9400000000005s)]
*  sitting on the, uh, but he was there. I mean, he was, he, uh, he just can't get up. Like there had [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4106.34s)]
*  to have been three times when he wanted to yell at a ref, right? Uh, yeah, I imagine like a bullhorn [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4112.900000000001s)]
*  like, did you hear Barkley? Like he hadn't looked at the Denver roster really in depth. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4119.46s)]
*  Perhaps all year. Oh God. And then all of us, like if you, if you've never watched it before, [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4127.06s)]
*  you're going, wait a minute, Denver only has one big guy that they play. Like they're never going [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4131.46s)]
*  to play somebody else. And then they're like, wait, Deandre Jordan's on the team. Yeah. Dirk [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4135.3s)]
*  was calling for Deandre. I think at some point Barkley said Zeke Naji, he's like, he's six, nine. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4139.38s)]
*  He just, just looked at the heights on the roster and then goes like, all right, well, he's, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4147.54s)]
*  he's six, nine. He might be your Finch guy is what I'm saying. Oh, you Zeke Naji. Oh, I like it. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4152.58s)]
*  Well, here's the thing, Rossello. It's really hard to repeat. It's really hard to have everything [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4160.1s)]
*  go right for two straight seasons, regular season playoffs. And I go back to, it's, it's so funny [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4166.5s)]
*  that this is playing out this way now that going back to that Friday night, a game we watched, [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4174.9800000000005s)]
*  the Wemby game when he scored 17 points in three minutes, when Devontae Graham, who nobody knew [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4182.5s)]
*  was still in the league, made a couple of big shots in that last minute and it swung the seeds [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4188.02s)]
*  and Denver went from, they could have been the one seed. They could have played New Orleans with [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4193.06s)]
*  no Zion in round one. They'd be playing Dallas in round two, a team that I think they'd much [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4198.02s)]
*  rather see than this Minnesota team. And that one night might've shifted. And we said it on the [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4203.46s)]
*  podcast that Sunday. Like, wouldn't it be weird if it was one of those years where this random [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4207.78s)]
*  stupid game with these players that we'll never think of again from this season swung the playoffs, [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4213.3s)]
*  but it's in play. I definitely would have picked him in the opener. I would have picked him against [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4219.7s)]
*  Dallas and who knows? I mean, could OKC just have so much offense and with all their switchable wings [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4225.219999999999s)]
*  on defense, would they, would they not get manhandled? Would it be one of those weird [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4231.62s)]
*  bats like three out of the seven games, the Chet thing wasn't a problem or four out of the seven, [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4235.14s)]
*  it wasn't a problem. And you know, whatever game seven, anything could happen. But the [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4240.1s)]
*  fact that Denver, Minnesota, they're playing in a second round matchup. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4244.18s)]
*  This happens like what? Like three times to four times a decade where we just get this. Like it [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4249.46s)]
*  happened that one year with Golden State Houston, I think 2019 maybe when it was the two best teams [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4255.620000000001s)]
*  and that was second round. It was second round. Yeah. Sometimes it happens and it's weird. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4261.94s)]
*  I want to say OKC for Dallas for round two. We're going to end the, we're going to end the YouTube [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4266.74s)]
*  stream. We're going to end part one of the BS podcast. We're going to thank Kyle Creighton [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4271.46s)]
*  and Steve Cerrutti for producing. Unless Cerrutti, I don't, is Cerrutti YouTube capable for this or [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4276.58s)]
*  not? I forgot to bring him in and talk about Orlando. Is he? Oh, he is. All right. Well, [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4280.98s)]
*  before we go, we'll, we'll get some, oh, we can't bring Cerrutti in or we can't? [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4287.06s)]
*  Oh, all right. So let's kill time for a second. Were you worried about Cerrutti at all during game [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4294.9800000000005s)]
*  seven? No, I know he's not thrilled. I know he's not having a good time, but that's what I said at [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4301.46s)]
*  the beginning. If they'd won this series and lost the second round, the same, it's the same questions. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4308.5s)]
*  So it would have been more fun. You get to be a fan for a couple more weeks, but I don't, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4313.46s)]
*  I don't think the, how long the journey went told you a dramatically different version of what this [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4319.54s)]
*  team is with their limitations offensively. Like this is who they've been all year long. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4324.74s)]
*  Do we have Cerrutti? [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4330.1s)]
*  Oh, 30 more seconds. We have to kill more time, Rassila. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4335.94s)]
*  What did you think of Shane Gayless last night? [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4338.5s)]
*  I thought, I thought he had the same pace Minnesota's defense had. It's just, it's [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4345.62s)]
*  just marveling watching that dude work the room at a specific speed and not let up for, what was it, [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4351.62s)]
*  45 minutes. It was awesome. This is one of the best standup comics I've seen in person. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4358.18s)]
*  Yeah, I think he's the best right now. I'm not saying he's, he's the greatest. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4363.06s)]
*  Timber, Timber, Bill Burr and Chappelle are probably in the three of the final four. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4368.18s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I didn't, I didn't love the Trump and Tucker Carlson stuff, [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4372.5s)]
*  but I thought the rest of it was pretty funny. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4376.74s)]
*  Though. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4379.7s)]
*  Oh, we have Cerrutti in the frame. Okay. Frame him up. Let's see how this goes. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4389.54s)]
*  You guys framing it? Yeah. All right. Cerrutti, give it, you have two minutes. Tell us, [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4393.46s)]
*  walk us through your feelings. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4397.86s)]
*  It just sucks that we had to go up 18, you know, like it just, I was accepting of losing that game. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4400.26s)]
*  Anybody who asked me before the game, I was like, I don't know, we'll probably lose, man. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4407.139999999999s)]
*  This is one of those series where every home team is going to win. And then you go up 18, [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4409.94s)]
*  you get your hopes up. And then the end of the second quarter just sucked. Cause as soon as [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4413.46s)]
*  Kevin Clark and I were texting about it, cause we're like, cool, it was 18. Now it's 10. And [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4416.5s)]
*  they're going to go on like a six or run in the first quarter or the third quarter. And then it's [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4420.66s)]
*  going to be a ball game again. And I just, I don't have confidence in our offense. And that's exactly [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4424.1s)]
*  what happened. Well, I had a chance to hedge at halftime because I had an Orlando series bet. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4427.62s)]
*  I like plus one 60 for the series and they're up 10 and halftime. And it was the easiest hedge [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4434.18s)]
*  possible to just take Cleveland on the points. And I'm with you that the end of the first half [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4439.62s)]
*  looked a little dicey, but I still thought they were going to win. I don't know why I felt I was [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4444.74s)]
*  like, Oh, their defense and Garland looks like crap. And, and I should, I should have known [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4449.78s)]
*  he kind of shot your wad in that first 15 minutes. Yeah. I mean, the control that [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4455.62s)]
*  Apollo had in the first, you know, yeah. Quarter and a half was for a guy in his second year in [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4460.58s)]
*  his first game seven, his first playoff series of his life. That's stupid how good he is. And I don't [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4464.58s)]
*  want to hear about the efficiency. I don't want to hear about the shot selection. Rossella touched on [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4469.219999999999s)]
*  earlier. He has to do things that are so bad and dumb because he doesn't have, he had nothing else [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4472.5s)]
*  going for him. So yeah, when he takes those like, you know, 15 foot fade away jumpers that go in a [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4477.78s)]
*  decent amount of the time, you know, comparatively, you know, to other guys in the league, I'm not even [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4483.219999999999s)]
*  that mad at it. It just, the France question is going to be a weird question. I still have faith [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4487.219999999999s)]
*  in him. I don't know. Maybe he can't be a two. Maybe he can. He shot well every single year of [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4491.46s)]
*  his career. And this is the first year he hasn't shot well, he's improved up, but the thing is he's [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4496.42s)]
*  improved everywhere else. He's improved in his two point shots. He's improved rebounds, assists, [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4500.099999999999s)]
*  everything else except for the three point shooting. So are you, yeah. So are you going to [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4504.26s)]
*  say that he's just like incapable of being a player? I would say no. I think the overreaction [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4507.7s)]
*  this summer is going to be nuts, but he's going to have to play in the Olympics again. So he's not [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4512.42s)]
*  going to get a summer off. Lock him in the gym. Rossella, where does Mo Wagner rank on [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4515.14s)]
*  best? I just committed a hard foul and now I'm going to shit talk the guy a little bit, [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4521.14s)]
*  but he's not going to technical. Is anyone better in the league than him right now? [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4525.22s)]
*  Yeah. He's up there. When they had that jump ball, when everybody was freaking out, [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4528.66s)]
*  then he got, he felt left out. So then he just started crushing Laverte. Yeah. Like he had [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4535.3s)]
*  Laverte. It was the first time I'd ever seen a guy try to tell the other guy he couldn't be in the [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4541.38s)]
*  jump circle. Yeah. I was thinking he's like those guys in pickup, the sorry dude guys, who they elbow [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4545.38s)]
*  somebody in the head or they whatever, they push you for, oh, sorry, dude. He's a sorry dude guy [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4553.94s)]
*  just in the actual NBA. Yeah. He does something shitty and he says a huge smile on his face. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4559.219999999999s)]
*  He just has a punch. I love him, but he's like the guy who's like, Oh, my bad dude. Oh yeah. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4565.0599999999995s)]
*  I love him, but he's, I mean, I totally understand why he beat everyone. Right. And then after the [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4570.419999999999s)]
*  game, he's always like, so you, Oh no, you guys, you're an accounting, huh? You guys do it mostly [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4573.78s)]
*  like he wants to like be friendly with you after he just, just beat the shit out of you. And you're [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4578.9s)]
*  like, I don't, I don't want to talk to you for real now. Yeah. I have a torn labrum. Can you leave [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4582.82s)]
*  me alone? Yeah. Are there more Wagner brothers or is it just him? I think that's it. I don't know [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4586.9s)]
*  the world to handle more Wagner brothers, but yeah, I think two is probably enough. How did you feel [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4592.74s)]
*  about Jamal Mosley breaking down the 10 man rotation and bearing Jonathan Isaac? My only [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4596.34s)]
*  explanation would be, I don't have an explanation for the Isaac thing. My only explanation for the [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4601.7s)]
*  10 man rotation is he's just kind of grasping for straws, seeing if anybody can kind of step up here. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4604.9s)]
*  And I mean, I have an explanation. He made one shot per 20 minutes the last three games. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4610.26s)]
*  Okay. It's not great. That's fair. Yeah. Tough for the modern day. Bill Russell. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4616.18s)]
*  I get it. He shot it way better than I thought he was going to, especially in the playoffs. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4620.82s)]
*  Like sometimes he's the piece of big, Oh no, no, no. Yes. Guy from three. And if he could, [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4625.14s)]
*  you know, he was hitting from, from the corners, but he almost kind of had like a weird green light [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4629.38s)]
*  where I'm like, ah, you're kind of feeling yourself too much offensively here, my man. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4632.66s)]
*  But I feel like their roster problems are fixable. Like add a, like we need a max [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4635.94s)]
*  truce. That's what we need. I don't know who that guy is, but if we had max truce, [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4640.099999999999s)]
*  I would feel incredible going into a series like this. Judd Howard. Hey, didn't you forget [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4643.54s)]
*  in our camp, if I were getting jet Howard can Isaac said, no, no, yes. Guy. And he's also a, [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4648.82s)]
*  Oh no guy. But that's enough with other stuff. Um, can we have your summer wish list? [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4654.419999999999s)]
*  Let's hear it. Let's hear it once and for all. Give us gold medal, silver medal and bronze medal [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4660.660000000001s)]
*  for your summer wish list. What do you, what's gold medal? I mean, I texted you and kevs and said, [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4667.700000000001s)]
*  what, you know, how many, who do you say no for in the Booker slash Donovan Mitchell situation? [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4673.22s)]
*  Like, would you put France on that deal? I wouldn't put Suggs in a deal. Cause I just, [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4677.9400000000005s)]
*  I think, I think you're right. Something was off with him. I have no worries about Suggs [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4680.820000000001s)]
*  in a playoff series going forward at all. You wouldn't put Suggs in a Booker deal. Well, no, [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4683.620000000001s)]
*  I, if would you do frons and Suggs? Like is that in picks? Yeah. This is Rudy. What do you do? [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4688.02s)]
*  Are we, I guess I would, I don't know. I'd really not like to, I'd put frons in the deal. It's not [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4697.860000000001s)]
*  even realistic. So I hate how I'm talking about this and now everyone's going to get mad at me, [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4702.42s)]
*  but no, I mean, Booker would be great. It's not going to happen. I'm kind of talked myself out [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4705.14s)]
*  of the Paul George thing. I don't think it fits. It's like another kind of similar wing. I think [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4709.3s)]
*  throw the, throw the bag at Malik Monk. That's a great call. What's the deal with Donovan Mitchell? [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4713.54s)]
*  And otherwise I think it's just adding shooting. Like, can you just get guys like, could you just [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4718.42s)]
*  get add like two max truces, wherever those guys are. I think they'll be okay. And a point guard. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4722.1s)]
*  We need a point guard for sure. What's the maximum offer for Malik Monk for you? I don't think there [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4726.26s)]
*  is a maximum offer, whatever it takes to get it done. So you do like three for one 10 for Malik [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4732.900000000001s)]
*  Monk. You do it. Cause who else are you? You're not signing any other free agents, you know, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4738.02s)]
*  all you gotta do is pay your own guys. I think I agree with Saruti. Cause remember when Vane Vleet [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4742.02s)]
*  did it, Rossello when they did that deal and we were like, Jesus, but you know what? Like it's [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4745.780000000001s)]
*  good to have Fred Vane Vleet on your team. Like we do the ringer a hundred and he's like the 65th [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4750.660000000001s)]
*  best player in the league. It's like, all right, we had the money. He feels like a plug and play [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4755.06s)]
*  guy. He's exactly what they need. A secondary ballhander can knock down some shots. Doesn't [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4759.22s)]
*  have to, as, as you guys talked about, doesn't have to take shots away from Paulo. Like he's [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4763.3s)]
*  the perfect guy. Yeah. Yeah. The Houston lesson last summer for me was that I don't know if I'm [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4766.66s)]
*  going to get mad about any free agent contracts with all these teams that are bad, that have all [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfihPmBMG7Q&t=4772.66s)]
