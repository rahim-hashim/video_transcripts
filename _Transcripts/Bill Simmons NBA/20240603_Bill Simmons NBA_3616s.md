# Will the Mavs Pull Off the Massive Upset Against the Celtics? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-itaevpzaaY)
*  Celtics minus two 25 favorites to win the title Mavericks plus one 88 on Fando Rossello
*  Are people kind of sleeping on what a massive upset would be if Dallas actually won the championship here?
*  Because I feel like in the last couple days because Luca and Kyrie look so good in the last round
*  then now a lot of people like I'll tell you one best player in the series and
*  It just feels like Dallas is a massive underdog, but isn't a massive underdog. What do you see watching it from 40,000 feet away?
*  Okay, so you're frustrated about the series, correct?
*  I wouldn't say frustrated because I don't I don't know if there's 100% of a right answer
*  I do have some thoughts that i'm going to get into but I wanted to see what's your gut take on
*  um
*  How Dallas is being treated as we head into this?
*  Well, you started by saying it'd be a massive upset and I guess
*  I don't feel that way because of luca so maybe i'm guilty of all the things that you're being critical of right now because
*  I mean i'm gonna pick paulson seven and it's just not a hedge
*  It's respect for luca knowing that he will figure out a way to dissect. You know, he's penciled in for 30
*  Every one of these games. I mean if you hold them to 24, it's a miracle
*  But he can undo pretty much anything you throw at him
*  and
*  In a series where there's only five guys out there. I think he has all this momentum
*  That is preventing not only me
*  But others from thinking it would be this huge upset because it feels disrespectful of who luke has been
*  I completely agree
*  and yet i'm going to give you some historical stuff this is such a fascinating series to me because
*  the gut check
*  eye test
*  watching basketball and also seeing really what's happened with the mavericks the last three and a half months
*  And not knowing what's going to happen with poor zingas the series feels way closer, right?
*  Like even the celtics being minus 225
*  Feels a little high when you think about how well dallas is playing and the poor zingas x factor
*  But i'm going to give you some stuff
*  first
*  The mavericks would be the third biggest finals underdog upset
*  To win since the merger
*  Being plus 188 right now the biggest one ever. Do you know who it is? It's the it's the series that made her albop her albop
*  Uh
*  dallas
*  Miami 04 pistons five to one underdogs
*  In 2004 against the lakers and they win so that's by far the biggest underdog that's pulled off the second biggest one
*  was the 2019 raptors
*  Who were plus 230?
*  And that series was pretty goofy because kd comes back and immediately gets hurt clay gets hurt by the end of it
*  It's like the you know, the warriors running on fumes
*  But I I don't remember the raptors being uh underdogs like that, but apparently they were
*  So the mavs would be number three if they won at plus 185. This is since 1976 and then it goes
*  2016 calves plus 180
*  21 bucks plus 165
*  08 celtics were underdogs plus 160 against kobe and the lakers
*  uh, and then the
*  12 heat and the 11 mavs were both plus 155
*  So this would be the third just by gambling odds the third biggest upset since the merger that was surprising to me
*  Would you have guessed that?
*  No, I wouldn't have I mean the toronto number would have been different if katie was totally healthy
*  But there was all the speculation about what it was going to be considering they were looking for a three-peat at that point
*  I thought the dallas odds would have been lower the first time against
*  the heat and
*  I think that's interesting too the heat the heat second
*  Run through it
*  Well, that was okc
*  Yeah, guess what okc was okc was favored in that 2012 heat series. Yeah
*  The 06 heat were plus 130 underdogs
*  and the
*  1995 rockets were plus 130
*  And then the 1977 blazers were plus 140. So anyway, the point is
*  It's really rare for a team that is
*  This drastic with an underdog to win the finals. So there's that
*  next thing
*  Dallas would be the second worst finals winner by record
*  Since the first bird magic season
*  So the worst one since 1980 is the 95 rockets there were 47 and 35
*  Dallas is 50 and 32
*  Miami and 06 was 52 and 30 and then there's three teams in the late 70s
*  The sonics were 52 and 30 and 79 the 78 bullets were 44 and 38 and the blazers were 49 and 33
*  So just from a regular season. Hey, this is really unusual
*  This would be the second most unusual only one team has lost more games in the last
*  44 years and won the finals than this dallas thing
*  You remember that was irrelevant
*  Uh just before we go any further on that that's the regular season stuff for me on them is irrelevant. They were
*  26 and 23 after they had lost
*  I think six to eight
*  and
*  that was
*  The week of the trade deadline
*  So the first time they got those guys in the lineup together was and kairi remiss some time too kairi remiss like 20 games
*  There's there's a very easy explanation especially too when you think about 50 wins in the west this year
*  That's like 55 in a normal year. I'm just laying out. I'm just laying out history and stats. I I have no opinion
*  But it is interesting though the 95 rockets
*  They made the Drexler trade halfway through the season their team changed
*  This 24 Dallas team they make the gafford and the washington trade their team changes
*  and then uh the 06 miami that was
*  That had the coaching change right vangundy for pat reilly
*  At some point during the season and then once you get in the 70s that the 70s were pretty weird
*  Those those would be the three most drastic ones. So there's that
*  And then the other one that I thought was interesting dallas would be the fifth franchise
*  since the merger
*  To miss the playoffs and then win the finals the next year
*  And what's weird is that's only happened four four times and two of them were recent the 22 warriors
*  And the 20 lakers with the bubble and then the oh eight celtics they missed because the year before they tanked
*  And then the 77 blazers missed so that's it
*  so just like
*  Removing everything from it. There's three giant history red flags with the mavericks thing and yet I still feel like
*  Mentally i'm where you are like you almost like throw it out
*  It's this different maps theme that seems like it came together the last
*  Six weeks so ignore all the history stuff and concentrate on the six weeks. I think is the right answer
*  I don't think there's any other answer because
*  It's a different team
*  And considering the teams that they've gone through here
*  We're granted once kawaii went down the clippers are entirely different
*  But you take on an okay c team we're over the six games the points were even
*  and yeah a bounce here or bounce there although I feel like luca you have to give it a little bit more credit than just
*  Make or miss league stuff because we just see how great the looks are for him
*  How helpless you feel when he wants to make sure he's going to get a good look for himself?
*  Or if you completely sell out to stop him in some clutch moment in the game
*  He's going to make the right read and depends on whether or not the guy's going to hit the shot like you just are
*  Going to get a good possession like he and yokich are on the list of two
*  Where I go in a tight spot. Give me a good look
*  I know those two guys are going to be the best two looks in the world
*  And the fact that defensively there's some real connectivity with this team
*  That I watched the second game from from boston to dallas this morning
*  I watched it again and there's some stuff that you could say. Oh boy. That might be scary for dallas
*  But then I think about the defensive effort that I saw against minnesota and I go this isn't even close
*  It's not even close to being the same thing. They'd only
*  Yeah, they'd only been together less than three weeks
*  There's two other things from a history standpoint
*  The celtics I did that list for you last last week about the 20 losses or less finals teams
*  um
*  The there's only one team that had 20 losses or less heading in the finals that actually lost the finals and that was the 2016 warriors
*  Everybody else won 96 bulls 97 bulls 17 warriors 86 celtics 87 makers keep going going going
*  So this celtics team would have to be the second one ever
*  and there is
*  12
*  15 examples, so those teams are 14 and 1 in the finals. So there's that
*  and the other thing which I I think is getting lost just because of who they played but the celtics have
*  Been dominant for eight months
*  Right. They were 76 and 20 in the regular season
*  They were first in offense second in defense. They plus 11.7 net rating
*  The playoffs that were second in offense third in defense plus 10.8
*  They've been pretty consistent
*  and
*  I don't know. I feel like
*  From an odd standpoint the odds should be higher and yet I understand why the yards are what they are because the luke of fear
*  Factor and because this is the kind of league we've grown up with where it's like
*  You take the one guy who's not afraid of a situation is the best guy in the court and that should overcome all this other stuff
*  And yet all the historical evidence says yeah most of the time that's not actually true
*  Most of the time that team loses and here are all the examples
*  I think this is one of the harder series to figure out that we've had because the other thing we did mention
*  Home court advantage just does not seem to matter anymore
*  I don't think it matters where these games are being played. I don't know if it really helps boston
*  Other than maybe to have a game seven in boston
*  But for the most part I don't really feel like it's going to matter the times are so late on the east coast that part's weird
*  Boston's been great on the road all season. I think they could go into dallas and win
*  I just don't think it matters. I think this is a really goofy series
*  So two things in all the different ways that i've looked at the series
*  If you go over the last
*  However, many years you say okay lebron
*  When he won it in the bubble
*  He's still in the conversation for best part in the league. Is that fair four years ago? Yeah, no question. Okay. All right, so 21
*  yannis
*  22
*  stef little reminder season
*  23 yokich
*  Maintains his hold on the belt where you could have argued it or he'd had it for a little while
*  And then the kind of dot dot dot part of it here with luca where we just know if you're a boston fan tatum's none of those guys
*  So he's none of those guys and I think this is a three-year boston hangover where you could even add years if you wanted to
*  And this is something i've talked about the past where if ever I do like a radio interview somewhere and they'll
*  We'll say yo, what's what's up with boston what's up with bosses like they had a schedule in 1718
*  Okay
*  And when they lost to miami in 20, I didn't really think it was that big of a deal
*  22 they showed something against milwaukee
*  That would be counter to the fact that people still think they're soft
*  And i'll admit there's moments where it's not so much soft
*  It's just the late execution which we're going to spend a lot of time talking about with the series because it'll probably creep up
*  And scare you if it happens in game one where boston just stagnant offensively lose at home
*  And luke is closing. Well, you're gonna go up here. We go again
*  But I think it's a three-year hangover of not trusting the offense against golden state
*  And it's looking very apparent that there was a gap
*  And then the miami debacle of last year
*  So if this celtic season where they just added drew in prisingus and this group hadn't really gotten through the second round
*  And they're in this tier with all these other nba teams and their rosters going what's wrong with this guy? What's going on?
*  It's it's different in that if it lived on its own
*  I think the celtics would be more public favorites at least the way they'd be talked about
*  But it feels like the basketball community is just so sick of them
*  Yeah, probably too disappointed by them that all that's baked in to the lead-up of this where again the boston run just wasn't that impressive
*  And luca took out three teams with 50 wins
*  And yet the boston, you know, they didn't have prisingus this whole time which just got kicked to the curb
*  With the run, I know they're a bunch of stars missing on another team
*  But I I do feel like it was a bigger deal to not have prisingus than people gave it credit for it was 23 a game
*  It was the guy who just made them completely unstoppable offensively. It had a ripple effect on their bench
*  There's guys either playing more there are some games where they just got zero from the bench because the the whole hierarchy got
*  Got knocked around if he plays and he's healthy, which I still haven't been able to get a straight answer on
*  They're gonna have five of the best seven guys in the series
*  um
*  I guess one of the things that i'm really surprised by
*  is
*  And I get it because luca's super fun to watch and kairi has been the best version of kairi we've seen in
*  I don't know since the 2017 finals
*  and
*  has
*  Shown a lot of different things over three rounds. I thought in okc
*  When they were guarding him a specific way and he wasn't trying to force anything
*  He was just playing defense getting people involved and then this last round where he was really good
*  um
*  So it feels like people are glass half full on those guys in a lot of ways
*  And then on the boston guys glass half empty
*  Like luca is better than tatum. There's no question
*  But tatum's not like that far away from luca from a statistical standpoint
*  It's not like the distance it was with minnesota where if ant ant's not going to play that well
*  That it was like a chasm right ant not playing well
*  It was like 22 to 24 points a game tatum and brown and the playoffs have been like 51 52 points a game
*  Which is right around the same of where luca and kairi are, you know, but I I just think from my test
*  It seems like those guys are so much
*  So much more fun to watch play offense. It doesn't make sense to us that the stats are
*  Pretty similar and they are but it's built
*  I think it's because it builds in that luca and kairi were at 59 points per game combined against minnesota the best defense in the mba
*  and
*  If you were just to look at this if they if dallas hadn't played
*  minnesota
*  Along their path to the nba finals
*  You go boston's got all these different guys. It can switch it to a ton of stuff
*  They've got some guys they can start with jaylen brown on him
*  It was big enough tatum has to get him for some spots as long as drew doesn't get
*  Pinned deep in the post, you know, he can at least hold up a little bit like there's options, right?
*  There's options. I think he's gonna walk derrick white down when he gets him
*  And then you're like, okay, but
*  The other team had ant they had jayden
*  They had alexander walker and then they'd be filtered into these other big guys back there
*  And it didn't matter like it went to another level
*  And that's the boston side that scares you
*  So on the minnesota piece because I think that's part of what we need to do to unpack this dallas boston matchup
*  The big question for me is what happened in minnesota? So the minnesota piece of this we haven't talked about that series since it ended
*  and
*  I can't I can't decide what happened because you could tell me there was some rock paper scissors stuff going on with denver
*  Minnesota and dallas, right?
*  minnesota
*  built to be
*  denver
*  Dallas for whatever reason matched up perfectly against minnesota
*  And maybe if denver played dallas, maybe that would have been a great matchup for them. I don't know but watching it
*  And I was just like man
*  I I couldn't tell whether it was like strategy mistakes that they were doing or what it was because in the previous round
*  Okc put jaylen williams a lot on kairi and then they followed that up with walis and they really
*  I don't say they took kairi out of the series, but they really gave him issues
*  I mean he averaged like 16 points a game in that series
*  and then minnesota
*  It seems like they couldn't decide what the right kairi strategy was and all of them turned out to be the wrong strategy, right?
*  So defensively it was like they just never figured it out and then luca just gained confidence as the series went along
*  It just torched them and then on the other side they couldn't figure out who to attack and exploit on the dallas
*  On the dallas side and every time they tried to attack luca it got weird
*  It's like well go to go when he's gone go bear will
*  We'll post up go bear and it's like all right if you're gonna start doing that you're probably in trouble
*  But it was like they could just never solve it. So did minnesota run out of gas
*  Or did dallas go up a level or both?
*  I don't think it's running out of gas. I mean this team's too young to sit there and say they ran out of gas even though ant was
*  like ufc fifth round exhausted at the end of game one
*  And yes, I think he he might have just been so hyped
*  He might have just been so hyped and he was bringing the ball up to help conley
*  He's guarding kairi. He's chasing around and then he's tasked with being the number one option the entire line on offense, but
*  It was
*  So when people are gonna say like oh, what do you mean? They didn't run out of gas like look at him
*  Look how tired the guys were
*  I think that was a specific game thing for an he might have just been so hyped up that he he burned himself out
*  a little bit so
*  The thing I keep coming back to when I try to figure out who I was going to pick
*  Is that it's two versus one?
*  All right, and two versus one meaning
*  Minnesota had one guy they cared about on offense and if you go back through all those cat games
*  Before he finally got hot in game four and he sucked again in game five
*  Those are a lot of good looks the worst shot decisions cat made was when he decided to drive on lively
*  And I don't know that he got lively one time by the way, maybe he got some pre-throws in game five
*  But it only worked once lively was out of the game in game four
*  And when I look at Oklahoma City
*  Shay has that incredible game four where he goes 10 of 14 for mid-range shots for the most makes of the mid-range in
*  Five years since chris paul in a playoff game, you know, like that's how you had to win that game
*  Yeah, you had to do that and then you're watching jaylen williams have these long stretches where as a young guy first taste of it
*  Didn't really look comfortable offensively and then if you look at the clippers part of it
*  You get the coin toss stars the coin toss brothers in hardened and pg
*  Is that you just come up with that? Yeah. Yeah, you just like you have no idea
*  not
*  You have no idea. There's two options one's good one's bad, but you know within the first six minutes of the game
*  It's like oh we're hard on tails right with hardened. I can usually tell be like, uh, oh we're doing a lot of entry passes
*  uh
*  so
*  when I
*  Land on boston in seven games. I do believe this will be the first time where it goes wait. We have to defend
*  We have to worry about more than one guy
*  right
*  That's they only really had in one quipper game when it was paul george and hardened were going together
*  Because I think that only happened once in that series certainly. Okay, see never happened. What's the floater game?
*  I mean hard hits all those floaters. Yeah at the end of that one game where
*  Dallas stayed back the entire time and was just letting but you're also expecting like is hardened going to make every single one of
*  These floaters and he does because he's obviously really talented
*  But from all the angles that I look at this
*  the one that makes me feel best about the boston side of it is
*  This is the first time in a couple series where that number two guy
*  Is going to feel like a better bet to show up than what you had with okc and certainly minnesota
*  Well, what if they get a healthy porzingis is the other piece too because then they'll have a third guy who is better
*  Like I still think there's a scenario where he comes in and he's just
*  Really good and they've been kind of putting them on ice and keeping
*  You know keeping the entry glow on it, but it's fine
*  I don't know
*  Um back to minnesota for one second
*  Towns was eight for 33 from three in the series
*  That was higher than I thought
*  And all of those shots felt like they were open
*  I don't really feel like anyone more contested. He finished with eight threes and 12 fouls
*  Uh, I went through them all bill
*  I went through every one of his shot attempts through the first three games and I went in expecting way more decisions that I didn't like
*  And it was one of those deals where when you're only
*  Like really focused on that I got done like I have really easy thing
*  I'll go like good decision bad decision and then kind of questionable maybe not on him shot clock or whatever
*  There was an overwhelming number of them that were actually really good looks and the best shooting the self-anointed best shooting big in the nba
*  Didn't make them you just get and then you go the previous series when their whole strategy was like
*  Let's at least try to take out as much of kairi as we can
*  We'll let all these other guys beat us, which I think is the right strategy when you play dallas
*  And then pj goes 23 for 49 from three
*  Jones goes 10 for 27. So combined they were 33 for 76
*  and then
*  Josh green was 10 for 27. So other guys just started making it. I guess like if you're gonna make the case against dallas
*  their role guys, I think
*  I'll kick their coverage a little bit from a shooting standpoint
*  And we know at the finals we know that there's levels to this stuff as you go and you get to that final round
*  And the intensity and the scrutiny and everything starts three hours for the game
*  And even when you're doing shoot arounds, there's a bunch of people on the court already
*  Games start late. There's no flow to anything
*  And it's tough to rely on those guys
*  You know, it just is whereas at least the celtics
*  Their guys went through it in 2022 with the exception of drew who went through it in 21 on the bucks
*  So really everybody they have out of their key six guys
*  Has been through all the beats of a four-round playoff series except for poor zingas
*  That's it. So I think that's an advantage for them. Um
*  the flip side is
*  If you're luca
*  Who did you go against in the first three rounds that is the type of person who can at least make you work for all
*  The points you need to get
*  Dork
*  Okay
*  Um
*  It makes you work
*  Jaylen and tatum are at least going to make them work and I think that's one of the things that interests me about this series
*  From like just a basketball strategy standpoint
*  How much are they going to try to put on those two guys because those are the type of guys
*  I talked about this last week called ben simmons was like probably the most successful guy against luca over the last six years
*  He knows a younger version of luca, but it's six nine athletic
*  Strong
*  That's who you want at least like make them work. So he can't like put people on this hip pocket and do all the stuff he does
*  One of my questions I have is who is jaylen going to guard in this series?
*  Because I think you can make a case. He should guard kairi
*  Okay, so i'm going to go with kairi
*  Because that's what okc did where they put jaylen williams on him a lot and they put size and athleticism and length on him and just tried to
*  Make him pass the ball around and we've seen jaylen take all these other challenges. It feels like a very jayleny
*  Decision be like you're gonna guard kairi and get one. Yeah, fuck. Yeah, i've got all these different guys
*  People don't realize what a good two-way like I can see him getting fired up for it
*  And then just trying to take out kairi and then just throwing a bunch of people at luca
*  It'll be drew
*  You know little al horford like that like whatever they'll just
*  Kind of rotate dudes, but really try to take out kairi would be my guess
*  Jaylen aside to kairi and kairi goes for 45 in game one and jaylen says in the post game. He's just he's just proud of him
*  I hope I hope those guys are going to do that this road
*  So when I looked at the matchups i'll give them to you from march first game dallas started lively
*  PJ josh green started and then it was kairi and luca
*  and
*  You know me I just I seem to always love josh green minutes even when they're a little chaotic
*  Yeah, and jaylen starts on luca but
*  It doesn't really matter like you can be assigned to them
*  Immediately within that game a lot of the stuff that's the same stuff that we saw against minnesota those double drag screens
*  Luca works at left to right. He's looking for like two different things off it than throws to the corners
*  But I thought the most interesting part was that prisingas is on pj washington
*  And tatum was on lively, so I don't know if lively now who is really
*  Answered the bell about like if if the crazy thing about lively if he's only this
*  It's awesome
*  Right. It's like a 15 year career
*  Yeah
*  So I think there's probably a little bit more trust depending on how luca's going to be looking for switches
*  Because you know as soon as there was a double big lineup with horford and prisingas
*  He was looking for horford's guy to come up and set the screen
*  But prisingas with all of his rim protection numbers where he was the fifth best
*  Depending on how many attempts at the rim in the nba this season like really lofty numbers like up there with mb up there with
*  um kessler up there with uh, who else rudy I think was fourth and that number when you look at
*  Where prisingas is statistically and how much you think that should help boston?
*  Having some kind of rim protection there
*  I don't know if missoula will do the same thing where it's like keep him on pj but allowed to roam
*  But if you get okc pj
*  Then you're in major trouble where then against minnesota. It didn't even matter that he only shot 25% from three. So
*  When I watched the game again this morning, you know drew has to make sure he doesn't get stuck deep where luca's setting up off the ball
*  Because that's a problem. I think white just isn't stout enough for him
*  It probably feels like jalen and tatum, but then it'll really be dictated on what kind of switch
*  What kind of switch luca wants to run because I think he'd probably be more trusting and lively at this stage than he was
*  When they played in march
*  Well, they're gonna trap him a bunch too. That was one of the many weird minnesota pieces. I didn't get from that last series
*  Is that they think so they don't double I thought it was an easy series for dallas
*  They just kind of did whatever they wanted to do. Whereas I thought okc
*  Was a little more inventive with the way they defended and it just came down to the
*  The side guys on dallas just made a shitload of shots and they got some rebounds
*  But I felt like okc was way more in the ballpark for how to play with that team
*  And the quipper series was weird because luca was hurt because I was looking at some of those games trying to remember what I thought
*  and luca shot like
*  I don't know 24% from three or like he just was
*  limping around for most of the time
*  Um
*  But I think the okc was a better basically boston has to do what okc a lot of what they did in that last series
*  But rebound and protect the rim a little bit better. Um
*  One of them you're right about luca. I I just want to add this though
*  To think that through the grind luca has looked better and better physically as the playoffs have gone on
*  Because there were the clippers moments were like, okay, wait, what's going on here?
*  He shot 24 from three in that series
*  Even in the clinching game. He was one of ten. He starts game one against okc one for eight and then
*  Against them in game two
*  I was actually like worried about him as we've already covered that part of it didn't take a lot of free throws in that game
*  At all, but still finishes with 29 10 and 7 which basically like the the least you'd expect from him
*  But he still had moments where physically it didn't look right
*  I don't know if it was him working the officials maybe a little bit more because of doris physicality
*  But then you go into the minnesota part of it like you're saying oh they could have done this they could have done that
*  I just think that's the brilliance of him. I mean it's 44 from three. It's 43 from three in that game
*  In that series because you think he got jaden
*  This is the stout versus length thing with luca that that I think is very easy to identify
*  As great as jaden is on the ball and he's one of the best in the game
*  He got on the back side of luca. Yeah, every single high screen
*  And then luca is like, okay, you're behind me going for a ride. I'm not worried about you
*  I've got a retreating big for the most part minnesota wants to drop there
*  I think sometimes they change it up a little bit, but consistently it was him knowing
*  He's got lively on some kind of role and then his vision to the corners is unmatched because he's as massive as he is
*  And he can just stop and then make the decision and you're battling four different decisions
*  So I think it looks easy not because minnesota screwed up because of how special he is
*  I think they screwed up not putting mcdaniels on kairi and just being like mcdaniels take out kairi as much as you can
*  So would you would you focus on i think if they had to do it over again is unquestionably what they would have done is that
*  Because I think you bring up a good point in thinking about this
*  Do you think it might be like hey if luca wants to switch and get in one on one's fine, but
*  boston needs to make sure kairi is bottled up as much as possible off the ball that's what I think
*  I think they're gonna trap luca so that they he doesn't get going
*  Because like in the first quarter of the minnesota game was a great example
*  You could see what was unfolding as it was unfolding and everyone could see it except minnesota who was like, oh man
*  I hope it doesn't make another shot and then you make another shot. I was like, oh
*  Damn, he made another one. It's like you guys can control this a little bit
*  Let somebody else make a shot. I don't I think boston is going to do everything they can to not let those luca runs
*  Happen and they have the perfect team to guard kairi
*  They really do they even have a better version of what okc had to at least
*  You know, you're not gonna
*  Shut them down, but they have guards to throw to them. They have size to throw to them
*  They have rim protection if poor zingas is going to play
*  And you know, I just think it's a good matchup. It's funny though
*  Because I heard some some great stuff over the last couple days. There was some some rollicking takes out there
*  Yeah, it doesn't seem like you mean great in the sense that most of us just give it give us a pill
*  What do you got get it off takes for flying?
*  um
*  Jalen's really good. I I just want to start there
*  I think there is a chasm between the people who talked about the celtics versus the people who actually watched them like
*  Jalen in the playoffs for three rounds now
*  He's 25 points a game. He's shooting 54 percent and he should 37 percent from three
*  And he's plus six point eight when he plays
*  Kyrie's averaging 23 a game and shooting 49 percent
*  And I think if you ask the normal person be like who's a better offensive player that like Kyrie a hundred times out of 100
*  He's way better than Jalen
*  It's like is he Jalen's for the last four years of the playoffs is averaging more points than he is and
*  And he's a better shooter than Kyrie is at least from field goal percentage
*  It's at least like arguable that he could put up similar production. It's Kyrie
*  But I think we've hit this point based off that last series where people are like luca and Kyrie man. It's unstoppable
*  There's no two like this in the league
*  And tatum and brown have been pretty good for a long period of time. They just went 76 and 20
*  You know the entire season it's to me it counts for something
*  Are they one of the three most disrespected 76 and 20 teams of all time?
*  Do you agree with me that this is the best version of Jalen we've ever had and it's not close
*  It's not close. This is the best version of him we've ever had
*  My Jalen stuff is well documented. I'm probably not as high on him as I need to be which doesn't mean to say that
*  I don't understand how special he is
*  I cannot believe some of the shot decisions and I can't believe how often these brutal
*  Turnarounds where i'm like that's what you're coming up with and then it goes in and then it just goes in so
*  Indiana series over and over again now granted. So well, they didn't have halibur
*  Well, something's to have prisingas but over and over again. They were in these close games and he made huge shots
*  Made a three in the corner to save game to save game one
*  Right game three and game four. He made huge plays in both of those games
*  He made big he made a big shot over turner in game three
*  He had big plays on both ends in game four and it's like well it was against the pacer
*  It's like at some point you got to give the guy some credit. I thought he should have made all nba
*  I made the case he didn't make it but you know, I think we've been pretty critical of him over the last few years
*  I think he is
*  Absolutely worked his ass off to get stronger
*  To be a better two-way player. I think he's competitive as fucking shit
*  The fact that he won that conference finals mvp. I thought was great. I thought
*  I I don't know whether he deserved it or drew but I thought it was awesome for him
*  Wait, you're drew or tatum
*  I actually I would have gone. I think I would have gone you can't vote for holiday. Oh, come on
*  I thought drew was incredible in that series. Oh my god plays
*  I just thought he was great
*  um
*  I thought they were very close like if any of them had won I would have been fine with it, but um
*  I don't know. I received a vote. It was five four voting. I get it. I get it. I thought drew was awesome. Um
*  I just think the stuff jae-lin has done
*  And the chip that he has on his shoulder, which is weird. It's the it's one of the only times ever
*  Somebody's got a massive contract and it actually turned out to be a good thing for their career
*  Usually it's the other way right? It's like I got this massive contract. Oh my god. I got fat
*  Oh, i'm not working this hard. Oh now the fans have turned on me. This is the opposite
*  This guy got this contract. He's been trying to justify it ever since it's been pretty cool
*  He's been so good he's he's been so good and I think his defense has gotten better
*  I think he's the primary guy defensively but it could have more to do with
*  tatum
*  Having to run more of their offense where it's kind of like the ant lesson we saw there where there's so many superstars
*  Be like wait, who's sga guarding or who's this guy guarding or how come like and you go well
*  The downside is but in the playoffs, you don't want to hear that kind of stuff
*  And jae-lin has taken that stuff on. I also thought that jae-lin had the easier defensive matchup
*  Instead of tatum and that tatum's gravity was impacting stuff a little bit more
*  That's why I would have voted for him for eastern conference finals mvp
*  But jae-lin had the three in game one. He had the pass to white to close it out
*  He had the block, you know
*  He just had some of these moments that I think the voters probably fell in love with there a little bit more so
*  I have talked about him non-stop
*  And I probably should look at him
*  as somebody who's delivered in so many of these playoff moments
*  And the problem for him was it turned into this guy who couldn't dribble with the offhand and the miami series got so ugly
*  And that lives in a way on the internet. That's like a tattoo
*  It just stuck to you, but this goes back to what we talked about earlier. It's
*  The perception of things versus what the reality of it was right like if I told you
*  jae-lin from 2020 to 24
*  75 playoff games
*  versus kairi
*  basically from
*  2019 to 2024 39 playoff games. Who do you think averaged more points?
*  I think 99 people out of 100 would say kairi
*  And it's jae-lin jae-lin averaged 23 points during that stretch kairi averaged 22 jae-lin shot 49 percent kairi shot 45
*  There's this weird
*  I and I think both of us are pretty aligned on this. It's been pretty
*  Awesome to watch kairi turn himself into a meaningful basketball player again. I think over everything else. We're going to root for
*  Good basketball and more good basketball players is always going to win the day
*  But now people have just tossed away the last seven years and allow the rollercoaster ride stuff with him
*  And all the missed games and some pretty bad playoff performances
*  And the way he's played in the 2024 playoffs is the best he's played in seven years
*  Well, we're aligned on this one and i'm fear that
*  It's it i'm we're just stating facts. Nobody nobody wants to hear from you or I because they think it's only about the boston thing
*  And I would remind everybody I think 2019 is one of my least favorite teams that i've ever watched
*  Yeah, and I couldn't wait for it to be over
*  so
*  I do think it speaks to how we treat winning
*  and that winning
*  Fixes everything about your perception
*  And it's if the rules I don't know when this changed maybe it's always been there but it's more pronounced now
*  but if you're coming at
*  People that were critical of kairi with this. Hey, where's the apology? It's like fuck off
*  Miss me with all like what am I supposed to do?
*  Like i'm psyched he's playing basketball again to the level that he's playing the stuff that he is capable of doing
*  Is as unique as we've ever seen for somebody that's small
*  But then it's like no now you have to do all this other stuff like I don't have to do any of that shit
*  I have to do any of it
*  Because i'm not going to
*  He's missed 205 games in the last seven years and was missed or hurt
*  Missed a postseason or was hurt in a postseason in four of those
*  um
*  I one of the revisionist history things with him is that
*  He I mean it was really dallas or buss from him last year because I went back and read some of the stories like
*  Did I remember this wrong because I I remember like
*  Both of us were kind of stunned that they gave him the contract they gave because we didn't know who they were competing against
*  So I went back
*  There was like a possible lakers thing, but he would add take the mid-level
*  And then it was like he's going to do an interview with phoenix, but that was but it was after bradley biel
*  Right, but they leaked they leaked that whole story because shams had it where it was right before the deadline for him to
*  Opt out of the nets contract that it was like you better trade me because i'm going to opt out and then i go for
*  The mid-level and you're like, okay cool and the net's call is bluff and then guess what?
*  He doesn't want to give up 30 million dollars to play for the middle level with the lakers
*  So he was he was on this tear of all of this stuff
*  It was all there and it all deserved criticism. It just did the same way his playing right now deserves praise
*  But we're very odd in the way that we'll cover things in our events
*  Where it's the present good is supposed to somehow erase
*  All of this stuff that was real and was just
*  I don't know. It was kind of pain in the ass
*  The agent roger ascii in late june went on sports center and he said
*  the market for kai rearving
*  Legitimate places that he would leave dallas for that makes sense that are available to him. It's extremely limited perhaps almost nil
*  The full expectation is he returns in dallas
*  I don't think the money will be as much of an issue as how many fully guaranteed years are there for kai rearving
*  That's where we were in june and we were there because of the six years before it
*  And then he turned his career around and it was a gamble that they had to take
*  Because there was really no other way for them to get a major free agent. I posted on twitter
*  I posted my notes from this podcast you and I did
*  At the end of march in 2023 remember they lost that terrible charlotte game
*  And they were 11th in the west there was like eight games left in the season. We were like
*  Oh my god, they might miss the playoffs with luca
*  and I had all my notes from that and the notes were like
*  Is luca in one of the worst situations of any under 30 star and I had him and lamello and ironically edwards
*  Stars best players that just missed the playoffs and it was like there's a barkley here. There's a dwayne wade here
*  I had that whole list too like we did the whole podcast thinking
*  There was no way this was going to turn around for dallas and then
*  In one of the great kind of basketball reconstructions that we've seen starting with them losing that pick and i'm getting that pick back
*  Doing the lab we trade dumping the burton's contract and they did all these things and it's it's really impressive
*  But it was also really bleak in june and I and for some reason that's been
*  Kicked out the window. Um, but it also helps too when we're talking about the second best player in the world at 25 years old
*  Going back to dallas and some of the stuff they did I went back because I was like this gafford washington thing feels unusual to me
*  I'm just going to go through all the seasons and try to figure out how unusual is this for a team to remake itself at?
*  The trade deadline and then it actually works
*  Right. So you go back I went back to oh eight the lakers did that palgasol deal which changed their season
*  They make the finals they lose but they made the season. Yeah, I mean it changed it changed three years
*  Well, but I mean it's specifically they made the finals that year they didn't win
*  The celtics made a very small pj brown trade that really helped them. He made a couple big shots against the calves
*  A little tiny deal not on the pj washington sense, but then
*  It really wasn't until 2015
*  When the calves did that they got shumpert and mosgoth and jr smith. They traded some picks
*  They didn't win that year in 16. They got channing fry
*  But you know, he still played for them 17. They got corver
*  18 they got clarks and nansen hood. They didn't win that year
*  This was the biggest trade deadline move that I saw that actually resulted in a finals
*  Same year was marcus all in 2019 for toronto
*  Where they traded for him they gave up real stuff for him. He was super impactful for them. They ended up winning the finals
*  Uh 2020 jay crowder miami 2022 celtics derrick white that helped them I think make the finals
*  And then gafford washington
*  It's really unusual
*  To trade around the fringes like this and get guys who can you can get 40 of your team at crunch time basically
*  um
*  At the trade deadline they paid a lot
*  I mean they definitely gave up a shitload for it and
*  Except especially when you include the grant williams they'd give up a pick just to sign grant williams, right?
*  so you're talking three first round picks
*  get those guys but um
*  It does make me wonder our team's going to get friskier on the trade deadline going forward
*  Like could this be one of those things where people go? Hey that high looking with dallas did they got those guys?
*  And maybe this is the new inefficiency
*  Once the rest of the decade because we have more parity at the top than I think we ever had
*  I don't think we have parity but I think we have
*  Contender parity or if you have one of the best eight to ten guys in the league you can at least
*  Whether you're phoenix whether you're okay c whether you're philly whether you're might whatever you feel like you're kind of
*  around
*  Sniffing around the title. So I don't know they like miami made a play for roger
*  I guess you could say that was the east coast version of a trade like that
*  But do you feel like we'll see more of those trades?
*  This is one of the worst trade deadlines we've ever done. Yeah, so there was that part
*  Where remember it was oh my god, but donovich donovich like look how smart the nicks are and they got births
*  Right and
*  I mean, I think we were at least good enough to to give credit to dallas
*  when it happened because
*  For whatever reason i've always really liked dapper and then pj's motivation to come back home and how inspired he's been throughout all this
*  And then on top of that the pj defensive assignments like there's a lot of time to robber horry. I don't remember us talking about that
*  No, not that part of it. I don't think anybody projected that so big shot pj
*  Right. I think this is one of those things where you look at it and go
*  Well, does that mean next february?
*  When we're doing all the look-ahead stuff the week of the trade deadline
*  We'll front offices actually go a last year. We would have been on the fence, but look what dallas did
*  So let's be more motivated to do it
*  I don't know. I think with the second apron, I think it's possible
*  I think the second apron may have well, go ahead. Go ahead. Well, I just think there's more
*  There's more talent just in general. So there's more of these guys when you think where the league was we we did this in a previous pod
*  Where the league was 20 years ago where the league was 10 years ago
*  Just from a top 75 top 100 guys in the league standpoint. There's more guys to get
*  And then I think from a superstar standpoint
*  We have more like really good guys than we did
*  You know like the all mba guys even the guys in that like 9 to
*  20 range they're just really
*  Just deeper so you might feel like
*  Hey, look at the league we've had a different champion every year since 2018
*  You're never that far away, maybe it becomes more like football
*  We're teams like if we're one of the eight teams, maybe we have a chance
*  I don't know that I'd go that far
*  Maybe maybe but it still seems that it ends up being some guy holding up a trophy. We're like, okay
*  Well, that makes sense
*  I mean if it's donch it you're gonna go okay second
*  But everyone will make them the best player in the world and forget about yoke
*  It should be sold in the trophy up and then if tatum's holding it up people are gonna go
*  You know
*  Is tatum actually closer to one than he is five because that'll be what's on the shows the next day
*  So that's still always the guiding rule of this league
*  But the reason I was even hitting at the second apron because I love thinking about the stuff that's going to happen with the second apron
*  We haven't really fully experienced the cuts that are going to have to happen
*  Where I look at bad teams with cap space, right? Like here's a perfect example
*  Look at the orlando magic you try to figure out like, okay, what are they gonna do with their cap space?
*  So in the past they just for a year a guy probably even pay them a little bit more to come to the magic
*  And then worry about paying all their young guys down the road
*  Well now I don't know that you can really do that if you want to keep franz palo and sugs
*  Which you would want to keep and then you're paying them big money
*  Like you may go well wait
*  We actually can't do the four-year thing in free agency with somebody who's this
*  The secondary maybe not even a secondary player, right? I think okay sees in the same boat, right?
*  Yeah, okay. See
*  I think that's why they wanted to do the hayward deal a little bit there
*  Where they were clearing up some of the money and then adding the cap space
*  But they also probably felt like maybe gordon, you know offers them up some kind of shooting and play making that really happen
*  About gordon. Yeah
*  He's basically like I missed it. Yeah, I missed it. You rarely see a gm be like, yeah missed it didn't work
*  my bad
*  Yeah, so I don't know if he was prior prioritizing what he thought he could be in a different environment outside of charlotte
*  Or if he was prioritizing a little bit more flexibility
*  Anyway, the whole point and the whole reason i'm making this as I tie it into
*  Will we see teams a little bit more active? I wonder if there'll be a surplus
*  Of some of these players that are margin players that become available prior to the trade deadline as owners start staring down the real
*  uh restrictions that they could be facing by being a first or a second apron team
*  As you look at some of these salaries like I was looking at some of the salary stuff this morning and how many teams are
*  Already projected over the second apron for 24 and 25
*  Will we have more players available because you don't feel like you can stockpile contracts the way you did in the past
*  And it's just a question
*  It's a theory but the math would make sense that maybe you're going to see more gaffords available
*  So it could be just a supply part of it more so than it is the motivation to match what dallas just did
*  Counter that might only be one season and then the media deal kicks in and all the numbers go way up
*  And then it'll be like yeah, not as afraid of the second apron
*  I still don't understand the gafford piece pj
*  look, I don't think there's any way to know pj was going to turn into robert hoary and it was kudos to dallas for
*  Figuring out identifying him, but there was still no real evidence for it
*  Gafford was playing really well for these shitty washington teams for years and the house always would talk about
*  Yeah, if anyone gets gafford that guy's good that guy would be like
*  I just don't know how the league missed that when they have these giant organizations with a bunch of scouts
*  Can we go to tatum for a second?
*  Didn't we already do that? No, just quickly
*  It's still sorry tatum 42
*  42 club that I have well because it it ties into luca
*  The 42 club that I love to do points rebounds and assists anytime. It's over 42 for a playoff
*  So it's usually a sign something's happening. So luca's no surprise at 47, right? So this goes
*  luca yoke, ajeanus kawaii duncan iris and kobe
*  Lebron like it's all the people you would think is on this list. There's no cheapies
*  By the way, I love stuff like this. I love numbers like this that just go
*  Oh, there's not one weird name there. It's not weird. I think when I came up with it
*  I think I got to 42 because I wanted to figure out a way to cut carl malone out of it
*  And for some reason 42 worked perfectly and then that allowed me to get everybody in and not have them in
*  um
*  The your guy barkley's there at 93 44.5, but tatum's on the list this year tatum's at 43.3
*  And I do think
*  Because tatum
*  It's a weird thing man when when it's not great
*  You really feel it and I think people have been watching him for so long
*  that they kind of do the glass half empty thing for him and there's
*  You know, we talked about this on preview pods like there's a little tim duncan itis with him too
*  Where it's just like
*  Luca's got the swagger and he's talking shit and he goes on these heaters and it's like this is fucking cool, man
*  There's nobody like luca nobody is ever going to be like, oh man tatum. There's nobody like tatum
*  But he's just been really really really high level
*  Good and efficient for a few years here now. He's been one of the six best players in the league for three straight years
*  Um, he's the best two way forward in the league
*  I don't count yanis as a forward as you know, I count him as a I think he's a big man
*  um
*  And I do wonder if like everyone's talking about this is gonna be luca's moment. This can be luca's moment
*  There's a flip side of this where it's like maybe this could be jason tatum's moment, too
*  There's a lot of pedigree building up toward this specific series
*  some of the matchups he has
*  He's gonna be the rebounding is gonna be huge for him the playmaking
*  Um, he's gonna have to go head to head with luca in a couple games
*  And this could be the moment for him too one way or the other, you know
*  I know it's more fun to talk about luca, but tatum putting up like
*  29 10 and 8 in a finals and beating dallas and winning the title
*  I don't I don't feel like we'd have any more tatum conversations after that
*  The numbers will have to be there but
*  Well, that's gonna happen. It's it's we already hinted at it kind of joked about it with the whole luca thing with the belt transfer
*  Of the segment we did a week ago
*  But if tatum has numbers even close to what he's just had throughout the east and they pull this off
*  There's going to be a big media tatum parade because there's no other way to do the job
*  27 10 and 6 and they win the title
*  And he's the best guy in the team
*  Then it'll be a reconsideration then people start talking about like kim versus kobe playoff points before age 27
*  Like man tatum might end up with a pretty amazing career here. It's gonna play 200 playoff games like there's
*  a whole bunch of checkpoints that would happen with that the luca thing is more fun to talk about because
*  You know you're talking about this this guy has a chance now to be one of the 15 best players in the history of the league
*  Right, but the visual thing that you mentioned is true because tatum is like duncan in the visual sense
*  Probably not even as extreme as duncan is like kobe
*  For as great as he is and the resume and it's it's all incredible
*  He's probably one of the best examples of being so visually pleasing that even in those big moments
*  Like you edit out a lot of a lot of the bad stuff. Yeah
*  you just
*  He presented himself as someone that in the game
*  Like nothing was more important and he was the one that wanted it more than everybody else. So he was he was good at
*  That his big shots were awesome
*  Right. It was just it was that much fun and luca is is certainly different visually than
*  Than kobe because we're just talking about a massive gap in athleticism
*  But luca's the way he carries himself and he kind of takes on this villain now as as the road guy
*  and part of it's because he's just
*  He's just once I think he steps in those lines
*  He cannot help himself
*  But being the biggest asshole and I think I mean that as a compliment like there's a reason why he's always getting into it
*  with somebody and I'd certainly rather that than somebody that's passive
*  but
*  Between the two I don't have any kind of debate where i'm like, oh is tatum actually better than like he's just not
*  Like there's no way no, that's not what we're talking about. I think I know it's way more fun to talk about luca
*  Like I wrote down I was thinking about this during the minnesota series
*  We haven't had
*  Like an old-school shit talker swagger guy like this in a long time
*  Like a guy who like actually seems like he likes being on the road sucking the soul out of the crowd
*  But also the best player too is what you're talking about and he could back it up
*  I'm saying like we're going back to like the bird magic era. We're going back to like jordan
*  This is the kind of shit that we grew up with
*  We're these guys who were like, I don't care if anyone likes me
*  I'm gonna make shots and just start screaming at some guy sitting courtside. He was like what's happening on with my daughter
*  Why are you yelling at me?
*  um
*  Just going nuts. He's I I wrote down he's a road quieter
*  there are these certain guys that are like
*  You know, I I always think the great players are always like on the road is always the best way to analyze them because they really thrive on like
*  Fucking shut all these people up
*  It's just like just silence and i'm just staring around i'm talking shit and i'm just basically pulling everybody's pants down
*  and as much as I love yokage like he you know yokage is
*  He he is who he is, right? I don't think he's in there like i'm gonna fucking shut up everybody
*  He just he plays then he goes and he and he leaves and he goes back to his country and rides horses
*  Luca's like luca was like this. This is one of the reasons I loved him so much heading the draft
*  He was doing this as a 17 year old and they were shown in those games on nba tv and it was unbelievable
*  he's going in these in these
*  Opposing arenas where like they were like kind of semi dangerous places and he's talking shit to like 30 year olds
*  It was like who who is this guy and he's carried it ever since
*  So I
*  I love thinking about
*  Luca the younger guy because we've seen his dad
*  Who just is a legend?
*  apparently just a legend and there's a slovenian hockey player here that is a neighbor
*  And I ran into some of his family members topitar and I ran into some family members
*  And they were like we were at the beach and I was talking to his family
*  And they all they want to talk about was luca
*  About was luca
*  Yeah the entire time and luca this and luca that his dad it was just
*  He's this mythical feat, you know
*  Just you think about some of these smaller countries where I think in the states we can just be like
*  Oh, it's another one of those guys in that part over there and like do you realize how small some of these places are?
*  Okay, and now they have a guy who's potentially
*  You know going to do this
*  It would make sense if luca does this based on his background his upbringing and him checking boxes and being ahead of schedule
*  As much as we fall in love with right
*  Yeah
*  We fall in love with new and new is fun because we think it's going to be something we've never seen it before
*  That's why the women yama stuff is so exciting
*  But at the same time like luca keeps going like oh wait, you didn't think I could do this yet
*  You didn't think I could do this yet
*  And that's the thing that scares the shit out of you on the self-excited side of it because you're just going
*  Yeah, this is this guy is supposed to win a championship because of all these things
*  But when you talk about his demeanor, I would love to know what he was like on the ride
*  to game five
*  Because watching him like did he know he's just going to those guys being like hey first quarter i'm gonna
*  I'm gonna take their fucking souls
*  First quarter because some of the shots he was taking it was apparent to me that he had decided
*  I'm gonna see what I can do here tonight
*  And yeah, granted he's probably feeling a certain way feels like he's a little bit more locked in he starts hitting all these deep threes
*  and he I know it was 18 18 because rudy was awesome on offense, but
*  It was it was just one of those moments was like man he showed up in an elimination game
*  It was like i'm not waiting around i'm gonna win it in the first 12
*  It reminded me of lebron in that 2012 game six game in boston
*  Which was the most important game probably his career
*  When he came out in the first quarter and was just making 20 footers with that crazy look on his face. It was like, oh no
*  This is bad, but the great guys they go into a game. They're like i'm fucking taking this in the first quarter
*  It was awesome he uh
*  He would have a chance here it's interesting for the youngest finals mvps
*  um
*  He'd be in the top 12 youngest. He's 25
*  It's a pretty good list. There's some guys like magic's on it twice kareem tim duncan dwayne wade bill walton
*  um, there's some weird ones too like dumar as a maxwell and dj but
*  Uh, yanis was 26 duncan was 26 the second time he won
*  It's right it's more conceivable than I thought as I was doing the research. I was like man lucas seems young and it's like
*  No, it's actually this is right around the time
*  Especially if he's somebody who has a chance to be a top 15 or 20 guy ever which I think we're on pace now
*  It's still kind of young though. It's 25 in february. It's a little young but it's not crazy
*  I think two years ago when in the 22 playoffs
*  When he went against the warriors in the conference finals if they had made it that year that would have been whoa
*  He's 22 that we're doing this now
*  A little like lebron in 07. We're like, whoa, we're doing this now
*  Um, this feels maybe a year early, but it's around when it should have happened. I think
*  He's so good. Yes, because lebron felt early not to say that we didn't realize how how good lebron
*  But that's still when you look at the rest of it, especially when you look at dallas granted
*  We've already talked about it. You've got to put this dividing line between who they were and who they became
*  And it's only gotten better
*  but
*  The issue I had was just navigating the landmines of the west
*  And I still couldn't get there with them
*  And as I watched the minnesota series I went
*  Hey, this might be the simple stuff of if you're really going to try to build a playoff team
*  They can go deep you need two on ball creators
*  You can't just have one and that was the difference between minnesota and dallas. Do you think denver would have beaten them?
*  I would have said that
*  But i'm not going to do it to dallas anymore. I've already been too disrespectful by not picking them
*  And by the way, I don't know that i've ever picked against a team
*  four straight
*  rounds
*  Miami doesn't count last year. I picked against them four times
*  So I don't I doubt they'll have ever been a time where I picked against a team in four straight playoff rounds
*  And they actually won the mba title like last year
*  Miami denver was easy to pick because I still thought the celtic series was one of the flukiest things we've ever seen
*  but
*  That had them over the clippers. I had them over the clippers in round one
*  And then I thought okay, so he was going to beat him could just be fair more because of how injured luca was
*  Yeah, once lennard was out. I went. Okay. Well now i'm not taking the clippers
*  So I guess there's a technicality there, but when I thought kawaii was going to play and be healthy the whole time
*  um
*  Well, yeah, I don't I don't know that I can ever think of a team that i'll i've
*  When the series started went, okay
*  I'm gonna pick against them and they won a title so that'll be a new one for me. I'll feel pretty i'll feel pretty proud
*  about that
*  One other thing dan shannis he wrote about uh
*  Curse the bambino no the celtics have a chance to end a drought. I think it was tongue-in-cheek, but I couldn't tell boston title drought
*  We haven't talked about haven't won a title since february 2019. It's been five years and four months
*  So he was having fun with it but it is the south the boston teams won 12 titles from february
*  2002 to february 2019 no titles in five and a half years
*  Apparently it's a trip
*  I think he was depends on depends on what your standard is
*  I think he was kidding. Uh, i'm gonna give you my favorite thing that I heard over the last couple days
*  I was driving back from work because we did rewatch it was on friday
*  And I was flipping around on the serious and that show speak was on fox
*  and one of the topics was
*  if dallas wins the title
*  Is kyrie the best sidekick of all time?
*  And one of the guys made the case. Yes
*  but he prefaced it and it was something I could I was driving on the highway so I couldn't write this down but he said
*  something like
*  Look, I know scotty pippen has six titles, but if if dallas wins this kyrie would have two
*  And then he went and i'm like, whoa
*  So we're tossing out
*  1986 kev mccale who is the best defensive center in the league and and shot 60% in the playoffs in 26 and 10
*  We're tossing out 2001 kobe
*  We're just gonna we're just gonna toss away sidekicks now and kyrie just because he looked good in a couple rounds as now
*  We're talking about him and the historical great sidekicks ever. It was friday was really great
*  yeah, that's
*  That's the part like people have lost their mind. I think in the kyrie conversation
*  I just think they have he's really fun to watch. I get it. He's super fun to watch
*  He scored 16 a game against oklahoma city. Yeah, he was fun to watch. I get it
*  But and jalen is just nobody's going to be like watch this jalen brown mixtape for six minutes
*  But jalen scored more points than him in the playoffs
