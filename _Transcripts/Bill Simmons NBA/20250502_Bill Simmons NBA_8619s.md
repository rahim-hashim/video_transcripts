# A Clippers-Denver Slugfest, Brunson’s Heroics and Best TV Shows | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8)
*  All right, recording the top part of the pod. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=0.0s)]
*  It's a little after 10 o'clock Pacific time. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=27.72s)]
*  I just drove back from the Cooper's nuggets game six, which was quite an affair. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=29.44s)]
*  Rob Mahoney is here. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=33.52s)]
*  Uh, Cooper's dominated the entire game. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=35.64s)]
*  James Harden was magnificent for three quarters. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=38.58s)]
*  He was. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  It looked like they were about to put the game away seven times and it was just [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=42.2s)]
*  going to go into the 17, 18, 19 range. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=46.44s)]
*  I was going to be able to drive home with six minutes left and start recording [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=48.620000000000005s)]
*  the pod with you and then all of a sudden the nuggets were within nine and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  they were within six and the PTSD could kicked in new arena, new energy, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=55.6s)]
*  really good team. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=62.56s)]
*  It didn't matter. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=64.12s)]
*  The crowd got fucking nervous and you could feel it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=65.12s)]
*  And I was getting flashbacks to 10 years ago, that Rockets game when they, uh, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=67.48s)]
*  when they blew that 19 point lead and they survived it mostly thanks to like a, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=71.68s)]
*  uh, crazy Russell Westbrook play. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=76.28s)]
*  Um, a couple of them, how many excruciating layups is Russell Westbrook [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=78.56s)]
*  going to miss this season? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=82.44s)]
*  We just, I went with my friend, uh, Mike, who I shared tickets with and we decided [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=83.67999999999999s)]
*  he was the MVP of the game because he did good stuff for both teams. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=86.92s)]
*  Everybody had a positive interaction with it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=91.84s)]
*  It's true. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=94.2s)]
*  Our guy balances the ledger. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=94.72s)]
*  You know, he knows what he's doing out there. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=96.28s)]
*  So I, I'll tell you what I saw in person, but what'd you see on TV? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=97.96s)]
*  What jumped out to you? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=101.44s)]
*  I think the Harden elements for sure. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=102.52s)]
*  But also like this felt very much like the Nick Batum game, a game in which [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=104.12s)]
*  Batum completely changed the energy, completely changed the strategy. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=108.84s)]
*  Tylou finally pulled the plug on some of Chris Dunn's minutes in the second half, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=113.0s)]
*  which the series had been kind of building to that point over the last three games [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=116.72s)]
*  or so, to be honest with you, it felt a little inevitable, but once it happened, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=120.24s)]
*  you could just, you could feel everything the Nuggets were trying to accomplish. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=123.88s)]
*  It seemed uphill from that point, just from having Nick [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  Batum on the floor. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=129.76s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=130.48s)]
*  I don't think Chris Dunn played in the second half. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=131.44s)]
*  Uh, a lot of the people in my section had been calling for this for a while, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=133.72s)]
*  just basically go bigger, longer. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=137.24s)]
*  But the thing I wasn't expecting was Batum had a bunch of reps on [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=139.4s)]
*  Jokic defending him. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=144.16s)]
*  Now we were playing a blood sport rules tonight. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=146.32000000000002s)]
*  I don't know if you noticed, I think there were less than 30 fouls total [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=150.08s)]
*  and it was the same both ways. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  So that was how it was going. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=155.32000000000002s)]
*  I went to the Laker game yesterday. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=157.0s)]
*  I think there was close to 50 fouls in that game and everything was a foul. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=158.44s)]
*  This game, nothing was a foul and they ever knew it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=162.88s)]
*  And Jokic, who was getting mauled every time he had the ball, but he was [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=165.28s)]
*  also mauling other people. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=168.96s)]
*  There was a couple of plays where he was just shoving Batum backwards. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=170.16s)]
*  He was shoving guys in the back to get rebounds. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=173.4s)]
*  Like every, it was just full on warfare, which I would think would benefit the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=176.6s)]
*  Nuggets, but I thought the Clippers with their size and their, and you know, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=181.84s)]
*  their physicality kept up with it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=185.52s)]
*  Yeah, you would think so, but honestly, I think when you allow them to be that [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=187.4s)]
*  handsy and that physical, this is the kind of series where if the Clippers [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=190.56s)]
*  can control the glass and specifically keep the Nuggets off the offensive glass [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=194.28s)]
*  for long stretches, it feels like they're in control of these games. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=198.28s)]
*  Like they're going to win the turnover battle so handily just by the nature of [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=201.4s)]
*  how they play and how Denver plays. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=204.64s)]
*  If you can keep the Nuggets from clawing back possessions through any other means, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=206.6s)]
*  you're going to be in pretty good shape to win the game. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=210.84s)]
*  And so that's one area where the physicality really pays off, not just, you [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=212.6s)]
*  know, battling Jokic to keep him off the offensive glass, but bumping and holding [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=215.88s)]
*  Aaron Gordon, bumping and holding Christian Brown, like bumping and holding [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=219.48s)]
*  Russell Westbrook, frankly. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=222.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=223.76s)]
*  So Harden comes out and you see it immediately where game five, he was [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=224.56s)]
*  terrible game six, he's doing that accelerator thing that he has where it's [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=231.2s)]
*  the herky jerky, I'm going, I'm stopping now I'm going again. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=237.2s)]
*  And he just said he was yo-yoing a bunch of the Nuggets defenders. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=240.32s)]
*  And so he's playing well, ankle wise playing well. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=244.6s)]
*  And I think they both ended up with almost 60 points combined. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=247.04s)]
*  Usually they're pretty hard to beat if both of those guys are going, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=250.04s)]
*  but he watching Harden just toasting everybody in the Nuggets. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=253.36s)]
*  And it's like, wait, just why don't you do this more often? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=257.0s)]
*  And then what you realize is he had about 90 minutes of him. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=260.16s)]
*  And by the fourth quarter, that acceleration thing, it wasn't there [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=264.84000000000003s)]
*  anymore and Denver had him figured out a lot of slow possessions reminiscent [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=268.24s)]
*  of, uh, of my Celtics, just a lot of like killing the shot clock. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  So you can get a terrible shot with three seconds left, like a corner [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=276.44s)]
*  three with a hand in the face and the Nuggets kind of clawed back. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=279.24s)]
*  I, I'm trying to think what to take away big picture, especially after [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=282.6s)]
*  going to two of these games. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=285.76s)]
*  And I really do think the Clippers are slightly better. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=287.4s)]
*  And I don't think that's going to mean they're going to win the series. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=290.28000000000003s)]
*  But I would say if it, if it's three to three right now, but it's [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=293.36s)]
*  like 3.3 to 2.7, I think the Nuggets have to be super pumped that they have [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=296.0s)]
*  a game seven at home, cause I don't, I don't think they played that well as a team. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=301.92s)]
*  They've certainly had their moments and they've had stretches where they felt [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=306.28s)]
*  really good and felt like they were clicking and playing their style. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=309.2s)]
*  This game ultimately did not feel that way. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=312.36s)]
*  Like they're still walking the line in so many respects between Jokic being [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=314.44s)]
*  as aggressive as he needs to be to dominate some of these matchups. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=318.8s)]
*  And particularly when the zone is out there, when Batum is guarding him [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=322.08000000000004s)]
*  ordinarily when Ben Simmons is guarding him, although now he's kind of out of the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=325.40000000000003s)]
*  series, he's gone like R RIP, Ben Simmons, Chris Dunn, RIP. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=328.28000000000003s)]
*  You had a good run. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=333.68s)]
*  Uh, but those are possessions Jokic just has to bulldoze his way and brute force [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=334.64000000000004s)]
*  his way into baskets because ultimately the Clippers are going to play off Russ. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=338.64000000000004s)]
*  If he's out there on the floor, they're going to shrink the floor around him, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  but take away the passing lanes. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=345.76000000000005s)]
*  And so Jokic is going to have to create tough baskets in crowds in a lot of [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=347.56s)]
*  these situations and he has to do that against Zutu. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=350.96000000000004s)]
*  And for all due credit, Zutu came up with some monster stops down the stretch of [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=353.32000000000005s)]
*  this game, game like game saving plays on the defensive end with all of that [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=358.32000000000005s)]
*  contact we've talked about, but he knew the prescription, like he knew what this [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=362.52000000000004s)]
*  game allowed and he played it to a T. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=366.0s)]
*  Well, it was interesting. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=368.08s)]
*  It seemed like they were going to bench him down the stretch. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=368.72s)]
*  I mean, we were watching, but it was that good. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=371.68s)]
*  It was crazy to think about. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=374.8s)]
*  And we were watching on the bench. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=375.92s)]
*  It was five. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=377.72s)]
*  It was like five minutes left. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=378.32s)]
*  There's a timeout and, but, and Zuu wasn't coming back in and we were, we [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=379.36s)]
*  were like, wow, he's, he's pissed. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=384.6s)]
*  Like he can't believe he's not coming back in. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=386.8s)]
*  And then I think the Nuggets scored once and Tylow was like, all right, get back [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=389.84000000000003s)]
*  in and then he made some big plays down the stretch, but I think this [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=393.52s)]
*  platoon piece is a really nice wrinkle for them on the road in a game seven. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=396.68s)]
*  Because a couple of things in their favor, one, Denver lost a game seven [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=402.12s)]
*  at home last year, right? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=405.76s)]
*  It was a year ago. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=407.36s)]
*  Two, they're a six man team, maybe six and a half. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=408.44s)]
*  I've actually kind of enjoyed the Deandre Jordan, um, just a couple of coffee [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=412.32s)]
*  minutes, I think I've actually been pretty effective, but it's a six and a [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=415.92s)]
*  half man team and the six man is Westbrook who giveth and taketh every single game. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=420.16s)]
*  And I do think if Harden and Kawhi play really well, if they stumbled in as [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=425.16s)]
*  something or this platoon thing, this is a team that could win on the road. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=429.44s)]
*  And then you think the other hand, you're trusting James Harden [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=433.0s)]
*  in an elimination game seven. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=437.08000000000004s)]
*  That's the catch, right? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=438.68s)]
*  And this is where I struggled to determine down the stretch of this game [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=440.0s)]
*  in the fourth quarter, as you mentioned, the acceleration wasn't there for Harden, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=444.88s)]
*  the pace he was playing with, just the downhill determination to blow by whoever [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=447.56s)]
*  was in front of him was not there. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=452.04s)]
*  Is that because he's James Harden at this age, at this point in his career, and he [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=453.92s)]
*  doesn't always have it all the time through every game, or was that them [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=457.84000000000003s)]
*  playing, playing at the clock basically, and trying to coast out a marginal lead [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=461.88s)]
*  against, you know, a run that the, like specifically Jokic was pushing the ball [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=466.52000000000004s)]
*  up court and they were starting to create some pressure and were they just [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=470.44s)]
*  trying to drain too much clock? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=473.2s)]
*  I couldn't quite tell which one was going on, to be honest with you. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=474.24s)]
*  My take would be he's like a pitcher who could get about six innings, maybe [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=477.16s)]
*  six and two thirds, but I thought the fourth quarter, I thought he wore down [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=482.48s)]
*  a little bit, he's making some weird decisions. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=487.20000000000005s)]
*  Like they, you know, they, the nuggets had gotten a stop. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=489.08000000000004s)]
*  I think there was like a minute and a half left and they inbound the ball and [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=491.88s)]
*  Harden dribbles right into a double team and Ty Lue has to burn a timeout. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=495.56s)]
*  And it was like, you could see the double team coming seven miles away. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=499.36s)]
*  And he just kind of fog headedly went into it. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=502.16s)]
*  And right across half court too, like the worst place to be. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=505.6s)]
*  Weird. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=508.68s)]
*  And he had, he had a couple of those down the stretch where you're thinking like, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=509.16s)]
*  is this just an old guy who's feeling the miles of the game or is this the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=512.16s)]
*  James Harden stuff we've been watching for his whole career in big spots? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=517.12s)]
*  Now, Kawhi on the other hand has come through in a ton of big spots. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=520.4s)]
*  And I think he had a couple, I got this moments, but really this, the [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=523.76s)]
*  Cooper's that, that corner three, which Dunn couldn't make, I think it was [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=527.56s)]
*  0 for 3 and then Batum and Derek Jones together. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=530.88s)]
*  I don't know what they finished with, but I looked at one of the timeouts [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=536.04s)]
*  and they were, I think four for 10. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=539.24s)]
*  And those four threes they hit were the difference basically in the game, right? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=541.28s)]
*  And they're two for 10 or one for 10. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=544.92s)]
*  I think the nuggets probably pulled this off. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=547.1999999999999s)]
*  The other thing it was a, it was a Michael Porter Jr. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=548.7199999999999s)]
*  milk carton game. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=552.04s)]
*  It was like, is he out there? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=553.8s)]
*  Oh no, there he is. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=554.8s)]
*  It was one of those. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=555.8s)]
*  And they finally yanked him and Russ got all his crunch time minutes. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=556.8s)]
*  It felt like they were trying to get him going in the second half. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=560.4399999999999s)]
*  And you just could see like it was one of his classic no-show games, like a good one. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=563.0s)]
*  He was probably due for one at this point in the series, to be honest with you. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=567.88s)]
*  But the, the three is like, yeah, Derek Jones is not going to hit every night in [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=570.68s)]
*  the same way that Chris Dunn won't hit every night and may not even be in the [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=574.6s)]
*  rotation anymore, but two I would expect to, but more importantly, I think the, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=577.16s)]
*  the possessions that led to those threes and led to so many, I would say kind of [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=581.0s)]
*  like random Clippers baskets where these like chaotic offensive rebound tipped by [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=584.24s)]
*  zoo bounces off three guys' hands, goes through a crowd and ends up with a random [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=589.4s)]
*  Clipper. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=593.36s)]
*  Those plays can seem really fluky, but when you're the team playing with as much [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=594.5999999999999s)]
*  effort as the Clippers are playing with and you're as engaged and you're flying [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=598.4399999999999s)]
*  around the court, like it felt like they were quicker to those balls in part, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=601.4799999999999s)]
*  cause they didn't have to push it the other way. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=604.64s)]
*  So they can fight for it in a different way than the Nuggets can. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=606.0s)]
*  But I thought they just turned up every single one of those plays that they [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=608.8s)]
*  needed to. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=612.0s)]
*  And then when you look at the total sum of all them, that's like a 15 point swing [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=612.4799999999999s)]
*  in this game ultimately, right? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=615.9599999999999s)]
*  Like the, the, the Russ missed layup coming down on the other end and ending up [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=617.3599999999999s)]
*  in a Norm Powell three, what should have been a four point game as a nine point [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=621.5999999999999s)]
*  game. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=624.88s)]
*  That's it right there. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=625.3599999999999s)]
*  Like the chaos of these games decides them. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=626.2399999999999s)]
*  And there's a real whole, I said this Sunday too, there's a real home court [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=629.0s)]
*  with the Clippers that I just can't believe exists. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=632.7199999999999s)]
*  I know. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=635.2399999999999s)]
*  You know, and it's not going to swing a game. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=635.88s)]
*  Like they lost game four at home. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=637.92s)]
*  It's not like it was deciding the game, but there's a real energy. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=639.3599999999999s)]
*  And when, you know, the crowd really likes Norm Powell and he gets going as [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=642.0799999999999s)]
*  they should, but when he hits a couple, it's like an electric shock for the [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=647.4399999999999s)]
*  crowd. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=651.28s)]
*  Like they're really, really, and that's probably when they get the most excited. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=651.6s)]
*  And then the other one is Kawhi will have a couple of moments is a stretches [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=655.0799999999999s)]
*  where he just like, he'll hit like three shots in a row or he'll hit like two [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=659.3199999999999s)]
*  shots and get a steal and block it. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=663.4399999999999s)]
*  And he'll just take over the game for like three minutes. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=665.04s)]
*  And I think the crowd now has a sense for when that's happening. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=667.28s)]
*  Now on the flip side, you know, I think Yokoch had maybe 18 in the first half [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=670.76s)]
*  and finished with 25, but it's just. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=675.04s)]
*  Continually terrifying. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=678.16s)]
*  At top of the key, whatever sort of, and they're, they're sending one guy, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=680.5600000000001s)]
*  they're saying two guys, but Tom's just standing behind him, just [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=684.48s)]
*  whacking him on the side. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=687.6s)]
*  I always felt like he was going to score. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=689.8000000000001s)]
*  So when every time he didn't score or they turned the ball over a block, that [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=692.0s)]
*  felt like almost a miracle. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=695.36s)]
*  I think in Denver, I don't know if they're getting some of those, uh, some of [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=697.12s)]
*  those mauling calls on, on Yokoch, but. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=702.08s)]
*  And maybe that's where you don't get some of the Clipper role players [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=704.72s)]
*  delivering in quite the same way. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=707.0400000000001s)]
*  Like when you were saying, you know, the Clippers are so hard to beat when [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=708.44s)]
*  Kawhi and Harden are both clicking at a high level, obviously true, clearly true. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=710.8800000000001s)]
*  Part of the reason it's true is because then it relieves the pressure. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=715.36s)]
*  So only one of say, Norm Powell and Zubot have to be a big time score, right? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=717.7600000000001s)]
*  It's taking, taking some of the edge off those guys where they can [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=722.32s)]
*  just kind of fill a role. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=724.8800000000001s)]
*  You go on the road, let's say Harden and Kawhi play well again, but now all of a [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=726.4000000000001s)]
*  sudden all of the role player shots are tougher. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=729.9200000000001s)]
*  Maybe the threes aren't coming quite so frequently. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=731.7600000000001s)]
*  Like that's, that's one of the trade-offs that just is really, really tough with [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=733.7600000000001s)]
*  road play, especially in a game seven. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=736.8s)]
*  And we're about to get a game seven with two of the best postseason performers in [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=738.92s)]
*  modern playoff history in Kawhi and Yokoch in particular. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=742.7199999999999s)]
*  So whatever reservations we may have about Harden or Michael Porter Jr. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=745.52s)]
*  or whoever else is involved in the series, I'm fucking psyched for it. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=749.3199999999999s)]
*  I can't wait. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=752.28s)]
*  Well, this was the dream for a bunch of different reasons, especially we would [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=753.04s)]
*  not have had basketball on Saturday. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=756.92s)]
*  It's true. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=758.9599999999999s)]
*  Group chat depends on that game set. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=759.8s)]
*  How did that shake out that way? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=762.4799999999999s)]
*  There's no contingency plans there where we're just not going to have games on [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=765.64s)]
*  Saturday, May, May 3rd or whatever day that is, that was a thing that was going to happen. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=769.52s)]
*  Um, so the over under on that game on Fandual, I always love game sevens. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=774.32s)]
*  And I think this is going to keep going down. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=779.5600000000001s)]
*  I think the over today was two 13. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=781.6s)]
*  The over for game seven is two Oh 4.5. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=784.5600000000001s)]
*  And I bet that goes under 200. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=787.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=789.12s)]
*  Cause game sevens rock fights, tense, slows down. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=790.08s)]
*  People don't really take chances in the same way. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=795.24s)]
*  Every single thing is. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=797.72s)]
*  Careful, careful, ugly. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=799.84s)]
*  You're not getting Derek Jones sitting four threes in the, in the corner. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=802.76s)]
*  You're not getting any of that stuff. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=806.44s)]
*  And you know, it'll, a lot of it will depend on how much they're [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=807.76s)]
*  letting both teams get away with. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=810.76s)]
*  I think the more they officiate the game, the better that probably is for [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=812.8s)]
*  Denver because of the way Yocach plays. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=816.6800000000001s)]
*  Um, do you think either of these teams is better than Minnesota from [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=818.72s)]
*  what you've seen for two weeks? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=821.8s)]
*  Now the Minnesota thing's interesting because the Lakers just might be this [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=823.36s)]
*  like incredibly flawed team that made Minnesota look really good. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=827.6s)]
*  They have no center. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=830.76s)]
*  I don't really have a point guard. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=831.88s)]
*  They had Luca gets hurt halfway through game five and just can't [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=833.1600000000001s)]
*  guard anybody or bounce off anybody. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=837.24s)]
*  I thought, I really thought he was a little compromised. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=838.9200000000001s)]
*  LeBron wore out, I think after four games and Minnesota might not be [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=841.64s)]
*  as good as they looked last night. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=845.6s)]
*  Who do you, if you had to rank the three, who, how would you rank them? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=847.36s)]
*  I think I might put the Clippers as the best of the three, even still. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=849.84s)]
*  I would too. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=853.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=854.2800000000001s)]
*  Uh, but it's, it's very, very close. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=854.6s)]
*  And then there's also the question of like, are we talking about head to [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=856.44s)]
*  head in a series versus sort of in a more abstract, universal sense? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=858.96s)]
*  Ceiling upside. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=862.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=862.96s)]
*  Ceiling upside. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=863.48s)]
*  I think the Clippers are, are the most versatile of these teams. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=864.36s)]
*  I think their defense can be as good as Minnesota's defense can be, but [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=868.1600000000001s)]
*  they have some, some qualities in terms of their half court offense that [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=872.4s)]
*  feel even a little bit more stable to me and a little less matching to [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=875.12s)]
*  dependent, right? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=878.68s)]
*  So I think there's just some things with the Clippers that I really, really like. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=879.28s)]
*  And I love Tai Liu pulling the levers behind all of those things. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=882.6s)]
*  Like I trust the flexibility of that roster and I trust the people making [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=885.48s)]
*  the decisions, even though one of them is James Harden in a game seven. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=888.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=892.36s)]
*  Well, and they, I like how they adjust in a game and in a series, right? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=892.68s)]
*  They'll try four or five, six things. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=896.68s)]
*  They'll change rotations, not in a panicky way. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=898.76s)]
*  Like, all right, we gave Ben Simmons a whirl and he shot an airball that went [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=901.28s)]
*  sideways and we're not going to see him anymore in that game. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=904.8s)]
*  And we're not going to see him anymore now. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=907.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=908.8000000000001s)]
*  Chris Dunn, they're just begging. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=909.84s)]
*  They're leaving him open by 10 feet. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=911.88s)]
*  Like when it's 10 feet, maybe it's time to get somebody else. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=913.6400000000001s)]
*  But I do think they have two lineups that I think really work in a muck it up. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=917.48s)]
*  Game seven. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=922.6800000000001s)]
*  One was that one we saw tonight where they just went long, right? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=923.36s)]
*  With the tomb, they had it. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=926.72s)]
*  The shortest guy was hardened on the, out of everybody that was out there. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=927.6800000000001s)]
*  And then that other one was that one they played new day into game four with [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=932.12s)]
*  the shooters when they did the zone and it was just the all offense lineup [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=935.56s)]
*  with bug Donovan. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=939.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=940.04s)]
*  And I think they have their typical lineup, but I think they have two levers [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=940.56s)]
*  to pull if the game gets weird, whereas the nuggets it's basically like, let's [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=945.0s)]
*  throw in Westbrook and just kind of see what happens. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=949.68s)]
*  It's like watching somebody light fireworks in their backyard. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=952.28s)]
*  It's like, just, just don't try not to hit the house. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=955.04s)]
*  Please stay with the tree. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=958.0799999999999s)]
*  Please don't just please shoot this up in the air. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=959.68s)]
*  Um, and he's their fireworks guy there and that they don't have a lot of moves. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=962.4399999999999s)]
*  It's like, is Jamal Murray going to have it? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=965.28s)]
*  Is Michael Porter going to show up? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=967.12s)]
*  Are we going to get good Michael Porter? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=968.48s)]
*  They don't really know what they're getting. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=969.76s)]
*  Can I talk out of both sides of my mouth about this a little bit? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=971.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=974.3199999999999s)]
*  Uh, I think the Clippers are the better team and I think they're going to lose [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=974.9599999999999s)]
*  in game seven. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=977.4399999999999s)]
*  So things working against them. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=979.16s)]
*  Road team game seven, James hardened in a huge game. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=982.28s)]
*  Yep. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=986.4399999999999s)]
*  Um, Yoko is the best player in the series, although Kawhi, maybe he has [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=987.48s)]
*  something to say about that. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=991.68s)]
*  Um, the fact that Porter was so bad today makes me think he's going to be good in [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=993.8000000000001s)]
*  game seven, cause that's basically what we saw in the game four that I went to on, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=999.96s)]
*  uh, on Saturday where he was awesome and rebounding and playing with a ton of. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1004.5600000000001s)]
*  Athleticism. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1009.24s)]
*  So I went, I bet they were going to subtly call him out and challenge him. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1009.96s)]
*  And I really liked the way Murray is moving and just looks in general. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1013.52s)]
*  Like, yeah, if he had played this way, uh, in the, in the summer Olympics, I [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1017.08s)]
*  think Canada would have won the gold medal. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1022.48s)]
*  It was, he did the opposite, but they've been trying to get him to play that way [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1024.24s)]
*  in the Olympics for a long time. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1028.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1029.56s)]
*  I know the ships probably said, I don't think it's going to happen, but I will [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1029.8s)]
*  say this Clippers win is particularly impressive in that way because Jamal came [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1034.0s)]
*  out hot, he was, he was scorching right from the jump and it's, it's hard in [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1037.2s)]
*  those Jamal Murray games to then put him back in the box to kind of tamp down his, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1042.04s)]
*  his sort of fire starter scoring. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1047.2s)]
*  I thought they really got a handle on him. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1048.72s)]
*  They made him into more of a passer in a way that opened up some shots for other [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1050.36s)]
*  people, but ultimately took some of the momentum out of the Nuggets offense. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1054.1999999999998s)]
*  So big picture legacy stuff. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1057.6799999999998s)]
*  Let's do a little legacy. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1059.4399999999998s)]
*  Pre game seven legacy. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1061.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1062.56s)]
*  A little, a whiff of a legacy here. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1062.6799999999998s)]
*  Uh, Jokic losing two game sevens at home and back to back years when he's the [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1064.76s)]
*  best player in the world would not be great. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1069.1999999999998s)]
*  Not awesome. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1071.6799999999998s)]
*  Um, the Nuggets blowing two game sevens at home in a row is a pulsating sign. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1072.76s)]
*  That's something that needs to happen. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1079.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1082.12s)]
*  They lose this. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1082.6s)]
*  It's like now something, now we have to do something. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1083.36s)]
*  Somebody has to go. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1086.9599999999998s)]
*  That sign has already been lit. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1088.4399999999998s)]
*  I think it's already been pulsating. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1090.1599999999999s)]
*  You know, we've, we've, I think we've been there for a little while. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1092.1999999999998s)]
*  It's pulsating, but I'm not sure it's on 24 hours a day. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1095.4399999999998s)]
*  I don't think it's like a diner sign, a fluorescent diner sign, but I think it [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1098.24s)]
*  does pop on, but yeah, there's multiple guys. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1102.6399999999999s)]
*  I would wonder. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1105.8799999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1107.08s)]
*  And if you, if you work back for keepers, it's basically just [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1107.3999999999999s)]
*  Yocage Murray and Brown. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1110.3999999999999s)]
*  And then you could tell me. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1111.6799999999998s)]
*  Anyone else on the team who knows? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1113.8s)]
*  So, and I think Gordon's a keeper, but I think he would be the trade piece. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1115.28s)]
*  If you're going to blow it up, you know, that is fair. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1119.04s)]
*  I think that was kind of my hesitation point. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1121.56s)]
*  As you were saying that it's like Aaron Gordon, Mr. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1123.4399999999998s)]
*  Nugget, like he is part of the DNA of that team. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1125.04s)]
*  He's also, you know, per the conversation you were having with Zach the other day [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1128.0s)]

*  far tonight, right next to the clipper game. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1313.52s)]
*  And it took an hour and a half to get to a clipper game. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1315.56s)]
*  And my plan was to watch the fourth quarter on my phone at the clipper game. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1318.3999999999999s)]
*  And I could not do that, but I was listening on, on a serious and just kind [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1321.84s)]
*  of playing off the announcers and it was the Detroit Pistons announcers who [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1326.8799999999999s)]
*  were very, very excited. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1330.56s)]
*  And, uh, Jalen Brunson did it again. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1332.6000000000001s)]
*  So what did, what did you see? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1335.28s)]
*  Because I unfortunately could not watch the game with my eyes. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1336.6000000000001s)]
*  I could hear it. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1339.64s)]
*  I couldn't watch it. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1340.2s)]
*  What'd you see? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1340.88s)]
*  Do you feel better or worse about the Knicks after tonight? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1341.96s)]
*  I mean, better because they won by, you know, the skin of their teeth better [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1344.64s)]
*  because Jalen Brunson is an amazing crunch time performer. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1348.16s)]
*  Like the, the fact that, so have you seen that play? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1351.04s)]
*  I assume you've seen the highlight. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1354.08s)]
*  Yeah, I saw the highlight. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1355.08s)]
*  I watched it half time. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1356.28s)]
*  Genuinely unbelievable how much space Jalen Brunson creates off of pure torque [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1358.16s)]
*  and crossover against one of the best perimeter defenders in the league, Anasar [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1363.4s)]
*  Thompson, a guy who had been giving him trouble, even in a high scoring night, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1367.4s)]
*  basically throughout the game when he was allowed to play by JB Pickerstaff. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1370.96s)]
*  And we can talk about that if you want. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1374.28s)]
*  Uh, I'm just like in awe of the space that Brunson creates. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1376.0s)]
*  And I think this is what fuels some of the conversation we have about him [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1379.88s)]
*  sometimes about the free throw baiting is when he doesn't do it. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1382.76s)]
*  And he didn't, there's no push off on this play at all. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1385.8s)]
*  Like he creates all of that space on his own, no illegal contact cans it [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1388.2s)]
*  because he's Jalen Brunson, one of the most clutch players that we have in [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1393.2s)]
*  the league right now. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1396.48s)]
*  I love watching that guy play. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1397.6399999999999s)]
*  I love watching that guy hoop. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1398.84s)]
*  And when he's doing it in this way, like he's, he's such an undeniable [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1400.48s)]
*  charismatic basketball force. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1404.24s)]
*  And yet heading into that next round, the Celtics are minus 700 favorites. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1407.32s)]
*  Now, if I told you before the year, the Celtics and Knicks are going to play in [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1411.88s)]
*  round two and the Celtics are going to be seven to one favorites, I think we [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1415.2800000000002s)]
*  would have thought somebody was hurt on the Knicks. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1419.5200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1421.8400000000001s)]
*  We would have assumed Townes Brunson or Inunobi, one of those three or maybe [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1422.48s)]
*  even Bridges, but some that was not a healthy five, but it is a healthy five. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1428.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, I know Brunson's slipping around, he had 40 tonight. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1431.72s)]
*  Well, or the other assumption would be that the cat trade had gone really [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1434.5200000000002s)]
*  poorly for some reason, which it hasn't. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1437.8400000000001s)]
*  It's gone mostly quite well, not so well in this game. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1440.0s)]
*  I thought this was a game in which it was very much Josh Hart and OG and [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1442.6799999999998s)]
*  McHale completely delivered in all of their kind of peripheral capacities. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1446.84s)]
*  In addition to Jalen Brunson just going balls out as far as like shot creation [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1450.6799999999998s)]
*  goes, and then cat is doing a thing we've seen him do before. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1454.8s)]
*  We're sort of floating around and he's weirdly passive and he's not [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1458.52s)]
*  involved in the offense. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1461.9599999999998s)]
*  And then when the ball finally comes his way, he's shooting shots five [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1462.9199999999998s)]
*  feet behind the three point line. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1466.04s)]
*  He's shooting shots five feet behind the three point line. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1467.76s)]
*  It's, and then he fouls out and misses a crucial free throw. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1470.52s)]
*  It was just like a, not a great display of Carl Anthony Towns as a [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1473.76s)]
*  basketball experience, especially going into a series against the Celtics [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1477.64s)]
*  where he has to be one of the Knicks most important players to actually [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1480.76s)]
*  leverage that matchup. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1484.68s)]
*  And I really like cat. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1486.0s)]
*  I find myself as a cat defender in a lot of debates and conversations. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1487.52s)]
*  I don't have a lot of faith in his ability to successfully bully and score [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1491.44s)]
*  on and be everything defensively that he needs to be against the Celtics. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1495.52s)]
*  It's just not, it's not that that matchup does not position him [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1498.76s)]
*  for any kind of success. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1502.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1505.0s)]
*  It's a weird one with all the Knicks fans. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1505.2s)]
*  I know, and I'm sure you know a lot of them too. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1507.28s)]
*  Um, last year they were just so delighted by that gritty underdog team that they [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1509.84s)]
*  had, and they just really responded to those guys. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1515.2s)]
*  And this year it's a lot of complaining, a lot of complaining about Tibbs, a [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1517.96s)]
*  lot of wondering, but, but then also a real love for Brunson. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1523.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1527.04s)]
*  And the fact that at least they got to round two with those five guys healthy, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1527.28s)]
*  which is, I think was the number one goal, a team that was built to try to [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1530.92s)]
*  beat Boston, even though Boston spanked them all season. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1534.52s)]
*  Um, I do not have any Knicks fans in my life who are like, watch out for us. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1537.8s)]
*  The vibes are real weird right now. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1542.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1544.4s)]
*  Don't you think? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1544.76s)]
*  I mean, they, again, barely survived this series. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1545.52s)]
*  The Pistons had several chances to potentially win it, several chances to, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1548.1200000000001s)]
*  you know, lead and protect the lead. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1551.96s)]
*  Malik Beasley almost had a look to tie this game at the very end, but kind of [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1553.8400000000001s)]
*  like Gary Trent Jr. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1557.04s)]
*  the ball away at the final second. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1558.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1559.88s)]
*  Like it was right. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1560.52s)]
*  Is that a verb now? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1561.4s)]
*  Gary Trent Jr. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1562.48s)]
*  did? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1563.48s)]
*  After that implosion the other day against the Pistons, unfortunately, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1564.72s)]
*  it's wrong place, wrong time, but such is life. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1567.72s)]
*  Uh, but I would say as far as the reason that that Celtics optimism and [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1570.4s)]
*  Knicks pessimism exists, in addition to just, you know, not disputing the heart [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1574.68s)]
*  of a champion and kind of the general funkiness that's been going on with New [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1579.32s)]
*  York all year, you could see in this series, it's so clear that the Knicks just [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1582.2s)]
*  do not trust basically anything other than a Jalen Brunson ISO. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1586.96s)]
*  Like they, they don't run them consistently enough, maybe a pick and roll [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1590.92s)]
*  if you're lucky, but so much of their offense is geared around Jalen having to [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1594.92s)]
*  create every inch of space against defenders. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1598.56s)]
*  And now. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1601.44s)]
*  It's a weird one to me though. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1602.6s)]
*  I don't really understand that as a strategy. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1604.0s)]
*  I get it from the sense that Jalen Brunson is an unbelievable ISO score. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1607.28s)]
*  I don't get it in the sense that you just traded for Carl [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1611.12s)]
*  Anthony Towns in the off season. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1613.24s)]
*  You just traded for Mikhail Bridges in the off season. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1614.6s)]
*  And some of those guys are good at kind of creating movement within stale sets, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1616.6399999999999s)]
*  but it really doesn't take much of a nudge from the defense to push the [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1621.0s)]
*  Knicks into just ISO, ISO, ISO, ISO repeatedly in a way that is frankly self-destructive. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1625.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, you know, who eats, eats that up for breakfast, lunch and dinner is [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1630.6399999999999s)]
*  the Celtics, if you're just going to do the same thing over and over again. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1634.1999999999998s)]
*  They couldn't be more delighted. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1636.92s)]
*  I mean, Brunson had 33 shots tonight and eight free throws. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1638.24s)]
*  33 shots is for a non-overtime game is, is kind of bonkers. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1642.3600000000001s)]
*  And I just don't feel like they've, I felt that the whole year, I've never felt [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1648.52s)]
*  like they've, it feels like somebody's always losing when somebody else is [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1652.1200000000001s)]
*  winning on this team. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1655.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1656.8000000000002s)]
*  You know, it's like almost like a zero sum game. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1657.68s)]
*  Brunson gets 33 shots. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1660.2s)]
*  So that means Towns has to have a shit game basically. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1661.6000000000001s)]
*  And again, I need to watch the second half and study what was going on, but I [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1664.52s)]
*  just, 33 shots is fucking, that's a crazy number. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1669.16s)]
*  I know he made 15 of them, but that not sustainable. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1673.28s)]
*  It's Celtics. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1675.76s)]
*  Celtics have so many guys to throw at him. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1676.3200000000002s)]
*  They're going to be sending two guys at them. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1678.8000000000002s)]
*  They're going to be putting taller guys on them. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1681.8000000000002s)]
*  This is one of the Tatum superpowers is he's actually really good at guarding. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1683.4s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if they threw Tatum at him. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1687.68s)]
*  You should. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1690.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean, based on a Sarthompson success in this game. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1691.64s)]
*  To the extent that there is a Jalen Brunson blueprint and this guy just [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1694.36s)]
*  went for 40, like it's not a wildly successful blueprint. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1697.0s)]
*  I thought a Sarthompson did a great job with the minutes that he was given [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1700.96s)]
*  and the assignment he was given. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1703.96s)]
*  And that's kind of the Jalen Brunson story is you try to put as much [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1705.08s)]
*  length as you can get away with. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1707.72s)]
*  It's just usually wings and bigs have a much harder time hanging with, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1709.1599999999999s)]
*  with Brunson's footwork. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1713.48s)]
*  Not so for the Celtics. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1715.0s)]
*  Like they have enough bigger range year defenders and even the guys who are [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1716.24s)]
*  quote unquote small drew holidays healthy enough to play consistently in that [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1719.2s)]
*  series. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1723.0s)]
*  That's, that's a tough matchup. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1723.8s)]
*  Derek White's a tough matchup. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1724.96s)]
*  They're all tough. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1725.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1726.32s)]
*  Well, the other thing is the Tatum has been just playing so great and the [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1727.2s)]
*  Knicks built this team together part, partly to go toe to toe with Tatum and [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1731.96s)]
*  Brown Brown hasn't been as great. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1735.96s)]
*  And I don't think he's a hundred percent healthy, but Tatum is at the complete [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1737.8s)]
*  command of his powers at this point. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1741.72s)]
*  And, you know, there's going to be this in an OB versus Tatum piece and then [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1743.72s)]
*  Bridges will be the second guy. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1747.92s)]
*  I'm sure they're going to stagger him so that, you know, there's going to be [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1749.64s)]
*  stretches, maybe he'll come out earlier in the first quarter and then come back [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1753.0800000000002s)]
*  where he's trying to go against some Knicks bench guys. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1756.88s)]
*  Um, what is your level of satisfaction with the Tatum rise as I would say the [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1759.8400000000001s)]
*  preeminent author of the does Tatum have another gear ongoing conversation? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1764.3200000000002s)]
*  I feel, I feel vindicated and delighted. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1770.3600000000001s)]
*  I just think he's been awesome. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1773.3600000000001s)]
*  And there was somebody wrote a piece about angry Tatum in that Orlando [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1774.92s)]
*  series and I totally agree. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1778.76s)]
*  He had developed this little sneer that he has now. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1780.08s)]
*  It's like, where'd that come from? [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1782.84s)]
*  You're like the nicest guy. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1783.96s)]
*  Now you have like a playoff sneer, but the sneer is worth like three percentage [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1785.52s)]
*  points in terms of field goal percentage easily, at least a couple of free throw [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1789.16s)]
*  attempts, it's worth its weight in gold. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1792.44s)]
*  I love his, uh, the bully stuff that he does, which is going to be harder to do [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1794.4s)]
*  against this next team, but they're going to be, I just think they're going to [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1798.8s)]
*  hunt Brunson. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1802.36s)]
*  This is what the smarter teams who have a lot of options, they're just going to [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1803.64s)]
*  be like, where is he? [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1808.64s)]
*  Let's try to wear him down on this end. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1809.68s)]
*  They're probably not going to defend them full court, which I think if like [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1811.88s)]
*  Indiana played them, I think Indiana would try to wear them down that way and [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1815.2800000000002s)]
*  just basically make them work to dribble the ball up to trade that some of that [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1818.2s)]
*  too, but you'll get some of that with OG just like denying at various, I'm sorry. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1821.5200000000002s)]
*  I think in terms of more Tatum, like I think there's, there's just so many [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1827.1200000000001s)]
*  ways that on both sides, they can deny the stars and force you to go to your [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1830.8000000000002s)]
*  second option. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1834.3600000000001s)]
*  And for the Celtics, there's many avenues from that point for the Knicks, like you [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1835.2s)]
*  deny Jalen Brunson, you chase him full court, even if that's what they decide to [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1839.28s)]
*  do, there should theoretically be many entry points for this offense, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1842.3200000000002s)]
*  realistically. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1847.4s)]
*  And in terms of the way these games play out, they just kind of wait for Jalen [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1848.24s)]
*  Brunson to get open. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1851.24s)]
*  And sometimes he does it. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1852.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's not, if the Celtics are healthy, that's not going to work. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1853.3200000000002s)]
*  The question would, the fear for the Celtic fans is how healthy are we? [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1855.88s)]
*  What's going on with your holiday? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1859.28s)]
*  Sure. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1860.64s)]
*  Are they playing it super safe or is this a guy who's in his mid thirties now [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1860.84s)]
*  who has a hamstring issue issue? [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1865.6399999999999s)]
*  And this is going to bug him the whole time. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1867.48s)]
*  How bad is Jalen's knee? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1870.1999999999998s)]
*  When's the next porzingis injury? [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1871.9599999999998s)]
*  Like there's, you know, uh, getting the, getting the rest and not having to play [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1873.52s)]
*  a game six against Orlando, I think was pretty good. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1878.12s)]
*  If I'm a Knicks fan, I'm really concerned that it was that much of a slug [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1881.12s)]
*  fest, knockdown, drag out back and forth series with Detroit. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1886.28s)]
*  You know, and I know that we talked about them a bunch on your pod on my pod. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1891.6s)]
*  Like we all respected Detroit. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1895.4s)]
*  The advanced metrics are very favorable. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1897.08s)]
*  They turned into be a good regular season team, but they're so limited in a [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1898.8s)]
*  series like that, like the guys that they had versus the guys that Knicks had. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1902.96s)]
*  I just don't feel like the series should have been this nail biter for six games. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1907.44s)]
*  I don't think they should have been able to go in there and win a game five at [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1912.08s)]
*  MSG. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1915.56s)]
*  I don't think this game tonight should have come down to Brunson [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1916.32s)]
*  having to be like heroic. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1919.36s)]
*  Like the Knicks should just be better than that team. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1920.72s)]
*  So that's, and I think some of it is coach related, which we've talked about [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1923.36s)]
*  on all of our ringer pods. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1927.6s)]
*  Like, I just don't think Tibbs has a feel for this team. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1928.96s)]
*  This doesn't feel like a tibetot team in my opinion. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1931.44s)]
*  I think all of that's true about the Knicks. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1934.36s)]
*  I just don't want to diminish the fact that the Pistons grabbed those games, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1936.28s)]
*  like grabbed those wins and nearly grabbed this one. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1940.72s)]
*  And I think that that's a team there's a lot to be proud of in terms of the way [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1942.9199999999998s)]
*  they acclimated themselves to this series, to this dynamic. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1945.8799999999999s)]
*  You're right. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1949.3999999999999s)]
*  They don't have all of the options that the Knicks do. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1949.84s)]
*  They don't even have, I would say, you know, the high, the highest end [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1951.9599999999998s)]
*  experienced playoff shot creation yet. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1955.3999999999999s)]
*  I thought Cade was really, really solid in the series overall, but you can see a [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1957.6799999999998s)]
*  bit of a distance between him and Jalen Brunson, right? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1961.6s)]
*  You can see where Cade still has to go as a young creator. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1963.76s)]
*  And that's really exciting. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1966.84s)]
*  And you can see, you know, what a Sartre Thompson can be. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1967.9199999999998s)]
*  You can see overall for a team that was missing two crucial rotation players, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1970.16s)]
*  right? Isaiah Stewart barely played in this series. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1974.64s)]
*  Jaden Ivey did not play in this series. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1976.72s)]
*  Like that's a huge deal. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1978.24s)]
*  And I think saps the Pistons ultimately of their hopes of being more dynamic. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1979.8000000000002s)]
*  And then then you get into a position where it's like when push comes to push [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1984.1200000000001s)]
*  comes to shove, like, I don't know, Tim Hardaway Jr., like Malik Bezal, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1987.48s)]
*  these guys are your are your kind of security blankets. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1991.16s)]
*  Tim Hardaway didn't play in the finals last year. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1993.72s)]
*  He was on a team that made the finals and did not play. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1996.72s)]
*  And for good and fair reason. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=1999.28s)]
*  And yet in this game, it's like he's essential personnel [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2000.8400000000001s)]
*  because of who the Pistons have on their roster. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2003.2s)]
*  And so that's that that will gradually improve over time as they sort of like [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2005.3600000000001s)]
*  start to replace some of the archetypes of these supporting players [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2009.32s)]
*  and maybe replace them with, you know, Jaden Ivey coming back [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2012.8400000000001s)]
*  and having another great season. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2015.48s)]
*  You know, like there's there's young talent Ron Holland, who kind of got, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2016.68s)]
*  I would say, kind of filtered out of the rotation by the end. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2019.28s)]
*  Maybe he starts to pop in a different way. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2021.64s)]
*  They're these are all different in terms of what they're bringing to the table. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2023.4s)]
*  But I like where the Pistons are headed. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2025.96s)]
*  Kind of like a stealth Durant team. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2028.76s)]
*  Wouldn't say he was the favorite, but it's a really interesting one. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2031.92s)]
*  If you're going to try to figure out a Durant destination and that the price [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2034.48s)]
*  gets a little lower, but you just kind of put him in the Tobias Harris spot. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2038.44s)]
*  I mean, they're not close to winning a title, but you think Tobias [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2041.48s)]
*  Harris for Kevin Durant's a pretty solid upgrade? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2045.04s)]
*  Well, I'm thinking about how many picks would have to be in that. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2047.32s)]
*  But if they're trying to get picks, I, you know, fire the Pistons. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2050.72s)]
*  I would probably try to do with some of these other teams [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2054.24s)]
*  in that position have done in years past is, Hey, it was great. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2056.36s)]
*  We got our playoff taste. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2060.2400000000002s)]
*  Let's try not to get crazy. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2061.88s)]
*  Let's do this again. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2063.44s)]
*  And then maybe two years from now, you know, they're probably hoping [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2065.56s)]
*  the stories are already starting to come out about how the Celtics, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2069.6400000000003s)]
*  this is kind of a last run with the roster they have and expect some trades. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2072.1200000000003s)]
*  You know, I'm not surprised that came out. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2077.36s)]
*  I I'm not surprised people did the math and was like, yeah, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2080.2400000000002s)]
*  this is probably not sustainable. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2083.2000000000003s)]
*  The timing of it was a little weird. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2085.0s)]
*  I was wondering why it became a story when it was, it's been a story all year [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2086.7200000000003s)]
*  for anybody who follows the Celtics, any capacity, the roster is going to [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2091.2400000000002s)]
*  cost like 250 million extra if they don't like trade some salary. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2094.32s)]
*  I don't know who it's going to be. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2099.0800000000004s)]
*  Um, so there's a little bit of this last dance run just with this, this [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2100.6400000000003s)]
*  specific group and it might just be one guy. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2106.0s)]
*  Um, but I, I, I, Bob Ryan's coming on this pod later and we're talking [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2109.28s)]
*  about like just what a popular Celtics team this is with the, with the fans, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2113.84s)]
*  like just a bunch of like dudes. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2118.8s)]
*  There's no, like the one guy are like, Oh man, that guy drives me crazy. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2121.44s)]
*  It's like, it doesn't, it doesn't really exist. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2124.36s)]
*  So, um, one last thing with Celtics next, you would think there would be all [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2126.88s)]
*  of these great storied battles over the years and there just hasn't been. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2131.44s)]
*  Um, you know, I was too young to remember when they played in the seventies. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2135.04s)]
*  I do remember the 84 series, which was Bernard versus Larry, which is, was just [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2140.48s)]
*  awesome Bernard basically beat this awesome Celtics team by himself for three games. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2144.76s)]
*  They beat them in 1990. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2149.0s)]
*  Um, I think they played maybe in 2013. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2151.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2156.36s)]
*  I want to say we got it. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2156.6400000000003s)]
*  Didn't we get a mellow? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2157.52s)]
*  It was the tail end of the KG Pierce era. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2159.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2162.0800000000004s)]
*  But for two teams that have been in the NBA since it began, it's pretty crazy. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2163.36s)]
*  It's fucking nuts that they have no play out. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2167.68s)]
*  Cause I, Oh, what a rivalry. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2169.7599999999998s)]
*  It's like, this really isn't a rivalry, but this, this is probably the closest [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2170.88s)]
*  the two teams have been, um, from a talent standpoint, I would say. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2174.8s)]
*  Um, maybe 84, I thought the Celtics were way more talented, but Bernard was maybe [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2179.36s)]
*  the second best player in the league that year. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2183.72s)]
*  Um, so that this will, it'll be fun to see it. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2185.84s)]
*  I think it's going to be really hard ticket to get in New York. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2188.44s)]
*  Sure. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2190.52s)]
*  Um, there'll be some energy behind it. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2190.96s)]
*  And from an ESPN standpoint, they lost the Lakers. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2193.08s)]
*  But they get Nick Celtics. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2196.56s)]
*  We just moved right to the next, right? [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2197.2s)]
*  We moved right to Nick's content. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2198.7999999999997s)]
*  What happens? [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2200.24s)]
*  I don't know what they do. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2200.8799999999997s)]
*  You don't think Clippers and Nuggets are moving the needle in that way? [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2202.08s)]
*  I don't, I, well, they'll probably, they'll get five more days of LeBron. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2204.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2207.96s)]
*  I, I'm fully expecting from somebody from the Lakers. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2209.04s)]
*  LeBron is open to resigning, but wants to make sure Luca is [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2212.12s)]
*  committed to being shaped next year. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2215.3599999999997s)]
*  I'm waiting for that story. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2216.72s)]
*  I'm on pins and needles. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2217.7999999999997s)]
*  Just sneak that one out. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2219.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2220.7599999999998s)]
*  Uh, I am waiting for the Austin Reaves. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2221.08s)]
*  If they have to trade Austin Reaves to get a big guy, you know, you saw what [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2223.44s)]
*  happened with Rudy Gobert, we got to do it. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2228.04s)]
*  Um, I'm waiting for that one. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2230.04s)]
*  Um, maybe it'll be trading for Rudy Gobert. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2232.2000000000003s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2234.6800000000003s)]
*  Um, you just laid out like four different news cycles. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2235.28s)]
*  I think we're good through June, to be honest with you. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2237.8s)]
*  We're good at least around two with all the site. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2240.04s)]
*  Why I forgot the will LeBron retire or not. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2241.84s)]
*  We're going to get that one. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2244.1200000000003s)]
*  He might, he might not. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2245.2400000000002s)]
*  Uh, now he's thinking about it. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2246.32s)]
*  Now I might, it's, it'll just, he'll be in the news over and over again. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2247.7200000000003s)]
*  He'll be in the news over and over again, or we'll get the, will LeBron accept a [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2251.2s)]
*  minimum salary to go play for a contender? [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2255.68s)]
*  That'll be two days. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2258.0s)]
*  So yeah, ESPN will be fine for, for, uh, for probably another two weeks. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2259.44s)]
*  Cause what they're not going to do is talk about can OKC go 16 and [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2264.0s)]
*  0 in the playoffs or. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2268.08s)]
*  Sure. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2269.08s)]
*  Well, and meanwhile, here on the ringer, here's another segment [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2269.6s)]
*  about the Boston Celtics. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2272.08s)]
*  You know, we all have counter points. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2273.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great point. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2274.52s)]
*  Uh, but out of all these four series. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2277.04s)]
*  What's the best one? [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2282.16s)]
*  Like we don't know who's coming out of OKC Denver. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2283.7999999999997s)]
*  It's probably gold state, Minnesota, right? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2286.8399999999997s)]
*  If that's, if that becomes the series just from a star power intrigue standpoint. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2288.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, that would be a juicy one. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2293.3599999999997s)]
*  I honestly, like this is maybe an unpopular pick, but I'm actually [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2296.56s)]
*  really excited about Cavs Pacers. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2300.08s)]
*  Uh, I think that's going to be a really fun, really competitive series. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2302.3999999999996s)]
*  Are you with me on don't count the Pacers out for a massive upset corner or no? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2305.72s)]
*  I'm basically always on don't count the Pacers out corner. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2310.0s)]
*  Uh, so yeah, I think that has to be taken into account, but like there has not been [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2313.08s)]
*  a bigger buzzsaw in these playoffs than the Cavs in the first round. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2316.96s)]
*  So I'm eager to see what they get against better competition. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2320.0s)]
*  Of course, I'm eager to see what OKC's got when they have to play someone who's [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2323.0s)]
*  actually going to put up some resistance. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2326.36s)]
*  So honestly, it's been a pretty fun, if a little bit turbulent of a first round. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2327.76s)]
*  Second round is going to have some real juice to it though. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2332.56s)]
*  Indiana's plus 410 in that series. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2336.0s)]
*  And, uh, for the series spread. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2340.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2345.04s)]
*  Cleveland, Cleveland a win in a sweep one, uh, four one or four two. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2345.28s)]
*  That's minus one 88. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2352.48s)]
*  I think the Pacers are going to hang in this series. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2353.88s)]
*  I've been saying it for weeks. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2356.36s)]
*  I really think they have, I think they're really hard to play and I think they [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2358.32s)]
*  really know who they are and they have an identity and, uh, and they're going to be [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2364.1600000000003s)]
*  dangerous. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2367.48s)]
*  I can, I get, I know you already got your Minnesota. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2368.0s)]
*  Lakers thoughts out. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2369.84s)]
*  Can I just tell you how weird it was to go to that game last night and [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2371.08s)]
*  to experience Rudy go bear in person who was awesome. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2374.88s)]
*  Certainly the best game he's ever had, but just to watch the Lakers, not try [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2379.32s)]
*  to solve the problem. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2385.04s)]
*  This is like a, we wouldn't, if we lose this game, we go home and they're just [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2387.6800000000003s)]
*  getting annihilated on the boards and they were just like, even the guys on the [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2392.28s)]
*  court, like they weren't playing a center, but it's, you know, Luca, Luca, it seemed [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2396.96s)]
*  like Luca was on our set healthy, but Rui and LeBron is basically, if they weren't [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2400.2000000000003s)]
*  getting rebounds, guess what? [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2403.52s)]
*  Nobody else is getting a rebound and they're 15 feet from the basket. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2404.52s)]
*  It was, it was one of the weirdest games I've ever been to. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2408.2400000000002s)]
*  I've never seen a team in a must win situation. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2411.0s)]
*  Just let the same thing happen over and over and over again. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2414.88s)]
*  Well, there was the refusal on JJ Reddick's part to put, say Jackson [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2418.52s)]
*  Hayes, whatever big you would prefer on their roster back in the game. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2422.88s)]
*  The corpse of Alex London there, at least like he's taking up space. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2425.6s)]
*  I'm not going to advocate for putting any of those guys in, in particular. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2429.44s)]
*  I'm just saying he refused to do it. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2432.24s)]
*  And yeah, the fact that the players on the court, specifically the forwards, were [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2433.7999999999997s)]
*  just like not putting a body on anybody, including Rudy Gobert, but really anybody [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2436.96s)]
*  at all, just standing there as rebounds came down, like both of those things [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2441.2799999999997s)]
*  can't be true. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2445.12s)]
*  Like one of the sides has to budge. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2445.72s)]
*  Either you put in bigger players or the kind of bigger wings you have have to [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2447.52s)]
*  rebound, but this is the trouble with playing out that. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2451.16s)]
*  They were, they were scrambling and gang rebounding and really being [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2453.6s)]
*  wary of it in this game. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2457.7999999999997s)]
*  They weren't, I thought the Mac, when Maxie Kleber came in, I was with my friend [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2460.2s)]
*  Chen, first of all, I, I honestly didn't know he was on the team. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2463.2799999999997s)]
*  I didn't know like he was dressed for games and he came in and I was like, is [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2467.96s)]
*  that, is that Maxie Kleber, Kleba? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2472.08s)]
*  And then came off the medical table, cleared to play and they're like, yeah, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2476.04s)]
*  okay, here you go. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2479.04s)]
*  Here's five minutes. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2479.72s)]
*  See if you can knock down a shot. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2480.6s)]
*  Minnesota was like, that that's great. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2482.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2484.68s)]
*  Knock yourself out over there. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2485.48s)]
*  We were just like, wow. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2487.04s)]
*  And he was out there in the second half of the game. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2488.96s)]
*  Um, very, very strange. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2491.96s)]
*  Um, going, obviously going back to that Mark Williams trade, not going through, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2494.3199999999997s)]
*  but I don't know where he makes a difference. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2497.8399999999997s)]
*  I just feel like that's a bad matchup for them all the way around. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2499.24s)]
*  Mark Williams thought he made a difference. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2502.52s)]
*  I don't know if you saw him getting on the action, which I appreciate, but I [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2504.12s)]
*  don't think he's changing that game. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2508.2s)]
*  I don't think anybody on their roster, if they had subbed in Alex Lennon or [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2509.44s)]
*  subbed in Jackson, he's, I don't think it's materially changing the fact that [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2512.76s)]
*  Rudy Gobert was putting just about everybody who would get close to him in [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2515.56s)]
*  the rim and nobody would really get close to him by maybe the third quarter at best. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2519.28s)]
*  Well, it was also like such a massive rollover because Minnesota should have [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2524.36s)]
*  won that game by 35 points. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2528.8s)]
*  They couldn't make a three. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2530.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2531.36s)]
*  All the threes were wide open, all of them. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2531.7200000000003s)]
*  And guys weren't like scrambling. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2535.08s)]
*  They weren't like, you know, road. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2536.7200000000003s)]
*  It was just, it was such a weird one. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2538.2s)]
*  And then the way JJ acted, the net 48 hour stretch is like, wow, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2540.04s)]
*  that feels like he's unraveling. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2544.64s)]
*  Um, I thought the whole thing, now you go into this off season, it's like [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2546.7599999999998s)]
*  LeBron's going to be now officially in his forties, you know, um, really [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2550.7999999999997s)]
*  the only move is Reeves. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2556.16s)]
*  That was weird. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2557.16s)]
*  But for Minnesota, um, Minnesota golden state, Minnesota probably has the, the, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2557.64s)]
*  the punchers chance against OKC because of the Edwards piece and the defense. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2563.6800000000003s)]
*  But I, I'm still on Clippers have the best chance to beat OKC Island and [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2568.92s)]
*  they're probably going to lose game seven. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2574.0s)]
*  It's weird like that. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2576.0s)]
*  I think the trouble with Minnesota too, and I like, I'm a believer in the wolves. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2576.92s)]
*  How could you not be after the display? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2580.6800000000003s)]
*  They just put on Julius Randall played unreal. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2582.44s)]
*  Rudy Gobert obviously showed up in the way he did. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2585.1200000000003s)]
*  And Ant has just been developing as a playmaker right before our eyes. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2586.96s)]
*  There's also some stuff happening on the periphery. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2590.88s)]
*  You mentioned the three point shooting where like Nikhil Alexander Walker, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2592.56s)]
*  Loki cannot hit a shot. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2595.16s)]
*  Dante DiVincenzo cannot hit a shot. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2596.56s)]
*  He was awful yesterday. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2598.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2600.0s)]
*  Like that stuff, it either will come home to roost all playoffs long, or it's [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2600.44s)]
*  going to swing back hard the other way. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2604.24s)]
*  And I think that's the question. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2605.84s)]
*  If you're picking the wolves as one, one of the definitive best teams left in the [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2607.0s)]
*  bracket is are you betting on those guys to hit? [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2610.64s)]
*  And I think it's, it's realistic given both of their pedigrees to say that they [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2613.84s)]
*  will, but there's a lot riding on them. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2616.92s)]
*  And, and Jayden McDaniel is also, we should say being dared to shoot yet again. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2619.2s)]
*  And he will be again, just by nature of the way that team is built and he's [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2622.48s)]
*  going to have to knock down some shots in addition to everything else he's doing. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2625.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2628.88s)]
*  The one thing I feel like with Minnesota is when McDaniel's is good, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2629.0s)]
*  they feel almost unbeatable. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2632.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2634.28s)]
*  And he's finding more ways to be good. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2634.84s)]
*  Like he's finding more ways to leverage his size, to get inside, to [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2636.56s)]
*  make plays for other people. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2639.4s)]
*  It's been an awesome Jayden McDaniels back part of the season. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2640.8s)]
*  They hung him on a foul with a minute into the game. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2643.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2645.8s)]
*  It was like, okay, here we go. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2646.44s)]
*  Then he had a second foul. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2647.64s)]
*  I was like, all right, good job. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2648.64s)]
*  You got him out of the game. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2650.36s)]
*  And then he had 40 of the 50 fouls that you mentioned. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2651.48s)]
*  They were calling them on hand checks, which is so funny. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2654.52s)]
*  Like if he had played in that, he would have loved playing in the game. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2657.0s)]
*  I just went to, he would have been clubbing people. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2659.36s)]
*  Um, I think the last point I'll make on Minnesota driving home, I was [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2662.28s)]
*  listening to go bear being interviewed and he was, they asked them like, Hey, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2666.96s)]
*  Edwards was over 10 or for 11. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2669.96s)]
*  Would you, would you think of his game? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2672.1600000000003s)]
*  Because he'd still had an impact on the game. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2674.6800000000003s)]
*  And, and he was like, I don't care if he was over 60. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2676.52s)]
*  He made all the right plays and that's all we want him to do is he made the [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2680.04s)]
*  right decisions, the ball didn't go in, but he was still making the right decisions. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2683.96s)]
*  I thought that was a really good point because I thought last year in the Dallas [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2687.2s)]
*  series, when he got a little discombobulated, then he stopped making the right plays. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2690.2799999999997s)]
*  I always felt like he was doing the right thing or had the right idea. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2696.0s)]
*  Most of the time yesterday, he just couldn't make a shot. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2699.8799999999997s)]
*  And that, that I think is the difference to him last year and this year. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2702.3999999999996s)]
*  I think there was a stretch of maybe three or four positions [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2705.8399999999997s)]
*  where he settled on threes consecutively when the wolves really needed baskets. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2709.04s)]
*  And it was like, he's rocking a little bit off the axis here, but then he [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2713.12s)]
*  stabilized, then they stabilized, then he's, you know, he's getting Julius Randall [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2716.88s)]
*  involved. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2720.32s)]
*  He's making this crucial setup to Mike Conley in the corner for a game securing [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2720.7599999999998s)]
*  basket. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2724.88s)]
*  And also there's also the thing where it's like, when your game plan is so [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2725.2799999999997s)]
*  clearly to work the offensive glass like hell, the shots he was taking are not [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2729.2s)]
*  necessarily bad shots. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2734.4s)]
*  Like sometimes, sometimes his role is to force things so that he doesn't have to [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2735.96s)]
*  call Rudy Gobert up for a high screen. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2739.76s)]
*  So Gobert can stay low and get those rebounds. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2741.48s)]
*  Like there's some trade-offs involved in that, obviously. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2743.6800000000003s)]
*  And you would love, you know, when he gets Luca, an injured Luca one-on-one to [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2746.2000000000003s)]
*  just see him blow by him. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2750.88s)]
*  But the Lakers were doing kind of soft doubles all night. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2751.96s)]
*  They were trying to throw things at him to throw him off balance. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2754.7200000000003s)]
*  And I thought, I thought he mostly aced every test, some occasional blips, but [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2756.8s)]
*  really, really impressive stuff from him. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2761.88s)]
*  Really, really impressive stuff from him. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2763.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2765.3199999999997s)]
*  When you think he's not even in his mid twenties yet, it's pretty good. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2765.4799999999996s)]
*  Well, a lot of good, a lot of good setups. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2770.8399999999997s)]
*  Plus we got a game seven, Rob. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2772.9199999999996s)]
*  So group chats going right after like Sunday morning, right, right after the [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2774.4799999999996s)]
*  game, I assume on Saturday, we'll see, we'll get it up as soon as we can. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2778.56s)]
*  I'm excited to hear it. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2782.7599999999998s)]
*  Rob Mahoney. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2783.8399999999997s)]
*  Thanks for, uh, thanks for popping on. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2784.4399999999996s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2786.16s)]
*  Thanks, Bill. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2786.9199999999996s)]
*  All right. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2788.2799999999997s)]
*  Joanna Robinson is here from the ringer. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2788.68s)]
*  We, uh, we were like basically married to white Lotus for eight weeks together. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2791.7599999999998s)]
*  Eight weeks. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2796.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2797.04s)]
*  Me and Mallory. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2797.36s)]
*  Then we did a couple rewatchables. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2798.4s)]
*  We did can hardly wait. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2800.12s)]
*  We had our first fight. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2801.4s)]
*  A lot of good stuff happened. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2802.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2804.96s)]
*  And then, and then divorce, I guess. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2805.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2807.12s)]
*  It's like a trial separation. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2807.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2808.72s)]
*  So last year was rough for us with television because, um, we had the writer [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2810.04s)]
*  strike, they were moving stuff to 2025 and this year has been a pretty great run, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2814.72s)]
*  especially for like the ringer and for our pods or we had like white Lotus and [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2820.64s)]
*  severance and a bunch of different things. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2824.56s)]
*  And now we're in last of us with this John Ham show. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2826.16s)]
*  We have the studio we have, we found out, I don't know if this is common knowledge [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2829.2s)]
*  or not, but the bear is going to be mid June now. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2833.48s)]
*  So there's shit's going down. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2835.72s)]
*  What's the biggest TV storyline in 2025 to you? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2837.88s)]
*  The biggest TV storyline 2025, I think is that, um, the good IP is actually [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2842.04s)]
*  delivering because I know you didn't mention and, or, and I'm not going to try [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2848.84s)]
*  to make you talk about star wars on this podcast, but and, or is firing on all [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2852.0s)]
*  cylinders, the star wars show. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2856.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2857.92s)]
*  And the last of us is incredible. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2858.2000000000003s)]
*  And so I think, and severance delivered on its second season. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2862.2000000000003s)]
*  So I think all the ways in which we're used to watching this stuff drop off in [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2865.84s)]
*  second seasons after like a big first season, hasn't really been the case this [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2869.2400000000002s)]
*  year so far, and that's been really exciting to know. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2873.52s)]
*  Well, it also feels like the, the whole infrastructure of an episode happens. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2876.4s)]
*  We talk about it. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2882.0s)]
*  We go backwards. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2883.0s)]
*  We go forward to the next one. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2884.0s)]
*  What's going to happen? [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2885.28s)]
*  Oh, new episode. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2886.1600000000003s)]
*  This happened. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2887.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2888.2400000000002s)]
*  It's still fair. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2888.88s)]
*  I was really worried the binge model was going to ruin it. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2889.4s)]
*  And I think it has ruined it in some cases. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2891.84s)]
*  Like your friends and neighbors could easily just, you could have put those [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2894.28s)]
*  all up at once and just had me binge them. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2897.36s)]
*  But for the most part that week to week structure still works. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2899.36s)]
*  I know for us with white Lotus, like we got so much content out of it. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2903.2s)]
*  It was great. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2906.7999999999997s)]
*  It's Apple and HBO and FX are really like holding it down on the week to week [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2907.6s)]
*  front in that way and Paramount as well. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2912.16s)]
*  Um, but yeah, and the binge model, I say this all the time, but yeah, if white [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2914.44s)]
*  Lotus had been a binge drop, or if your friends and neighbors, the show that you [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2918.04s)]
*  texted me the other day was making you giddy was a binge drop, then we wouldn't [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2921.7599999999998s)]
*  get to talk about it for as long as we do and dig into it as deeply as we do. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2924.7599999999998s)]
*  The bear is still a binge drop. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2928.6s)]
*  That's always confusing to me. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2929.96s)]
*  I don't know why that's not a week to week. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2931.2799999999997s)]
*  And Andor, once again, to come back to this, but Andor is dropping on three [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2933.2s)]
*  episode chunks every week, so it's going to be over in two weeks. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2936.3199999999997s)]
*  And that's wild to me for our 12 episode season. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2939.04s)]
*  So it's, it's, it's mixed bag, but I do think that people are finding more and [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2942.0s)]
*  more that if you want your show to, to really take root in the conversation with [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2948.24s)]
*  something like white Lotus, when we're all watching together, when we're [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2953.92s)]
*  speculating together, that's the way you really permeate pop culture in [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2957.04s)]
*  the larger conversation. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2961.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2963.04s)]
*  Um, without even the help of IP white Lotus being sort of like an [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2963.2000000000003s)]
*  original concept from Mike White. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2966.48s)]
*  So, well, there's, so there's three versions of these shows, right? [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2968.0800000000004s)]
*  The first version is like what we went through a white Lotus, what you're [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2971.1600000000003s)]
*  doing now with last of us, you watch it. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2974.2000000000003s)]
*  You probably watch it a second time. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2977.44s)]
*  You prepare all your thoughts and takes, and you really got to dive in. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2979.88s)]
*  Then you wait for the next week. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2983.6800000000003s)]
*  Try to anticipate that's one. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2984.84s)]
*  The second version of that is probably the same thing. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2986.84s)]
*  So maybe you don't need to watch it twice, three times. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2988.8s)]
*  Like for me, land man was like that where I really looked forward to it every [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2990.84s)]
*  week and knew what it was. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2994.1200000000003s)]
*  Then there's that third version. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2995.6000000000004s)]
*  That's a real sweet spot this day and age, which I think your [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2996.92s)]
*  friends and neighbors fits into. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=2999.6400000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3001.2400000000002s)]
*  Tell me about it. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3001.52s)]
*  Tell me why this is a third, which is not deeper than land man for you. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3002.32s)]
*  What is it? [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3007.4s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3008.08s)]
*  Land man was good at this too. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3008.8s)]
*  I don't have to completely pay attention the entire time. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3011.1200000000003s)]
*  I can kind of do something else. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3015.56s)]
*  I, somebody might call and miss five minutes. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3017.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm probably not missing that much. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3020.52s)]
*  It's a show that knows what it is. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3022.12s)]
*  I like hanging out for, for an hour. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3024.0s)]
*  I wouldn't watch it twice. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3026.84s)]
*  Probably would never watch the season again. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3028.64s)]
*  I like, I'm enjoying the hang. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3030.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3032.56s)]
*  It's like, that's like this new version, like a hang show. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3032.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3035.32s)]
*  A good hang show. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3036.04s)]
*  Um, I love to know that you're somewhat second screening it. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3037.64s)]
*  I think what's, I think what's so telling about your friends and neighbors is [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3040.72s)]
*  like, we are covering it on the prestige TV feed, but we're probably only going [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3044.08s)]
*  to drop like 30 minute episodes about it because there isn't like, we're, we're [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3048.56s)]
*  not going to go deep into the metaphors of your friends and neighbors. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3052.4s)]
*  It doesn't have that mean on the bone, but it is fun to talk about. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3055.88s)]
*  There are great performances in there. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3059.48s)]
*  It's fun to look at and it's fun to think about it. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3061.16s)]
*  It's a, it's a real like throwback show. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3063.32s)]
*  We've been comparing it to stuff like weeds, um, you know, or breaking [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3065.64s)]
*  bad and stuff like that. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3069.48s)]
*  And so it's this, it feels like a really vintage kind of show dropping [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3070.52s)]
*  surprisingly in 2025. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3075.44s)]
*  Apple is doing all kinds of surprising things. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3076.84s)]
*  The studio is really, really hitting for me as well. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3079.7200000000003s)]
*  So I want to talk about the studio, but that, yeah, you're right. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3082.1600000000003s)]
*  Your friends and neighbors was probably like a 2012 showtime show. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3084.92s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3089.1200000000003s)]
*  It was definitely a show package with the affair. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3089.7200000000003s)]
*  It's like the affair at nine o'clock and then your friends and neighbors attend [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3092.0s)]
*  the California Cation sort of, yeah. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3095.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3097.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3098.5600000000004s)]
*  It's got the model of a lot of those types of shows where ham is the star. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3099.1200000000003s)]
*  It's then you have like the second star who's like, Oh, I've always liked them. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3103.72s)]
*  In this case, Amanda Pete. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3107.3199999999997s)]
*  It's like, Oh, great to see her again. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3108.64s)]
*  I'm glad she's still in stuff. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3110.8399999999997s)]
*  Um, but for the most part, not it's a cast of, you know, that guys and that [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3112.3599999999997s)]
*  ladies and people are like, I know, I know this person, but from where I [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3116.92s)]
*  can't even remember a huge roster of side characters, I did have a question [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3120.68s)]
*  for you about your friends and neighbors. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3124.12s)]
*  I was curious about when we were talking about it as this kind of throwback show, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3125.72s)]
*  I was remembering that when shows like Homeland or the good wife came out, the [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3129.16s)]
*  result of conversation about the teen characters and how annoying people [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3134.08s)]
*  found the teen characters. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3137.2799999999997s)]
*  How do you think, what do you think about the kids on, on this show [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3138.7599999999998s)]
*  and your friends and neighbors? [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3140.96s)]
*  It's so funny. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3141.92s)]
*  You asked us, I just was talking to somebody about this who works in TV and [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3142.52s)]
*  who had kids around the same age as, as my kids. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3147.88s)]
*  And we're just like, it's just amazing how TV gets this wrong. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3151.04s)]
*  Cause you would figure some of the people that write or run shows have [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3154.2799999999997s)]
*  teenage kids or just had them or are in the middle of having them. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3158.72s)]
*  And they're, I, they just don't get it. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3162.8399999999997s)]
*  They're all kind of like, anytime you have like a female daughter, like a [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3166.2799999999997s)]
*  15 year old daughter character, they're always like super snarky and angry. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3170.2799999999997s)]
*  They have no other dimensions other than that. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3174.4s)]
*  The boys are always like crazy awkward. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3176.56s)]
*  And that's just kind of what they've decided all the teen characters [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3179.44s)]
*  that all these shows should be. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3182.2799999999997s)]
*  And I don't really fully understand it. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3183.72s)]
*  What do you think they should be like? [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3185.6s)]
*  More people that I could see, like, you know, I judge it by the kids [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3187.2400000000002s)]
*  that passed through my house, right? [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3192.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3193.48s)]
*  Like my son, I'll just have four people over randomly and I'm like, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3193.6400000000003s)]
*  Hey, what's that? [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3197.1600000000003s)]
*  Wait, you know, or the same thing when my daughter was living with us in high [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3197.7200000000003s)]
*  school and I don't know, they're just kids. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3200.88s)]
*  I think teens are way more interesting than we see on TV and maybe, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3203.7200000000003s)]
*  maybe they don't know how to write it. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3207.08s)]
*  I mean, I really miss when, uh, as you and I both enjoy, I miss when teens [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3208.56s)]
*  were played by 30 year olds, like on 90210 or the OC. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3212.0s)]
*  Now they're casting actual teenagers and it, it, it highlights even more [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3215.36s)]
*  how they're getting it wrong. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3219.36s)]
*  Cause when they cast 30 year olds, we're all like, we know we're not [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3220.56s)]
*  watching actual teenagers. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3222.96s)]
*  We're watching like an invented fantasy version of a teenager. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3224.4s)]
*  But when you cast an actual teen, I'm like, this doesn't bear any resemblance [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3227.7599999999998s)]
*  to any teen I know in real life. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3231.12s)]
*  Does any show get it right? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3232.52s)]
*  Is anyone getting it right? [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3233.68s)]
*  Well, the funniest is land man. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3234.52s)]
*  Cause I think the lady who plays the teenager is like 29 in real life. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3235.92s)]
*  She is also in 1923 in a completely different role. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3239.72s)]
*  But, um, no one's getting it right. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3243.84s)]
*  You guys like sex life of college girls. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3248.48s)]
*  I thought the youngest, the youngest son on white Lotus, I thought was, I thought [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3250.6800000000003s)]
*  Lockie was a pretty interesting character that had some dimensions. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3255.5600000000004s)]
*  Now he's probably, he was heading to college, right? [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3258.6000000000004s)]
*  He was like a senior. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3260.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3261.7200000000003s)]
*  It's like 19. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3262.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3262.6400000000003s)]
*  18, 19. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3263.1200000000003s)]
*  Well, we were talking about when we did can hardly wait, like how many of [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3264.1200000000003s)]
*  those archetypes they either got wrong or there was way more there stuff they [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3267.1600000000003s)]
*  missed. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3271.6000000000004s)]
*  I just think Hollywood's always had issues with this. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3271.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's true. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3275.04s)]
*  Um, well, I'm glad that, uh, I'm glad to know that you think that Lockie, a [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3275.88s)]
*  character who gave his own brother a hand job on the white Lotus, but it was [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3279.76s)]
*  white Lotus is maybe that part was unusual. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3283.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3287.8s)]
*  But just like a sense of like, I think when, you know, it really depends on [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3288.4s)]
*  the year, but kids are when they're 15, they're trying to be 17, right? [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3292.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3297.2400000000002s)]
*  When they're 17, they can kind of see 19 and 18. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3297.8s)]
*  They can kind of see 19 and 20 in college and they want to be adults, but [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3300.92s)]
*  they're not there yet. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3304.4s)]
*  And it's super awkward. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3305.56s)]
*  And then when they're 19, which is another age that's in these shows a lot, [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3306.36s)]
*  that's when they become a rational confidence adults, like my daughter now [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3311.4s)]
*  who thinks she knows everything and you know, she's like, I know, I don't know. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3314.6s)]
*  And it's like, you don't know anything. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3318.08s)]
*  Um, but it's just, it's weird. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3319.7200000000003s)]
*  They can never nail it. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3321.6800000000003s)]
*  And I think a big part of it is they have tried to zag and cast the people that [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3323.08s)]
*  are more age appropriate. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3328.04s)]
*  Then you're heading into a whole other thing where you don't know if you're [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3329.24s)]
*  getting good actors or not. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3331.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3333.24s)]
*  You know, my favorite thing that TV writers now and probably always have done [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3333.96s)]
*  is, yeah, they did, they did this with like Dylan on 90210 is they give the, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3339.96s)]
*  the team characters their own, the pop culture interests of their generation. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3344.96s)]
*  You know, so like if you watch euphoria and all those kids go to a Halloween [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3350.08s)]
*  costume party and they're all like dressed as, you know, Bas Lerman's Romeo [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3354.44s)]
*  and Juliet or, you know, like just pop culture references that are not other [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3359.08s)]
*  time, no matter how much teens are like obsessed with the nineties right now. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3362.48s)]
*  It's just clear that the writers room are like, this is what we think is cool. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3366.0s)]
*  And the way we code our coolest characters is to give them interest in pop culture [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3369.52s)]
*  from the past. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3375.08s)]
*  And that's, those are the cool characters on your show, like Dylan, et cetera. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3376.0s)]
*  And, uh, I just think, I think that's really funny. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3380.0s)]
*  They're not even trying. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3383.12s)]
*  The Homeland daughter was really when that's the fork in the road for how we [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3384.4s)]
*  did this, but I mean, your friends and neighbors, the best thing is it's [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3389.76s)]
*  basically a John Ham show. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3392.6s)]
*  And if you like John Ham, you're going to like the show. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3394.32s)]
*  And I like John Ham and I support all John Ham projects, but this is like [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3396.48s)]
*  John Ham, just cook. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3400.76s)]
*  You're, you're gonna, you, you ran out all your money. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3401.84s)]
*  Your wife's sleeping with this other guy. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3404.96s)]
*  You're paying, you're paying alimony to her. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3407.56s)]
*  You just got fired for no reason. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3409.92s)]
*  She starts stealing from people. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3412.64s)]
*  You know, I love a heist personally. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3413.88s)]
*  I have a question for you. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3417.4s)]
*  Um, as you know, I'm covering this with Rob Mahoney on the prestige. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3418.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3421.4s)]
*  Uh, NBA, um, you know, expert. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3422.04s)]
*  What do you think of the, of the basketball player on this show? [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3425.12s)]
*  I have some questions. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3428.96s)]
*  I have some thoughts. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3430.28s)]
*  There was a pretty strange party basketball scene they had in one of the [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3431.0s)]
*  episodes that I was like, well, this will never ever in a million years happen. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3435.4s)]
*  But I do, I do think some of the dynamics they have are pretty fun about like the [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3439.32s)]
*  country club dynamics, the paying, paying some sort of private coach, how much [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3444.56s)]
*  should we spend, do we need to get another guy? [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3450.44s)]
*  We've got to get our daughter in a college to play this sport. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3452.7200000000003s)]
*  Like some of that's pretty good. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3455.76s)]
*  And then the dynamics of when you have this big extended circle of friends, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3457.52s)]
*  which I'm certainly I've had different versions of that as I get older, one [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3462.04s)]
*  divorce or separation can be such like a catalyst for conversation, whether [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3466.88s)]
*  they're in the room or not for people. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3472.56s)]
*  How do you bring it up or not? [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3474.88s)]
*  How do you talk about it? [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3476.28s)]
*  Do you take sides? [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3477.4s)]
*  So they've hit some pretty good stuff, but this to me is like a typical Apple [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3478.6400000000003s)]
*  show, it's like the morning show. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3482.04s)]
*  It's just these kind of fun shows that you have to watch kind of one [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3483.92s)]
*  episode of, and you get it. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3487.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3489.44s)]
*  I was thinking about bad monkey, uh, similar, like in that vein and that it's [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3489.6800000000003s)]
*  like, it's such a showcase for Vince Vaughn and then everything else that's [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3493.48s)]
*  happening around him. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3496.36s)]
*  But like, if you love Vince Vaughn, you're going to love bad monkey. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3497.52s)]
*  And if you love John Ham, you're going to love your friends and neighbors. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3499.76s)]
*  And that's kind of the Apple model, right? [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3502.32s)]
*  They, the person to put in the square picture with the title of the show. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3504.1600000000003s)]
*  And you always know who it is, right? [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3508.2400000000002s)]
*  It's like, oh, Vince Vaughn. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3509.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3510.56s)]
*  What's he up to? [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3510.84s)]
*  And sometimes it doesn't work where it's like Billy Crystal. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3512.0s)]
*  He's the psychiatrist that he looks sad. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3515.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3517.56s)]
*  I'm going to stay away. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3517.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3518.96s)]
*  No, thanks. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3519.36s)]
*  But yeah, but then like you, I mean, yeah, the studio is writing a lot on, you [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3520.96s)]
*  know, do you like Seth Rogen? [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3525.72s)]
*  Here's the studio. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3527.04s)]
*  Um, but I think the studio has much, much more on its mind to say about the world [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3528.56s)]
*  is existing in, are you, I, you and Sean and I talked about the studio early [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3534.68s)]
*  this season, how are you enjoying as you now that you see more? [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3538.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, we did the prestige. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3542.12s)]
*  We did the first like, I think, I think three, and I think we were all really [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3543.48s)]
*  interested in it. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3548.7999999999997s)]
*  You guys liked it a little more than I did. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3549.56s)]
*  I thought the energy was definitely a choice and they've kept that energy. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3551.16s)]
*  Every episode. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3555.7599999999998s)]
*  It's really interesting. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3556.9599999999996s)]
*  It's, you know, to me, it's like the rehearsal or some of these other things [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3558.12s)]
*  where people decide creatively we're going for it and you're either going to [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3561.8399999999997s)]
*  be for the ride or you're against it. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3565.8399999999997s)]
*  And they have a lot to say about the studio system, why things are made, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3567.48s)]
*  why choices are made. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3571.48s)]
*  They're trying to satirize and parody everybody at the expense of where [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3572.72s)]
*  sometimes you watch and you're like, Oh, come on, that wouldn't happen. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3577.3999999999996s)]
*  But I don't think they care. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3579.9199999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3581.6s)]
*  So it's a fun hang. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3582.04s)]
*  I, I think the, it seems like the younger generation, like, uh, Craig [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3584.08s)]
*  Horlbeck loves it. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3588.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3590.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3590.44s)]
*  So for there's a certain generation that isn't familiar with the player and some [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3590.7999999999997s)]
*  of the other times that people have made shows like this. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3594.72s)]
*  And so for the first time they're seeing a show like this and they're like, [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3597.4s)]
*  this is great. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3600.96s)]
*  Do you feel like, Oh, you don't even know the player. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3601.64s)]
*  You don't know, you don't know what you're missing. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3603.6s)]
*  Larry Sanders or a lot of these it's dipping and pulling from a lot of things [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3605.0s)]
*  I've already seen. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3609.04s)]
*  So I kind of know, I, like, I'm not, I don't find it that surprising, but I [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3610.52s)]
*  still glad that exists. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3615.04s)]
*  So what, so what do you think? [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3616.48s)]
*  What's been your take through seven episodes? [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3617.4s)]
*  I love it. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3619.7200000000003s)]
*  And there's been moments that I've been really surprised by. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3620.76s)]
*  Like, I think the biggest moment that surprised me was it's not an episode [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3623.32s)]
*  that I loved overall, but the fact that they got Olivia Munn, I'm sorry, Olivia [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3627.52s)]
*  Wilde, Olivia Munn's obviously on your friends and neighbors, Olivia Wilde to [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3631.88s)]
*  sort of parody herself after having been under such scrutiny for her work as a [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3634.84s)]
*  director. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3641.84s)]
*  I thought that was pretty interesting that they had that conversation with her [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3643.0s)]
*  and was like, look, it'll be great for everyone. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3646.1600000000003s)]
*  You'll show that you have a sense of humor about yourself and we'll just go [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3648.2400000000002s)]
*  ahead and do it. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3650.96s)]
*  I think, I think that's always really fun when you can imagine the conversations [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3651.52s)]
*  that they had with the person who's playing themselves and say, look, everyone's [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3655.0800000000004s)]
*  going to really love that you did this, that you, that you know, that you let [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3658.1600000000003s)]
*  them know that, you know what they're all talking about. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3661.8s)]
*  And you showed an even more extreme version of it on screen. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3664.88s)]
*  And that's been the blueprint for all of these things where they are always able [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3668.4s)]
*  to get good cameos that are smartly thought out or it's like, here's this [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3671.6000000000004s)]
*  public perception of you. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3675.44s)]
*  We're going to twist this a certain way and try to use this. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3677.2000000000003s)]
*  So, and this will be a win for you. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3680.28s)]
*  And then usually it is Ron Howard maybe. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3681.84s)]
*  Yeah, it works. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3684.6800000000003s)]
*  But the rest, and I think, I think it's really interesting to think about to [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3687.76s)]
*  point about like the rehearsal or the studio. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3692.6s)]
*  We, I complain all the time, all of us who cover TV complain all the time that [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3695.96s)]
*  there's too much television and there is, there are tons of shows that go on [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3699.36s)]
*  watched unnoticed by people. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3702.72s)]
*  But the advantage of having so much television is that people will, studios [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3705.2s)]
*  will green light something that seems really niche or really odd or really [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3710.52s)]
*  experimental, like the rehearsal and just say, go for it. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3713.36s)]
*  We have the space, we have the time, we have, we think we have the money. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3717.56s)]
*  Now they're realizing they don't have all the money in the world, but we think [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3720.7999999999997s)]
*  we have the money to try this. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3723.3999999999996s)]
*  Let's try it. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3724.48s)]
*  And when it hits, it's extraordinary that something like, like the rehearsal [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3725.3999999999996s)]
*  exists, you know, and you don't get that in the sort of TV landscape that [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3729.12s)]
*  you and I grew up in. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3734.16s)]
*  That's a great point. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3736.0s)]
*  Well, I feel like, you know, I think about the, uh, the studio and what's [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3737.12s)]
*  missing for me, cause I've watched every episode, I look forward to it. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3742.9599999999996s)]
*  I don't always love it, but I'm always, I'm glad it exists. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3746.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3749.68s)]
*  I don't like Seth Brogan's character. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3750.4s)]
*  I don't, I'm not rooting for him. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3752.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3754.52s)]
*  I, I like how he's drawn out. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3755.0s)]
*  Like I get it. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3757.36s)]
*  Like I totally get the character, but you're making him the hero of a show, [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3758.16s)]
*  but he's not a hero, which I think is the point. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3761.84s)]
*  But it's like, I, as some seven episodes in, it's like, am I rooting for this guy [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3764.84s)]
*  to flame out or figure out like, Oh, I can actually use my powers to save [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3770.28s)]
*  Hollywood and maybe the show hasn't figured that out, but they were on this [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3775.28s)]
*  journey with him and I don't know what the journey is and I'm not sure what my [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3778.88s)]
*  role is, my rooting for him or against him. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3781.8s)]
*  I don't know if the show's figured it out. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3784.2000000000003s)]
*  It's funny to hear you describe that because I am rooting for him, but I hear [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3786.2000000000003s)]
*  what you're saying in that he's a doofus. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3789.32s)]
*  He's a, he's like a fuck up, like all this sort of stuff like that. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3791.4s)]
*  So, um, but that's the exact same journey I'm on with your friends and [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3793.76s)]
*  neighbors where I'm watching John Hans character coop and I'm like, am I [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3799.44s)]
*  supposed to like this guy? [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3803.8s)]
*  Am I supposed to be rooting for him? [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3804.88s)]
*  I don't mind the crime. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3806.48s)]
*  I don't mind the BNE. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3807.6400000000003s)]
*  I love a heist, but like, he seems like he was a bad husband and a bad dad. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3808.48s)]
*  And you know, like kind of a callous dude. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3814.2400000000002s)]
*  Am I supposed to be wanting him to succeed or wanting him to get busted? [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3816.96s)]
*  What am I, what am I looking for inside of this show? [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3820.72s)]
*  And that doesn't like, it doesn't have to be someone, a character doesn't have [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3822.76s)]
*  to be someone I'm rooting for. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3827.96s)]
*  They just have to be someone I'm interested in. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3829.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3830.88s)]
*  And so like, if you're interested in what Seth Rogen is doing in the studio, for me, [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3831.48s)]
*  that can carry me beyond whether or not I want him to succeed or not. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3835.84s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3838.84s)]
*  Yeah, I know what you mean. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3839.84s)]
*  I think it's weird. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3841.2000000000003s)]
*  Both shows, even though I think the studio probably put a little more thought into [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3843.44s)]
*  everything it's trying to do than your friends and neighbors, but I think both [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3846.92s)]
*  of them are trying to say something that's not about the main star, right? [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3850.6000000000004s)]
*  The studio is pretty obviously trying to make all of these points about this is [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3853.88s)]
*  why we all complain about Hollywood all the time. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3859.44s)]
*  This is the thought process. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3861.4s)]
*  These are the people that are responsible for the choices of the shows and movies [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3862.68s)]
*  that make you mad when you don't understand why there's not more good stuff. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3866.8799999999997s)]
*  This is why you're seeing all of it right now. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3870.24s)]
*  So I get that. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3872.6s)]
*  These are the people who don't know how to write teenagers on your favorite [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3873.24s)]
*  TV show. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3876.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3876.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3877.4s)]
*  Your friends and neighbors, I think is way less interested in the John Han piece [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3878.2799999999997s)]
*  and more interested in this whole culture of wealthy people, their relationship with [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3883.24s)]
*  one another, their possessions and the fact that they have stuff and they don't [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3889.12s)]
*  even realize stuff's gone when they're just collecting things that I don't know [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3893.92s)]
*  what it is. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3897.96s)]
*  They have a basketball court. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3898.48s)]
*  They don't use it. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3899.72s)]
*  They want their daughter to play tennis because it'll get her into college and [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3901.48s)]
*  then it'd be a good thing for them, not for the daughter. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3906.08s)]
*  And so it's, it's, it's hitting this like, why are the choices that all these [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3908.6s)]
*  wealthy people making? [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3913.96s)]
*  What's the point of them that I actually think is a really interesting [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3915.68s)]
*  concept? [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3918.88s)]
*  Well, I think it's interesting to watch your friends and neighbors right off the [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3919.84s)]
*  heels of white Lotus, which is also a show that, that tries to look at rich [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3922.88s)]
*  people and Hey man, they also have problems. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3928.44s)]
*  They're not happy even though they're surrounded by all this luxury. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3931.2400000000002s)]
*  Um, but I think it's, um, except for Greg Gary, he didn't have problems. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3934.48s)]
*  He's figured it out. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3939.0s)]
*  He has a great house and he knows what he likes sexually. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3940.08s)]
*  He's good. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3942.4s)]
*  But I think both those shows are trying to have it both ways, both ways where [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3943.1600000000003s)]
*  they're critiquing that class of person while also inviting you to, to [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3946.2s)]
*  luxuriate in this world and just have this sort of escapist fantasy that you too [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3953.64s)]
*  can have a watch that costs this much money or, you know, a swimming pool that [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3959.3199999999997s)]
*  looks like this or a catered birthday party that looks like that, you know, [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3963.3599999999997s)]
*  like that. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3967.48s)]
*  Or a show of watches. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3968.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3970.12s)]
*  It's like, here are all my luxury watches one by one. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3970.3199999999997s)]
*  Do you have a watch shelf though? [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3973.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3974.8s)]
*  100% no. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3976.0s)]
*  Um, I don't know, man. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3980.0s)]
*  Is there, is there anything on your friends and neighbors that you saw that [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3981.36s)]
*  you're like, yeah, I should, I should do that. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3983.7200000000003s)]
*  That's something I should do. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3985.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean, when they went to the guy's little private basketball court, I was [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3987.48s)]
*  like, ah, that's not, that's pretty impressive. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3990.92s)]
*  Little indoor court out of nowhere. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3992.6000000000004s)]
*  Uh, some of the, uh, the, the part they maybe don't hit hard enough, especially [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=3994.8s)]
*  with older parents is how drunk people get. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4001.6800000000003s)]
*  I think they've gotten in a little bit, but it's definitely something you see [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4005.28s)]
*  when, when people have like the kids go to college and it's just like the couple [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4009.7200000000003s)]
*  left, like people getting like hammered. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4013.52s)]
*  Uh, it's like this whole, that's what I've never seen in these shows in the [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4017.1600000000003s)]
*  right way where it's like, Whoa, they can't even walk and they're 54. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4021.6000000000004s)]
*  The more you talk about this bill, the more I want you to make this show. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4027.6000000000004s)]
*  I want you to make this show. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4030.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4032.3599999999997s)]
*  I want you to make the show where you get the teenage characters, right. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4032.68s)]
*  And show what the empty, the like the well-to-do empty nesters do once [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4035.48s)]
*  their kids are off to college. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4039.12s)]
*  I think it's everybody. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4041.48s)]
*  You, you, if you're building like your whole life around work and your kids, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4042.4399999999996s)]
*  and then the kids just go, some people, first of all, you better really [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4047.68s)]
*  like who you're married to, which I'm fortunate enough. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4051.72s)]
*  I really enjoyed my wife's company still, but you better really [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4053.6s)]
*  like whoever you're married to. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4056.56s)]
*  And you better be prepared for like, guess what? [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4058.9199999999996s)]
*  There's going to be a moment when your kids don't really want to hang out [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4061.76s)]
*  with you and they're just going to leave and they're going to go and [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4064.6000000000004s)]
*  then she's going to be you guys. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4066.44s)]

*  Um, all right. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4072.6400000000003s)]
*  Uh, wait, can we talk about last of us? [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4073.36s)]
*  Sure. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4075.7200000000003s)]
*  What do you want to say? [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4076.5600000000004s)]
*  I don't watch that show. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4077.44s)]
*  I know you don't. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4078.48s)]
*  I know. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4079.76s)]
*  Are you having any, are you having FOMO given that the last of us in [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4080.0s)]
*  Andor is, are dominating at least a lot of the conversations we're [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4084.0400000000004s)]
*  having at the ringer is that something like, do you, does it bum you out [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4087.6000000000004s)]
*  to not be watching these shows? [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4091.04s)]
*  Or how do you feel? [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4092.08s)]
*  I, I don't, I think I'm going to watch last of us at some point. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4094.88s)]
*  Really? [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4098.36s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4099.36s)]
*  And then by the way, I watched the first five episodes. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4100.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4103.56s)]
*  I just wasn't for me, those bleak end of the world type things. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4104.24s)]
*  Like you really kind of have to be in the mood in that. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4108.64s)]
*  And you know, post, post COVID, I wasn't really that interested to [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4110.68s)]
*  explore the end of the world, but maybe I'll get there in the late 2020s. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4115.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4119.5199999999995s)]
*  Um, and, or something like that's one where I think you really have to. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4120.68s)]
*  Buy into the star Wars universe. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4125.68s)]
*  And I think it becomes more meaningful, right? [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4127.52s)]
*  I just couldn't step into Andor unless I had some background, right? [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4129.44s)]
*  To a certain degree. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4133.36s)]
*  But I think, you know, when you listen to Chris and Andy talk about it on the [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4134.52s)]
*  watch, you know, uh, they have been so disillusioned with star Wars. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4137.36s)]
*  Uh, they might've grown up on star Wars, but they've been so disillusioned [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4142.28s)]
*  with, with like what's going on in that, in that world and what Tony [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4144.84s)]
*  Gilroy is doing with Andor is just like making a really complex show about [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4149.36s)]
*  politics and spy craft and all this sort of stuff, and with like this. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4155.96s)]
*  Barely visible veneer of star Wars on top of it. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4159.799999999999s)]
*  So I actually think you could watch and enjoy. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4163.799999999999s)]
*  I should just watch the first one and see what I think. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4166.719999999999s)]
*  I mean, the problem is I'm just on these terrible channels, like [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4169.92s)]
*  to be in Pluto and just like, Oh, death wish is on. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4173.4s)]
*  And I'm just watching some movie from 50 years ago over. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4176.36s)]
*  Do you pull up Pluto because it is comforting to see the old [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4179.2s)]
*  like grid of what's on the grid? [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4183.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4185.44s)]
*  I love the grid. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4185.68s)]
*  I still have cable too. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4186.12s)]
*  Same thing. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4187.08s)]
*  I'll zip through the movie channels and yeah. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4187.5599999999995s)]
*  Uh, yeah. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4189.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4191.2s)]
*  To be main screens. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4191.44s)]
*  Great. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4192.599999999999s)]
*  Um, I like what Amazon will get frisky sometimes with like 90s classics [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4193.24s)]
*  or two thousands movies you haven't seen. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4197.84s)]
*  I like, I like having my handheld. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4199.8s)]
*  So you're happy with the last of us. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4201.84s)]
*  I know you're covering it all over the place. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4203.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4205.28s)]
*  I mean, can we spoil the big thing that has happened this season [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4205.76s)]
*  that everyone already knows about? [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4209.400000000001s)]
*  I feel like at this point, everybody knows, right? [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4211.4800000000005s)]
*  How would you hide from that one? [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4213.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4215.08s)]
*  So they kill off the main character. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4215.68s)]
*  So Petra Pascal is not on the show anymore. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4217.320000000001s)]
*  Looking at, at it from the outside in, like, what is, are you, do you [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4220.76s)]
*  have any reactions to that? [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4225.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I was, I was startled because they did one of those things that we've gotten [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4227.24s)]
*  used to during the social media era of huge surprise, you know, and you see those. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4232.52s)]
*  On the last of us. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4239.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4240.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4241.200000000001s)]
*  So, you know, something happened, but then it just was persistent. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4241.4800000000005s)]
*  And then the next day, of course, it's on like Apple news on my phone, like [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4244.8s)]
*  why Pedro Pascal left the last of us. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4248.52s)]
*  And they straight true to the video game. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4250.84s)]
*  And so obviously even me who doesn't didn't watch the show knew that he wasn't on. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4252.88s)]
*  So, but so it stayed true to the video game, right? [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4258.040000000001s)]
*  Or no. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4260.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that, that happens in the there's the, there was like a first edition of the [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4260.92s)]
*  video game and then a sequel to the video game. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4265.4800000000005s)]
*  And in the sequel, they kill off that character right at the beginning of the game. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4267.04s)]
*  So they killed him off. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4270.12s)]
*  And we were all wondering if they would string it along just to keep their star, [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4271.08s)]
*  the Petra Pascal on the show a little longer, but they killed him in the second [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4276.84s)]
*  episode of the season. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4280.04s)]
*  But I was just curious if, if, if that kind of move is something that makes you want [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4281.04s)]
*  to watch the show more, if you're like, oh, they're doing something as bold as that. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4284.6s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4288.88s)]
*  I kind of want to check that kind of storytelling out. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4289.56s)]
*  Or if you're like, cause we've heard, seems risky. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4292.160000000001s)]
*  Well, there's been this interesting, there's been a reaction of if Peter [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4295.280000000001s)]
*  Pascal is not on the show, I don't want to watch the show anymore. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4299.84s)]
*  And I, I have to say, I got a little like bored with that because I've just [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4303.72s)]
*  heard it before and those people don't ever wind up quitting the shows. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4309.4400000000005s)]
*  I've just heard it for too often that people are like, I'm quitting. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4312.96s)]
*  I'm never going to watch the show again. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4316.120000000001s)]
*  We heard on game of Thrones every other season, people would say that [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4317.32s)]
*  in reaction to something and then more and more people watched it every, every [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4320.16s)]
*  year. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4324.48s)]
*  Walking dead was the best example of that. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4325.0s)]
*  The first couple of years when it was really a water cooler show and they [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4326.599999999999s)]
*  would kill off a couple of people and be like, what? [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4329.5199999999995s)]
*  How I'm now I'm quitting. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4333.16s)]
*  I'm never coming back. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4334.36s)]
*  And then they always do. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4335.12s)]
*  So I'm just like, it's not, I can't believe what's the number one. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4335.84s)]
*  I can't believe they killed that off that person off characters. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4340.24s)]
*  It's gotta be the, the guy in game of Thrones, right? [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4343.24s)]
*  Sean Bean. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4346.16s)]
*  Sean Beans. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4347.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4347.72s)]
*  Just like that. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4348.280000000001s)]
*  They did that. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4349.04s)]
*  And everyone who read the books knew it was coming, but for somebody like me, it [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4349.76s)]
*  was like, I thought that was the star of the show. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4353.68s)]
*  It was like, wait, what? [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4357.08s)]
*  How do you do that? [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4358.6s)]
*  Given your allergy to genre storytelling, Bill, how did you wind up watching game [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4359.8s)]
*  of Thrones in its very first season? [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4365.88s)]
*  What? [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4367.76s)]
*  Because it was, I didn't watch it. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4368.4400000000005s)]
*  I didn't. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4369.88s)]
*  I came in late and a couple of people in, it was the then grant [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4370.320000000001s)]
*  man universe, just hammering me. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4376.68s)]
*  But it got to the point where it was clearly such a great show and such a [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4380.0s)]
*  phenomenon that it was like, if I like TV, how do I not watch this? [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4384.0s)]
*  It was one of those. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4389.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4390.4800000000005s)]
*  And I'm trying to decide which like between the last of us and Andor, which [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4391.360000000001s)]
*  one I want to sort of, uh, bug you about for the next five years to see if I can [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4394.6s)]
*  get you to watch it, probably the biggest hole, my worst one that I'm your worst [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4400.4400000000005s)]
*  one is Sopranos. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4405.200000000001s)]
*  Clearly. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4406.44s)]
*  My worst one is probably six feet under. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4407.5599999999995s)]
*  I've never seen it. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4410.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4411.4s)]
*  I've never watched it. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4411.68s)]
*  That is wild to me. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4413.48s)]
*  Not just because it's a bad job at me. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4414.48s)]
*  No, it's just, it's such a bill show. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4416.5199999999995s)]
*  I know it's like a show you would really like. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4418.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4420.639999999999s)]
*  Explain it. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4420.88s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4421.5599999999995s)]
*  That's okay. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4422.04s)]
*  We all have those things. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4422.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4423.5199999999995s)]
*  That's one that I know I have in my back pocket. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4423.72s)]
*  I never watched the shield, which has enraged a couple of people in my life, but [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4425.96s)]
*  now I feel like that's probably too dated. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4430.04s)]
*  No, I mean, the shield and the leftovers is the other one that I, that's a miss [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4432.12s)]
*  for me. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4435.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4436.56s)]
*  But I like the leftovers isn't a bill show, but like shield and six feet under. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4436.76s)]
*  Well, yeah, Carrie's in it, but you can see her in other things, right? [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4441.88s)]
*  I know, but I thought I'd have to support the Carrie coon franchise. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4444.76s)]
*  I was watching, I was watching flipping channels and eagle. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4449.92s)]
*  I was on with Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monahan, Michelle Monahan. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4453.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4457.6s)]
*  Much, much younger because it came out 20 years ago and I was like, wow, [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4458.08s)]
*  there's our girl. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4462.400000000001s)]
*  She's back. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4463.12s)]
*  If I still feel like attachments to all the characters, although it seems like our [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4464.12s)]
*  guy, Walton Goggins is kind of unraveling a little bit. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4468.32s)]
*  I have a lot of questions, Bill and no answers for you. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4471.16s)]
*  Just only people go on white Lotus and weird shit happens after they lose their [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4473.56s)]
*  marbles. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4477.4800000000005s)]
*  It's a lot. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4478.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4478.72s)]
*  We, we support Walton Goggins always on this podcast and all podcasts, but I just [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4479.28s)]
*  have some questions about what's happening. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4483.2s)]
*  I do have some intel. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4485.28s)]
*  I don't think they're going cold in season four. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4486.24s)]
*  What? [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4489.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4490.92s)]
*  I tried to warn you with this. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4491.28s)]
*  I don't think Mike whitelegs cold. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4492.68s)]
*  Okay. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4494.4400000000005s)]
*  Do you know where we're going? [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4495.52s)]
*  I don't know where we're going and I don't think they know where they're going, [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4497.200000000001s)]
*  but I don't think it's going to be cold. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4499.4800000000005s)]
*  Somewhere sunny. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4501.240000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4502.200000000001s)]
*  You're not going to get this Swiss Alps. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4502.52s)]
*  We're not getting Aspen. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4505.0s)]
*  We're not getting anything with snow. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4506.240000000001s)]
*  I don't think. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4508.04s)]
*  What's the next show this year that you're excited about? [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4509.280000000001s)]
*  What's coming up that you, the bear, the bear. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4511.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4515.280000000001s)]
*  And how do you watch the bear? [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4515.6s)]
*  Um, I can't. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4518.4400000000005s)]
*  I, so here's the thing with the bear. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4519.88s)]
*  I can't do more than two. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4521.92s)]
*  I think that's how you have to treat it. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4524.84s)]
*  And I think people who binge, you try to watch like five in one night. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4526.76s)]
*  That's not the show. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4530.2s)]
*  You can't do it. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4530.96s)]
*  You're doing the show to service. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4531.679999999999s)]
*  That's not how it was meant to be written, perceived, consumed anything. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4533.08s)]
*  But would you do two over the course of a week, like Monday through Friday, [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4538.72s)]
*  every night we're watching two, or do you do two and space it out a couple [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4541.4s)]
*  of days and two more? [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4544.639999999999s)]
*  And so I'm saying I would watch two in a row. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4545.679999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4547.639999999999s)]
*  But I'm saying like Monday night, two episodes Tuesday night, the next two [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4547.96s)]
*  episodes Wednesday night, sort of like that, or the problem with binge shows [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4551.32s)]
*  like that though, is you don't want to be too far behind what everyone's talking [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4555.4s)]
*  about in case you get spoiled or something like that, you know? [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4558.52s)]
*  If I was in charge of FX, I would run one on Sunday night and run out and [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4561.88s)]
*  one on Wednesday night. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4565.36s)]
*  Now do a Sunday, Wednesday, a staggered schedule so people could talk about each [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4566.44s)]
*  one, but then the next one's coming. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4570.16s)]
*  And that's, I just think that would work better. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4571.56s)]
*  I told you where they started binge, like the bears, a binge watch, right? [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4573.4s)]
*  It was to ignite Hulu, wasn't it? [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4577.24s)]
*  No. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4579.72s)]
*  Well, I was told that it was because, um, John Landgraf thought it was like too [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4580.2s)]
*  bleak and that people wouldn't stick with it if it were week to week. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4585.2s)]
*  So I understand why they dropped the first season as a binge, but once they [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4590.84s)]
*  saw what a hit it was, I will never understand why they keep dropping it as a binge. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4595.4s)]
*  I think it's just because they think people expect it at this point, but I [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4599.52s)]
*  don't know why you wouldn't just reverse course and own the summer with the bear, [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4603.12s)]
*  which you could easily do. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4607.0s)]
*  So I can tell you this would have been great for a great land and it would have [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4608.2s)]
*  been great for the ringer and it would have been great for any content. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4611.76s)]
*  Hope they'll ever be involved with. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4615.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4616.72s)]
*  Think of the content on the watch. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4617.0s)]
*  Um, a great podcast on your network. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4619.92s)]
*  Um, Chris and Andy interviewed Tony Gilroy about Andor, and he was talking [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4623.04s)]
*  about the released schedule and he was saying, dropping three episodes a week. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4626.84s)]
*  He's like, I kind of like it. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4631.0s)]
*  It's like a little movie every week, you know, so people can watch it. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4632.12s)]
*  He was like, I do worry about the podcasters and he sounded actually genuine. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4635.68s)]
*  He was like, it's a lot for the podcasters to try to cover. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4640.24s)]
*  And I was like, thanks Tony Gilroy for thinking about us. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4642.96s)]
*  Well, stranger things was the other one that just doesn't care. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4645.76s)]
*  And that's coming too. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4648.68s)]
*  I think this summer, right? [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4649.64s)]
*  Uh, yeah. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4651.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4652.2s)]
*  I think like mid summer, July, something like that. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4652.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4655.2s)]
*  The one I'm the most excited about and God knows it'll ever when it'll ever [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4655.68s)]
*  finish and it probably won't be 25 is, uh, is when they figure out euphoria, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4659.5199999999995s)]
*  especially if they do the moving the characters forward by five years gimmick, [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4663.959999999999s)]
*  which it sounds like they did. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4667.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4668.959999999999s)]
*  I just, I've always wanted somebody to do that. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4669.4s)]
*  I think. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4671.679999999999s)]
*  What did like Dawson's Creek do that or some one tree Hill? [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4672.759999999999s)]
*  One of those shows advanced, the characters got old and they just said, [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4677.16s)]
*  fuck it and moved everybody forward. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4681.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that sounds like a one tree Hill move. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4683.679999999999s)]
*  Dawson's never did that. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4685.4s)]
*  We had to suffer through all the years of college. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4686.28s)]
*  Well, at the finale, finale of Dawson's, they did a time hump. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4688.6s)]
*  Well, the best time hump of all time is Mallory's favorite moment in that [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4693.120000000001s)]
*  history of television, which was the end of the affair with old Dominic West [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4697.4800000000005s)]
*  with the, with the old age makeup that she's never been more delighted about [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4704.64s)]
*  anything that's ever happened. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4708.52s)]
*  I genuinely think you two think of the affairs. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4709.76s)]
*  One of the greatest things that ever happened on television. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4713.160000000001s)]
*  It's one of our bonds. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4715.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4716.76s)]
*  It's we've the first season I would stand by the lore of everything behind [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4717.16s)]
*  the show, behind the seats of the show. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4722.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4724.04s)]
*  That just became, that would be the greatest oral history. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4724.6s)]
*  No pun intended. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4727.44s)]
*  I think that's ever been written about a TV show. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4728.36s)]
*  I still don't really know what happened. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4731.72s)]
*  Euphoria would be a pretty good one too, but. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4733.5199999999995s)]
*  I love that Mallory's not here and you're just sort of like filling in for her. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4735.92s)]
*  I appreciate you. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4738.8s)]
*  I'm just, yeah, I'm just taking some of her takes. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4739.5599999999995s)]
*  I know she would appreciate it too. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4741.76s)]
*  What show are you the most excited about in 25 that hasn't come out yet? [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4743.36s)]
*  Um, well, we got another throne show coming up and out of the seven kingdoms. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4747.12s)]
*  We just don't know when it's coming. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4750.28s)]
*  We thought it was coming after the last of us, but they haven't even announced a [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4751.5599999999995s)]
*  date yet, so I don't know when that's going to happen, but, uh, I'm really, [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4755.5199999999995s)]
*  really excited for that one to podcast about it with Mallory and Chris. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4759.84s)]
*  I think it's going to be really fun. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4762.72s)]
*  So that one should be good. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4763.88s)]
*  Um, there's a, there's a new show from the creator of Mary of East town. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4766.68s)]
*  That's going to chill. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4772.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4773.72s)]
*  That's going to be a really good one. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4774.28s)]
*  I think. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4776.04s)]
*  So, you know, there's, there's a lot to think about in terms of what we want from [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4776.5599999999995s)]
*  television going forward, because television is radically changing in terms [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4784.0s)]
*  of how they're making it and what exactly they're making. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4786.919999999999s)]
*  And so I think, you know, the more that people can make it clear in terms of [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4789.5599999999995s)]
*  conversation or engaging what actually hits and what they're not actually watching. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4795.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, your friends and neighbors, you're saying you're watching like 80% of it. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4801.08s)]
*  Is that what you said to me? [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4804.44s)]
*  Something like that. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4805.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4806.44s)]
*  It's I wish there was some way to keep like how they have. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4806.679999999999s)]
*  Or rings and Apple watches. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4810.04s)]
*  Wait, where your eyeballs go during a TV show. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4811.719999999999s)]
*  It's like, is it like a 72% I'm looking at the TV during it? [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4814.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4818.599999999999s)]
*  Is it an 80? [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4819.16s)]
*  Are we at 30? [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4820.2s)]
*  Where are we? [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4821.32s)]
*  So that's a hang show for you. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4822.36s)]
*  That's just sort of like a background watching show for you, but with white [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4823.5599999999995s)]
*  Lotus, you were, you were sat and you were taking notes and you were ready for it. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4826.92s)]
*  You know, in 1923, which I really, really, really enjoyed. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4831.04s)]
*  Uh, and is a big show for me and my wife. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4835.08s)]
*  Like, I think we, there's very few shows we equally like, like the same percentage. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4837.400000000001s)]
*  And that white Lotus was another one, but 1923 seems like it's a hang show, but. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4843.56s)]
*  You actually like, you're popping your head up a lot on that one. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4849.04s)]
*  What is a lot going on? [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4853.72s)]
*  And I thought the actors were really good on this season. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4854.72s)]
*  I thought the, the wife character who, um, is trying to get back with her husband. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4857.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4861.280000000001s)]
*  And she was excellent. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4862.2s)]
*  I thought she was an excellent actress. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4864.36s)]
*  She's great. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4866.28s)]
*  What do you think of the rumors that the guy who plays her husband, Brendan [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4866.88s)]
*  Stener, that he might be Batman? [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4870.48s)]
*  What do you think of that rumor? [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4872.2s)]
*  Would you like it? [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4873.12s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4874.5199999999995s)]
*  I know he has some Sydney Sweeney movie coming, right? [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4875.2s)]
*  Like he fit and he has, she's in a movie with the lady from white Lotus that I [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4878.12s)]
*  think already might've come out. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4882.36s)]
*  The girl from season two. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4884.24s)]
*  Um, that one already came out. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4886.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4888.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4889.44s)]
*  So I think they're trying to make them a thing. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4889.679999999999s)]
*  Him as Batman though. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4891.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4892.32s)]
*  I mean, the one thing with him is I do feel like he's winning fights on 1923. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4893.0s)]
*  It's like, don't fuck with it. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4896.68s)]
*  Like he has that kind of energy to him that I think works. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4897.6s)]
*  He threw that one guy overboard. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4901.4800000000005s)]
*  Like, you know, so, uh, I mean, I think that would be really interesting. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4903.320000000001s)]
*  Oh, one or two other shows. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4908.0s)]
*  We didn't mention before we go. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4909.320000000001s)]
*  Paradise was totally watchable. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4910.64s)]
*  I thought that was probably a 72, maybe a 67 on my eyeball scale. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4912.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4917.4400000000005s)]
*  Definitely could like, could like go on eBay and look for stuff and just pop up. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4917.72s)]
*  And then I didn't watch it. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4922.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm going to, but the pit I think was the unexpected surprise hit of the year. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4924.04s)]
*  Right? [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4928.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4928.6s)]
*  But the pit is not a paradise background watchable. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4928.72s)]
*  The pit is just like it. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4933.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4936.0s)]
*  I think the pit is definitely, uh, I think Andor just for what I like is the [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4936.64s)]
*  number one show of the year for me. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4942.24s)]
*  Um, and, uh, it's just operating on a different level altogether, but the pit [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4944.4800000000005s)]
*  in terms of similar to your friends and neighbors, it feels like a [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4949.32s)]
*  show from a different era. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4952.2s)]
*  Uh, we feel like we're just watching ER and elevated ER. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4953.759999999999s)]
*  And, uh, [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4957.36s)]
*  Elevated ER is a great idea. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4959.08s)]
*  I would have bought that one in the room. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4960.96s)]
*  I would have done the best part of the pit. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4962.5199999999995s)]
*  Not just that it ran longer than your normal HBO show runs. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4965.88s)]
*  So you're just like really with the characters week to week for awhile, but [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4969.84s)]
*  it's coming back at the top of next year. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4973.84s)]
*  Like we don't have to wait three years for another season. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4976.32s)]
*  They're bringing it back at the same time next year. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4979.04s)]
*  And so, you know, that's how we used to watch television, but yeah, the [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4981.08s)]
*  pit is, I mean, absolutely killer. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4984.4s)]
*  I can't wait for you to watch the pit. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4986.84s)]
*  I can't wait to hear your pit takes. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4988.12s)]
*  I'll be banging. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4989.24s)]
*  Once we get through NBA playoffs, when we hit like mid-June, I'm just, that's it. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4989.84s)]
*  I will be all caught up on all TV by probably mid, mid late July. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=4995.84s)]
*  So what I'm hearing, uh, though, is that you want to podcast about [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5000.0s)]
*  Euphoria season three with me. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5004.8s)]
*  That's what, that's what our plan is for. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5006.48s)]
*  Am I, I think I'm too old to be in that podcast, but no, we're, we're. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5008.599999999999s)]
*  Well, first of all, I don't want to jinx it. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5012.759999999999s)]
*  Cause God only knows with all the people involved in that show, if we ever get [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5014.679999999999s)]
*  to the end of a season three filming, but they are filming it. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5018.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5021.5199999999995s)]
*  So that's a win. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5022.16s)]
*  I believe I choose to believe. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5023.24s)]
*  The one I'd want to do with you is, um, like the five year [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5025.36s)]
*  anniversary of the idol. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5028.839999999999s)]
*  Oh, diving back in and trying to figure out exactly what happened. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5030.759999999999s)]
*  Is that my punishment for not having seen the Sopranos? [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5036.04s)]
*  You're going to make me watch the idol five years later. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5038.32s)]
*  What happened? [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5041.16s)]
*  I actually don't feel like enough's been made out of them postponing the biggest [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5043.0s)]
*  phenomenon show that they had since. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5047.44s)]
*  Basically not a non game of Thrones. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5050.32s)]
*  Like just an absolute phenomenon that's peaking on Tik TOK. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5052.2s)]
*  And instead of doing season three, the guy's like, can I do this other idea [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5056.44s)]
*  first, and then it just becomes this two and a half year shit show, however long [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5059.679999999999s)]
*  it took, and then it was so bad. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5064.0s)]
*  They had to basically combine episodes to get out of the season. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5066.16s)]
*  Like, what are the odds? [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5069.4s)]
*  That was a brush fire. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5071.08s)]
*  That was terrible. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5072.28s)]
*  That was, that was, it couldn't have been worse. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5073.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5075.44s)]
*  Uh, okay. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5075.92s)]
*  Five years later, the idol, what happened? [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5076.5599999999995s)]
*  What, what happened and why? [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5078.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5081.4s)]

*  We were basically like, we were holding on to the side of the cliff, hoping for [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5090.76s)]
*  good shows and then boom, we've had, we're having a really good year. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5094.68s)]

*  Thanks for coming out. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5101.84s)]
*  We're taping this. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5103.8s)]
*  Uh, it is Thursday morning. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5104.84s)]
*  There's so many storylines in play, big picture that I had to bring the guy who's [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5106.16s)]
*  seen it all, Bob Ryan, who, uh, is the best ever at comparing players, different [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5111.08s)]
*  eras he's seen everything. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5116.68s)]
*  Um, what guy do you want to start with? [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5118.64s)]
*  Because I really want your big picture context on some of this stuff. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5120.96s)]
*  If you want to go Anthony Edwards, age 23, taking it to the Lakers, taking [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5123.88s)]
*  down Durant last year, taking down Luke and LeBron this year, what do you see with him? [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5128.24s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5133.4400000000005s)]
*  There was a point in the middle of the season when I, uh, in fact, I don't even [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5133.96s)]
*  know if Twitter had turned to X yet, but I either Twitter tweeted or X'd that [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5139.12s)]
*  he's got some Michael Jordan in him. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5143.88s)]
*  And then next thing you know, I saw that somebody of, you know, in real [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5146.76s)]
*  consequence saying the same thing made me feel very good. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5151.88s)]
*  He does have Michael Jordan in him. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5155.6s)]
*  There's Michael Jordan-esque qualities in his game. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5158.12s)]
*  Same size, body type, range of skill, uh, swagger. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5160.88s)]
*  He's got swagger, God knows. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5165.56s)]
*  Uh, and you know, we took, he got everyone's attention last year in the [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5167.68s)]
*  world games, you know, we lost, he was the best player on the team. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5171.08s)]
*  Now it was news to a lot of us that he would be the best player on that team. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5174.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5177.68s)]
*  And, uh, and he's built on that and he's, he's a growth stock. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5177.8s)]
*  My God, you know, they've got something very special there. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5182.04s)]
*  So yeah, he's gotten my attention. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5184.8s)]
*  Um, you got that. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5186.56s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5187.72s)]
*  Can I say on Edwards? [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5187.88s)]
*  So world games was two years ago and then last year was the big playoff run [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5189.4800000000005s)]
*  Olympics where, no, I'm just getting the chronology right. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5193.64s)]
*  When he, when he- [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5197.24s)]
*  But that's where he got my first, first got my, now I was aware of him at Georgia [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5199.52s)]
*  and I knew people that thought he was very talented, but, but there was something [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5203.0s)]
*  missing, but whatever was missing, doesn't, he appears to have found it. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5207.72s)]
*  Well, you think last year versus this year, last year was the, Whoa, [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5211.92s)]
*  Anthony Edwards, he's here. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5215.72s)]
*  I can't believe it. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5217.16s)]
*  I didn't realize he was like, Whoa, there's a little Michael Jordan here [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5218.72s)]
*  this year, even though he sucked in the, he sucked in the closeout game last night. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5221.68s)]
*  He couldn't make a three, but, um, Rudy Gobert said something interesting after [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5225.08s)]
*  that I agreed with, cause I went to the game, he made all the right plays. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5229.28s)]
*  Like he wasn't making the threes, but they were the right threes to take. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5233.4s)]
*  He, they kept sending these doubles staggered doubles at him. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5236.88s)]
*  He usually was making the right decisions. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5239.96s)]
*  And the truth is if they had made some threes, they would have won by, by 30. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5242.400000000001s)]
*  But I'm with you. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5246.4800000000005s)]
*  Like I didn't go to the famous game. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5247.320000000001s)]
*  I know you did the 63 point game that MJ had, and I hate comparing anyone to MJ. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5249.56s)]
*  He's the best part I've ever seen, but there are pieces and it's undeniable. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5254.08s)]
*  And you see it in person where you're like, ah, that kind of just the way he's [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5258.52s)]
*  carrying himself, the way he's easily going by people, the way he easily seems [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5262.04s)]
*  like he's the best athlete in this game. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5265.96s)]
*  It does bring back some memories. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5268.56s)]
*  I gotta be honest. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5269.96s)]
*  It's fair. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5271.28s)]
*  It's Bill. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5272.0s)]
*  It's always fair, fair to guys say guys remind you of great players and there's [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5272.68s)]
*  squabbles about them without going overboard and saying that they are that [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5277.72s)]
*  guy or, or, or as better than that guy. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5281.24s)]
*  I mean, absolutely. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5283.76s)]
*  And then he did people there's, there's types. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5285.24s)]
*  We all know that there's all kinds of types. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5288.88s)]
*  There's guys that remind you of that. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5290.6s)]
*  And then there were certain people that I don't, you know, they stand apart. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5292.0s)]
*  That there, and I always say that one of the things that the truly great players [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5297.64s)]
*  have something special that, that is uniquely theirs. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5303.12s)]
*  There's a, there's a something about their style. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5307.16s)]
*  Maybe it's a quirk of some kind, but you know, and they don't have to be the top [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5310.72s)]
*  of the line player, but I'm talking about just a hall of fame level, excellent [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5316.4800000000005s)]
*  player could be very special in a way that nobody else reminds you of him. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5320.0s)]
*  For example, and you'll like this, I think. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5325.16s)]
*  I'm not saying he's the greatest player or the greatest guard of all time. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5329.48s)]
*  I'd like that, but I've never seen another Dennis Johnson. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5332.16s)]
*  There's something about his package. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5335.16s)]
*  That's the word we want to use the packaging. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5337.2s)]
*  His package was, was special and different and, and, and worked for him. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5339.84s)]
*  And I haven't seen anybody that reminds me. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5345.72s)]
*  I've never seen anybody reminds me of him. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5347.6s)]
*  And yet there were plenty of other great players that somebody would, [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5349.719999999999s)]
*  you know, reminds you of them. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5352.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5354.28s)]
*  Dennis Johnson is a good one because he had size. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5354.719999999999s)]
*  He could kind of jump, but he would pick his spots. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5358.0s)]
*  We got him with the Celtics. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5360.32s)]
*  It was like a slightly different part of his career because he was so good on [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5362.0s)]
*  Seattle and that, you know, it was a big part of those two finals teams. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5365.28s)]
*  But, um, the way he would pick his spots, the only person that kind of reminds [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5368.48s)]
*  me of him is Drew with the way Drew has gears during the season and then gears [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5372.24s)]
*  in games and then in a fourth quarter can elevate a level where he goes from [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5377.56s)]
*  being a role player to being, you could really feel it in the Celtics Orlando [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5382.6s)]
*  series, where it's just like, I feel like Drew, and sometimes I feel like he's [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5385.96s)]
*  the second most important guy in the Celtics for the late game stuff. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5390.04s)]
*  So he's in the right spots. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5393.76s)]
*  Can always count him, get the right rebound. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5395.4800000000005s)]
*  I always feel like he's going to make a three. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5397.120000000001s)]
*  He can guard anybody in the other team. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5399.120000000001s)]
*  And that, that part reminds me of DJ, I think, but I think you're right. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5400.72s)]
*  There's DJ was a one-on-one. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5403.56s)]
*  But of course I, part of that is when we knew him and we knew, we saw him [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5405.04s)]
*  night in and night out and understood the, the, the, uh, the, the overall [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5409.2s)]
*  approach that he took, which was that he didn't play a hundred percent all the time. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5414.84s)]
*  He took nights off and he said 85, 86. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5419.56s)]
*  He's absolutely positively, but he pre-announced them to the team, to Danny [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5422.44s)]
*  specifically, I love this Danny tonight, you're getting the shots and he always [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5426.96s)]
*  picked a team that they were going to kick their ass at home. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5431.08s)]
*  It wasn't a game the way the game was going to be one. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5433.72s)]
*  And, and you can see I've got the logging game by game and, oh, minutes [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5435.76s)]
*  played 28 FGA four, uh, you know, Danny minutes played, you know, FGA 17. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5440.360000000001s)]
*  Um, because DJ was taking the night off. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5449.12s)]
*  And yet the converse is when, uh, when the big games came, you wanted that guy. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5452.68s)]
*  And Larry Bird would be the first one to tell you. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5457.92s)]
*  And as he, as he famously anointed him as the best player we ever played with [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5460.12s)]
*  and, and, and, and never back down from that. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5463.5199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5466.2s)]
*  Well, you know, another one on one, this up fun combo. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5467.04s)]
*  Um, just cause like, like I always think about this stuff and you're one of the [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5470.04s)]
*  fit, I probably learned it from you. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5473.6s)]
*  I've never seen anyone rebound like Moses, like Moses at his peak. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5475.92s)]
*  I've never seen anybody, whatever he was doing. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5479.96s)]
*  I remember writing about it in my book where he would go, he'd almost go to the [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5482.36s)]
*  baseline almost out of bounds. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5485.599999999999s)]
*  And then he would just back into people. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5487.28s)]
*  And I've never seen anyone do that before since, like he would just use his ass [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5489.599999999999s)]
*  as this like weapon and all of a sudden guys were flying backwards and he was [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5494.0s)]
*  right next to the rim and I've just never seen it. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5497.5599999999995s)]
*  No, he was special. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5500.599999999999s)]
*  And in that regard, it was to me, the number one rule of rebounding. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5501.879999999999s)]
*  Do you want the damn ball or don't you? [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5505.96s)]
*  And, and, you know, he wanted every rebound. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5507.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, and there's two types of, of, of, of rebounding. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5510.08s)]
*  I mean, and there's two types of, of, of statistically good rebounders. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5513.44s)]
*  There's guys who get what comes to them and they're big and they're stronger. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5517.24s)]
*  They're athletic. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5520.719999999999s)]
*  And there's guys that get rebounds to quote, don't belong to them unquote. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5521.839999999999s)]
*  And, and, uh, Moses was the champion of getting rebounds that didn't belong to [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5525.5599999999995s)]
*  him. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5530.0s)]
*  And that's what he lived for. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5530.5199999999995s)]
*  Rebounding was his reason was his identity and his, I know that that [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5532.0s)]
*  mattered. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5536.12s)]
*  That was the part of the game that mattered the most to him. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5536.5199999999995s)]
*  There was, there was no question about that. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5538.5599999999995s)]
*  He was an okay offensive player. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5540.5599999999995s)]
*  He didn't have a great repertoire. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5542.2s)]
*  You know, he had a big man post, you know, power stuff, but he wasn't a finesse [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5543.96s)]
*  anyway, shape or form a finesse offensive player, but, uh, he sure was a phenomenal [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5549.48s)]
*  rebound. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5554.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5555.5199999999995s)]
*  That's what I love though. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5555.72s)]
*  Game four of the golden state series. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5556.88s)]
*  J ma made that big stop and then Butler claimed flying in for this crazy rebound [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5558.72s)]
*  and traffic. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5564.12s)]
*  And it was just like, I'm getting this rebound. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5564.72s)]
*  That was, I went to the Laker game last night and they're just getting killed on [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5566.4s)]
*  the boards and everybody's just kind of looking around at each other. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5571.04s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5574.16s)]
*  Are you good? [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5575.36s)]
*  But nobody was like, shit, I better get some rebounds. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5576.16s)]
*  You know, like I think about 2010 game seven, cause saw was, you know, really [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5579.5199999999995s)]
*  taking it to KG, but Kobe, cause he wasn't making shots and Kobe's like, I'm [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5584.36s)]
*  just going to have to go get, try to get as many rebounds as I can and came flying [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5589.0s)]
*  in. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5592.6s)]
*  And that's what swung that game. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5592.76s)]
*  Nobody in the Lakers did that last night. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5594.64s)]
*  Everybody was like, ah, Rudy go bear. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5596.48s)]
*  I wish we had a center. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5597.92s)]
*  And that you could watch them rolling over in real time. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5599.24s)]
*  It was kind of crazy. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5601.84s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5602.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5603.88s)]
*  Well, I think the whole thing, they, they, I'm guessing I wasn't, I never [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5604.12s)]
*  did anything in person as you did, but the Lakers, I guess, recognized the [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5608.96s)]
*  futility of their circumstance. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5613.4400000000005s)]
*  Some point during the middle of this series and I mean, you know, and they, [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5615.0s)]
*  they just weren't, didn't have a deep enough roster. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5621.28s)]
*  They could, they're lucky they had two guys that alone three. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5623.4400000000005s)]
*  And anyway, we all know you saw it and you know, so. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5626.12s)]
*  Now we'll see what that all season brings. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5629.04s)]
*  Um, all right. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5631.400000000001s)]
*  More guys now and where you see them. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5632.24s)]
*  Who is Brunson to you? [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5635.4800000000005s)]
*  Brunson almost seems like he's at a 1974. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5636.76s)]
*  Like he could have been easily on the, on the next with Walt Frazier. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5639.84s)]
*  Yeah, very, very true. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5644.36s)]
*  You could, uh, Brunson is one of those guys that you could easily see playing [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5645.56s)]
*  in 1968 all-star game as well as playing today. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5648.64s)]
*  Uh, there's, I had two guys in a previous generation that I said were [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5652.72s)]
*  complete throwbacks games that they were in combinations of the 1950. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5657.4s)]
*  They could, the combination of Doshays in the 21st century, Paul [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5661.92s)]
*  Pierce and Manu Genobili. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5665.799999999999s)]
*  Those two guys had old games and spiced up with a three pointer. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5667.96s)]
*  You know, they, they, they added the little extra sauce, which was the [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5673.2s)]
*  three pointer, but other than that, their game would have translated very [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5676.44s)]
*  well in previous generations. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5679.24s)]
*  Brunson, he just, he, he makes, he shows you what, what you have to do if you're [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5681.32s)]
*  going to excel at his size and he's figured out, you know, the angles, he's [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5686.52s)]
*  figuring out deception timing, uh, and strong. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5691.92s)]
*  He's strong. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5695.68s)]
*  He can take a bump and, and, and keep the shot when he goes to hoop it. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5696.400000000001s)]
*  And he just, he's got a basketball mind, a PhD. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5699.68s)]
*  Um, you know, he's a, he's a player's son and his coach's son who really [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5702.96s)]
*  had obviously absorbed all the lessons. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5707.040000000001s)]
*  And, and you, and he's got, and people talk about the flopping. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5709.160000000001s)]
*  It doesn't even bother me at all. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5713.360000000001s)]
*  I think actually he's just smart. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5714.4800000000005s)]
*  That's all I don't buy. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5716.2s)]
*  I don't mind with him. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5717.36s)]
*  I got with, I've minded with some people over the years, but it doesn't [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5718.2s)]
*  bother me at all with him. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5721.28s)]
*  I, I, I, you go guy. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5722.76s)]
*  I love him. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5724.400000000001s)]
*  I just think he's, he's, he's a special. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5725.12s)]
*  And here's the thing, uh, Bill, when they got him, and I always had my eye on him [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5727.6s)]
*  back to Villanova and now, of course I didn't see him play much in Dallas, you [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5731.52s)]
*  know, but I knew he was there, but when they got him, I said, oh, that's a good [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5735.4800000000005s)]
*  move, very good move, but they've overpaid. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5740.16s)]
*  He's not a star. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5742.72s)]
*  He's a, he's a wonderful auxiliary player. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5743.8s)]
*  That's what I thought. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5746.08s)]
*  Oh boy. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5747.56s)]
*  Is he turned out to be worth every penny for them. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5748.400000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5752.76s)]
*  Do you make anything, do you make anything of the fact that only one team built [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5753.4400000000005s)]
*  around a small guy in the history of the league has ever won a title? [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5758.2s)]
*  Yes. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5762.8s)]
*  I think it's a good historical lesson. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5763.84s)]
*  I'm fine. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5765.76s)]
*  I've had this discussion this year, uh, with people about, uh, you go back over [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5766.0s)]
*  the history of the NBA and, uh, I'm, I only can think of one in my time anyway. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5770.96s)]
*  You know, I'm, um, and I'm thinking about what I know about the fifties and [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5777.4800000000005s)]
*  Cousy never won till we got Russell. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5780.76s)]
*  And, and, and so, uh, and he was the preeminent guy and then, and the other [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5782.76s)]
*  guys, the other global guards of his near near him were Slater and Martin. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5786.92s)]
*  And he did win. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5790.52s)]
*  He had Mike in and Bobby Davies and they won one in 51. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5791.24s)]
*  But anyway, Isaiah Thomas arguably was the best player on the bed, boy Pistons, [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5796.48s)]
*  and they went back to back and could have won three in a row and cause they were [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5802.0s)]
*  jobbed in 88 on a terrible call. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5805.4s)]
*  Don't get me started. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5807.4s)]
*  Lambeer. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5808.4s)]
*  You know, when they put Lambeer and they put Kareem on the line and [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5809.08s)]
*  that was a terrible call. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5813.32s)]
*  But anyway, I say, I think we're on the same page here. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5814.72s)]
*  Only exit only Stockton never won. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5818.32s)]
*  You know, um, Chris, Paul, uh, Nash. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5821.72s)]
*  No, no, no, it's hard. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5826.599999999999s)]
*  It's hard when your best player is a point guard and the next [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5829.36s)]
*  best player is a point guard. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5833.8s)]
*  And so we, we, you know, we'll see how far they can go. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5836.08s)]
*  Not just this year, but in the future, uh, with their best [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5839.96s)]
*  player being Jalen Brunson. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5843.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5845.72s)]
*  Cause there was a great book about the Pistons in the late eighties, how they [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5845.96s)]
*  put together that title team with McCloskey called the franchise. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5849.92s)]
*  And it was all about them with this conundrum of the league had been around [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5853.12s)]
*  for four decades at that point. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5857.32s)]
*  Isaiah was their best player is one of the best players in the league, but [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5859.36s)]
*  nobody had ever won with a small guy. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5862.08s)]
*  So what do you have to do? [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5863.64s)]
*  And basically the answer was Isaiah had to give up a lot of his offense, [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5864.56s)]
*  lead the team really, he could have had 30 a game instead. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5868.64s)]
*  He scored like 22 a game, 23, whatever it was. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5872.36s)]
*  And he was trying to get everyone else involved. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5876.08s)]
*  And sometimes I wonder, like when I watch Brunson, how much he has the ball, [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5877.88s)]
*  if he's not like, are they better off with him scoring seven less points a game? [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5882.24s)]
*  You know, that issue was raised earlier in this series in least in the [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5886.400000000001s)]
*  New York post anyway, I didn't read, I read that every day and I didn't see it. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5892.320000000001s)]
*  And, and they raised that issue that, um, uh, he, he, he's got to be [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5896.280000000001s)]
*  less ball dominant for this team. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5901.08s)]
*  And the next came out and he was, and, uh, in fact, so yeah, that's a very, [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5902.6s)]
*  it's a fine life, like so many things in basketball. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5907.360000000001s)]
*  That's why I love the, among the reasons I love the game I love, but, but the, [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5909.759999999999s)]
*  the, the, the, what goes into winning, you know, and, and they need to [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5913.92s)]
*  calibrate guys skills. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5918.599999999999s)]
*  And so I always said about, about Jordan, uh, and the difference when Jordan, [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5921.16s)]
*  people think he didn't win a championship. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5926.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5929.639999999999s)]
*  You got, you needed to win the championship when he finally got Scotty Pippen [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5929.8s)]
*  as a, as a tremendous sidekick. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5932.679999999999s)]
*  But until we learn how to calibrate his skills with the other guys and not, you [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5934.5199999999995s)]
*  know, and, and balance it out and know when to take over, when not to take over, [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5939.0s)]
*  know who to go to, when not. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5942.48s)]
*  I mean, this, this, this is all very, very important stuff that you just [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5943.8s)]
*  don't throw together talent. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5947.24s)]
*  You've got to, you've got to play the game in a quote unquote right way. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5948.6s)]
*  And that's a universal truth. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5952.48s)]
*  And, and, uh, uh, you got to figure out how I'm going to blend with the other [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5954.36s)]
*  guys, there's one ball and five guys. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5958.08s)]
*  And I know, I mean, uh, but to my better, and that was Mr. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5961.56s)]
*  Petey Carrell used to talk about that. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5964.8s)]
*  Bradley grew up thinking that way. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5966.08s)]
*  And, and you got to, you got to be able to think that way. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5968.0s)]
*  Byrd understood that. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5970.76s)]
*  And, and, and I've got no magic understood that. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5972.12s)]
*  And Michael didn't originally do, even though it came about in North Carolina, [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5974.68s)]
*  indeed, but he finally figured it out. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5979.4800000000005s)]
*  And once he did the championship started to flow. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5981.360000000001s)]
*  How about Luca? [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5983.64s)]
*  First of all, is he a one-on-one and second, do you think he'll ever understand [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5985.400000000001s)]
*  that balance of I have to make everybody else better? [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5988.8s)]
*  Maybe I don't need to score 35 a game. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5991.88s)]
*  Where, where does he, where do you see for him from a title standpoint? [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5993.88s)]
*  First of all, before we get to that, I was thinking that I know one person sitting [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=5997.240000000001s)]
*  back having an extra taut, a lot like tidy night last year was Nico Harrison. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6000.4400000000005s)]
*  He must've been smiling as the Lakers out the window. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6005.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, anyway. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6008.0s)]
*  Um, yeah, Luca interesting there because, um, um, he does have the ball, [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6009.08s)]
*  you know, all the time. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6014.4800000000005s)]
*  And, uh, I, it's, it's hard. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6016.4400000000005s)]
*  I, I, I think he's still, he's still only 25. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6020.400000000001s)]
*  He's still got lessons he can learn. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6023.52s)]
*  Uh, I, I think he's smart enough to feel, we recognize, uh, that he's got to [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6025.2s)]
*  think in those, in these terms that we're talking about, but, uh, the Lakers [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6032.4800000000005s)]
*  still, unfortunately for them, uh, you know, their roster is shy and, and, you [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6036.4s)]
*  know, now who knows where they go from here with, uh, the Bron and we played [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6040.84s)]
*  40 years, 41 years old in December of this year. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6045.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6049.44s)]
*  Is he going to play again and blah, blah, blah. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6050.0s)]
*  No, Lucas interesting, you know, in that regard, he's, he's so skilled, [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6051.64s)]
*  but that's, that's the thing that, that when you have all that skill, you have [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6054.76s)]
*  to learn how to utilize it properly. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6057.76s)]
*  There's no question, you know, and, um, some nights it seems like that he does. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6059.64s)]
*  And, and, uh, other nights he's got the ball too much. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6064.56s)]
*  So I don't think he's fully gotten there yet. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6067.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6069.280000000001s)]
*  I wonder, I'm sure they're going to be talking all summer. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6069.52s)]
*  Is he going to get in shape? [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6072.76s)]
*  No, seriously. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6073.96s)]
*  He's going to take this. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6074.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6075.92s)]
*  There's the whole defense thing too, with him, you know, and I wondered my big [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6077.16s)]
*  question about the series before they started was will people, will the other [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6080.16s)]
*  guys be able to take advantage? [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6084.96s)]
*  You know, how much can you explain him on defense? [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6086.2s)]
*  You know, and, and, uh, it happened. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6089.0s)]
*  And, uh, uh, that's something that the Lakers have to be realistic about. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6091.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6095.72s)]
*  They, the Lakers case can hinge down, hinged on, uh, can [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6095.96s)]
*  Luke and not get torched on defense? [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6099.44s)]
*  Can we get any rebounds and how much can we ask from LeBron? [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6101.16s)]
*  And as the series went along, LeBron started to die, especially in these fourth [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6104.08s)]
*  quarters, he, so he's, you said he's going to be [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6107.28s)]
*  41 next year during the playoffs. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6109.88s)]
*  Um, I think that's right. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6112.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6113.68s)]
*  Um, have a 30th, so I know that. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6114.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6117.76s)]
*  So have a check, have a check played 16 years and it seemed like 40 when, [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6118.04s)]
*  how, when have a check where it was like, Oh my God, somebody played 16 years in [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6125.32s)]
*  the NBA, this is impossible, but then probably could have played a couple of [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6129.08s)]
*  years more, like he, you were going to those. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6133.36s)]
*  I, I, by the way, I've got a column in the hopper. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6136.24s)]
*  It's either going to come out Sunday or the week after they, they, they didn't [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6138.5199999999995s)]
*  tell me which one they want to run. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6142.679999999999s)]
*  So it's on, it's on have a check by the way, for reasons that you'll see. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6143.719999999999s)]
*  Um, and, and you'll like, but, uh, I know you will like it, but, um, uh, John did [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6147.36s)]
*  not quit because he couldn't play anymore. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6152.48s)]
*  His game had diminished short to me. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6155.36s)]
*  He averaged 16 points a game that year. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6156.879999999999s)]
*  Um, but he could still play and, and he, he, he's, you know, when he, he said he [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6159.28s)]
*  would have hung around if he had any idea how good bird was going to be, you know, [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6164.24s)]
*  and, and he would have hung around anyway. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6168.16s)]
*  No, John played 16 years. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6169.84s)]
*  He was ended 38 went out with a 29 point game. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6171.28s)]
*  Uh, and, and he quit cause he didn't like the circumstance anymore. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6174.16s)]
*  He wasn't having fun with, with the way that the Celtics had deteriorated in [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6177.0s)]
*  the locker room, quite frankly. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6181.639999999999s)]
*  And, uh, it was a down period. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6183.04s)]
*  And, um, so anyway, but he still had skill. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6185.639999999999s)]
*  Uh, he, he, he went out, he went out to being able to play, but he was 38. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6188.96s)]
*  Uh, that year he ended. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6193.639999999999s)]
*  In fact, he ended, uh, the day that his last game was a day after his 38th [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6195.32s)]
*  birthday, by the way, and that just so happened. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6201.24s)]
*  He had turned 38 the day he was born, April 8th, 1940. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6204.92s)]
*  And his last game was April 9th, 1978. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6207.96s)]
*  Wow. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6210.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6211.4s)]
*  Cause they always, always stories about how he would come and like just play with [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6211.599999999999s)]
*  them and scrimmages and stuff when like three, four years later and was still [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6215.5199999999995s)]
*  pretty good and they couldn't believe how good he was. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6219.12s)]
*  These guys, these young guys, you know, that, that, that, that this, this, [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6222.12s)]
*  yeah, that was his birthday present to himself to come to practice and suit up. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6225.0s)]
*  Well, so, I mean, this is the question with Lebron cause we saw it with Brady [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6229.68s)]
*  where he just kept playing and, you know, in the 2017, 18 range, they had Garoppolo [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6234.360000000001s)]
*  and it's like, how long can this go? [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6239.92s)]
*  They needed succession playing quarterbacks don't play this long. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6241.24s)]
*  And then he just kept going and going and going. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6243.72s)]
*  Like, I do feel like there can be generational freaks. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6246.56s)]
*  I really wonder how long Lebron can go. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6249.68s)]
*  I think he could still keep playing, but if he's going to be making $50 million [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6253.6s)]
*  a year as one of your two expensive guys, that's where it becomes problematic. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6257.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6262.400000000001s)]
*  Because you're, you're just asking, like, you're asking for nine, 10, nine [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6262.72s)]
*  months a year, potentially if you're going to win the finals from this guy that [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6266.84s)]
*  you need to rely on for all these different things, because he's in your [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6270.4800000000005s)]
*  $50 million spot and that's where I don't know what the, it almost seems like the [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6272.96s)]
*  answer might be, maybe he needs to take less and try to boost up the team and [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6277.0s)]
*  think about it that way, but I don't know if he would do that. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6282.48s)]
*  And I don't know. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6285.5199999999995s)]
*  That's obviously would be a very rational solution that, you know, we know along [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6286.08s)]
*  the way, supposedly Brady was able to do that in his time with the contracts. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6291.679999999999s)]
*  And it's always wonderful. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6297.28s)]
*  And, you know, the money that we're talking about, these people make, it [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6298.839999999999s)]
*  shouldn't be that hard to decision if you really want to win, you know, that. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6302.2s)]
*  They make it off the court too, right? [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6305.719999999999s)]
*  Like they can still make up money all these different ways. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6307.4s)]
*  But the issue about whether how long he's occasionally, has he not at times [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6311.08s)]
*  over the years or recent years when somebody would kiddingly say about [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6318.84s)]
*  playing you a 45, not dismiss the possibility that he wouldn't keep, want [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6323.16s)]
*  to keep playing till he's 45, you know, I mean, if you did too, I used to look [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6327.5599999999995s)]
*  at, I remember thinking about Brady this way, if you were to deteriorate, take [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6332.16s)]
*  a percentage five, 10%, you know, with how much would you still like to have them? [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6336.72s)]
*  And the answer was always us still taking if defined deteriorates 10% next year. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6341.4400000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6346.280000000001s)]
*  That's still pretty good player based on what he was able to produce this year. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6347.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6351.8s)]
*  And so it's, you know, the Hicks totally could still play in this game. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6352.92s)]
*  Uh, he is in phenomenal shape. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6358.0s)]
*  Uh, we learned that he spends literally a million dollars a year and on [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6360.08s)]
*  conditioning and more. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6364.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6366.96s)]
*  And, and he, we see the benefit of it. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6367.52s)]
*  It's, and we've never been, we've had old guys, we've got, they've always been the [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6369.92s)]
*  old, the two oldest guys I can think of that played long this long were, were [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6374.12s)]
*  Kevin Willison and Robert Parrish who still holds the record for most games, [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6378.04s)]
*  which I guess LeBron is eventually going to eclipse, but, um, uh, well, and then [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6381.64s)]
*  the old, old Washington Kareem, I think got to 42 and he was like 41 or 42. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6386.88s)]
*  But those guys got into their 42 and three range. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6392.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6394.64s)]
*  Uh, particularly Ponce, uh, LeBron, but, but they weren't running up. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6394.88s)]
*  They weren't doing the work, you know, the up and down work that LeBron does, [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6400.32s)]
*  you know, they were doing them down lower at work. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6404.56s)]
*  But anyway, we haven't seen anything like this when I'm babbling and say, we [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6407.12s)]
*  haven't seen anything like this before. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6411.08s)]
*  Anybody that could play the game the way he plays it at this time, at this level, [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6412.32s)]
*  uh, at this age, we haven't seen that before. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6416.36s)]
*  He's, he's, you know, it's a whole new territory that we're exploring. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6418.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6421.76s)]
*  I voted for him second team on NBA and I stand by it. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6421.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6425.52s)]
*  It just thought he was one of the, I mean, there were a lot of injuries, but, um, [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6425.92s)]
*  Jason Tatum, what do you see when you see him? [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6429.92s)]
*  Who do you see? [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6432.4s)]
*  Who do you see pieces of with Jason Tatum? [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6433.56s)]
*  Jason Tatum at six feet 10 is, uh, the most all-around skilled player. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6437.08s)]
*  The Celtics have ever had at six feet 10. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6444.2s)]
*  Uh, you know, Larry didn't possess that kind of ball handling ability. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6447.12s)]
*  Larry didn't possess that kind of get your own shot that you will against [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6450.92s)]
*  almost anybody at any time. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6455.56s)]
*  You know, most people, but there were people, you know, we know that could [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6457.56s)]
*  give him, irritate him. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6461.28s)]
*  Uh, this guy, the, it's funny because he's, he's like Pierce on steroids [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6463.4400000000005s)]
*  because, you know, I declared 20 years ago that Paul Pierce was the best scoring [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6468.56s)]
*  machine in Celtic history, you know, not the best player, still Larry, but, but [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6473.2s)]
*  the best scoring machine that he had every aspect of scoring, you know, and [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6478.0s)]
*  know what they say now, all three levels, right? [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6482.2s)]
*  Well, the fact is that, uh, his mid-range games was superb and he can get a shot [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6484.12s)]
*  off anytime he wanted, and he could, and he had a three point range and he's the [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6488.28s)]
*  best bill. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6491.52s)]
*  I think he's the best finisher on a break. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6492.2s)]
*  The Celtics have ever had was, was Paul Pierce and, um, he had that and he, and [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6493.68s)]
*  don't foul him because he's an 80 plus percent way up there, mid 80s percent [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6498.72s)]
*  homework free throw shooter. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6503.16s)]
*  This is the best all-around consummate individual offensive player that they [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6504.6s)]
*  have ever had. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6507.84s)]
*  Jason Tatum is making a bid for this honor. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6508.84s)]
*  And, and the matter of fact, I'm sure a lot of people now think he's already [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6511.32s)]
*  earned it and that's funny. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6514.0s)]
*  You mentioned, not funny, but I'm glad you mentioned this because I've already [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6515.24s)]
*  been on local public record as saying he just came off yet another yawn routine [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6517.92s)]
*  35 point X rebound ecstasy scheme, uh, in a playoff and it's not getting enough [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6524.08s)]
*  credit for it here in Boston. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6530.360000000001s)]
*  He's not, uh, this is part of the curse of the, the history of the franchise. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6532.52s)]
*  He's, he's up against, you know, the Haberchecks and the Larrys and the [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6536.88s)]
*  pierces that's, that's who, what happens when you come to Boston and, and there's [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6540.26s)]
*  good in that and there's bad in that, you know, and, and this guy's, I, he's, he's [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6545.04s)]
*  not, I hope he's going to be totally appreciated for what he's done and how [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6550.4400000000005s)]
*  much he's improved his game and then broadened his game. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6553.88s)]
*  Last year, the big thing I took away from the playoffs with him was improved [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6556.84s)]
*  defensive rebounding, traffic rebounding. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6560.4400000000005s)]
*  I thought he, he became a terrific traffic rebounder last year, which to [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6562.64s)]
*  the likes I hadn't seen before. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6567.12s)]
*  We know he's brought in his passing game, you know, and, uh, and, and then [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6568.88s)]
*  his individual offense, uh, sometimes, I mean, some of these step backs there, [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6573.88s)]
*  you know, cause all over the league, we're getting used to it. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6578.08s)]
*  Curry has set a template, you know, for distance that you've got to match now. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6580.88s)]
*  Uh, and you call that used to call it curry land. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6585.4800000000005s)]
*  Now I call it Caitlin Clark land, but that's just great for another day. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6587.240000000001s)]
*  And, but, you know, look at the shot that, how about the shot that [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6590.32s)]
*  Carl Anthony counts made that, that last jumper the other night, we had the one [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6593.84s)]
*  where he was going out of bounds, which was a, that was a bird-like shot going [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6599.16s)]
*  out of bounds on a, on a baseline, making that from almost behind the backboard. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6602.92s)]
*  The next shot that was five feet behind the arc, minimal seven feet tall. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6607.08s)]
*  Uh, but Pierce has, I'm sure, excuse me, Tatum has this ability to make [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6612.72s)]
*  step backs almost in that range. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6616.72s)]
*  And, and people, I think people hear, I'm taking him for granted. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6618.6s)]
*  I really do. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6622.84s)]
*  And I don't know what more they want out of him, frankly. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6623.92s)]
*  I agree with you. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6626.92s)]
*  I've been talking about it all year and then people get mad at me that I'm [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6627.84s)]
*  talking about the Tatum too much. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6630.76s)]
*  And I just feel like he's made such a leap from two years ago to last year. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6632.64s)]
*  But then last year to this year where there was, I thought Tatum and Brown [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6637.360000000001s)]
*  last year were one A one B in a lot of ways. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6641.08s)]
*  Brown was awesome last year. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6643.2s)]
*  And the distance between them, you know, is you never knew who was going to be [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6644.68s)]
*  the best guy in a given game. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6648.56s)]
*  Now Tatum is clearly the best guy in the team. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6649.92s)]
*  I think he's clearly either the third or fourth best guy in the league. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6653.08s)]
*  And you didn't even talk about like how good his defense is and his ability to [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6658.320000000001s)]
*  guard all these different positions. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6662.360000000001s)]
*  But the, the rebounding is the thing I love the most. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6664.04s)]
*  I he's their best rebounder by far. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6666.84s)]
*  You take a game like that Minnesota Lakers game last night, he just would've gone [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6669.280000000001s)]
*  under there and battled go bear and gotten like 14 rebounds. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6673.32s)]
*  Cause he's like, this is, we're going to lose unless I do this. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6676.36s)]
*  I think I, I appreciate that piece of it the most. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6679.5199999999995s)]
*  I just think he's turned in as such a, I don't want to say bully, but there's, [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6682.5599999999995s)]
*  there's, there's a toughness to him this year. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6688.16s)]
*  There's a confidence. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6691.639999999999s)]
*  I mean, he's a, I mean, obviously he's, he's, he's smart and, and, and, and he's [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6692.36s)]
*  a, he's smart and confident, but humble too. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6697.12s)]
*  He's, you know, there's nothing, nothing like with this [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6700.759999999999s)]
*  and you know, the whole package, I don't see anything. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6703.48s)]
*  It's a no yeah, but you know, I don't have a year, but then on him and, and we, [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6706.32s)]
*  and we know off the court is his personal life with it. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6711.639999999999s)]
*  It's wonderful kids and you know, the whole thing is he's, he's entirely [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6714.639999999999s)]
*  rootable is where I'm trying to spit out here. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6718.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6720.24s)]
*  I think this year people will appreciate him more. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6720.5599999999995s)]
*  I think if this goes a couple more rounds, I think he's going to get [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6723.639999999999s)]
*  if they win, you know, if they don't win, you know, that there'll be all this [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6728.2s)]
*  and, and I get, don't get me, you know, I'm not a championship or bust guy. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6732.84s)]
*  Okay. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6737.360000000001s)]
*  I've never have been, I never will be because too many variables going to [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6737.68s)]
*  winning any championship, including in this game seven and things are going [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6741.120000000001s)]
*  great and then somebody goes down, they can happen and we know that. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6745.52s)]
*  So I don't take anything for granted there. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6749.240000000001s)]
*  I I'll say this. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6752.6s)]
*  I'm going off T here a little bit. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6754.280000000001s)]
*  If anybody other than okay. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6756.76s)]
*  See Cleveland or Boston wins. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6759.160000000001s)]
*  I'll be stunned. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6760.52s)]
*  One of those three is going to win. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6761.679999999999s)]
*  You got to draw a line after those three teams in this league. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6763.44s)]
*  You have to, and that's that. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6765.8s)]
*  And one of them is going to win. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6767.96s)]
*  I don't know which one I'm anxious to see. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6769.32s)]
*  So I had the, and we're taking this for game six of Clippers Denver. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6772.2s)]
*  I had the Clippers in that conversation and just, I must add amnesia with James [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6775.36s)]
*  Harden. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6779.5599999999995s)]
*  I just, I just, I think I just forgot. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6780.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6781.96s)]
*  Maybe I blocked it out of my mind or whatever. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6782.28s)]
*  And it's like, what am I doing? [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6784.24s)]
*  Of course, of course they're not making the finals with a, with James Harden. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6785.48s)]
*  I should have known. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6789.28s)]
*  Um, let's, let's take a quick break and then we'll come back. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6790.04s)]
*  I want to talk about Yocage. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6793.360000000001s)]
*  All right. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6794.76s)]
*  We're talking history, current NBA got to talk. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6795.0s)]
*  Yocage. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6798.08s)]
*  I went to the game Saturday, uh, when he just would not let them lose against the, [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6799.2s)]
*  uh, Clippers and basically played the whole game and just did everything. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6805.24s)]
*  And it was a man. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6809.8s)]
*  Absolutely possessed. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6811.56s)]
*  And it was, you know, it was up there for me with LeBron and game six in 2012. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6813.12s)]
*  And some of the Jordan stuff I'd seen in person, just when I'm thinking about the [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6819.52s)]
*  best players I've ever seen in person, this now move, this moved him just being [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6822.6s)]
*  at that game and just being like, Oh my God, I can't believe how good this guy is. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6827.2s)]
*  Um, where, where do you put them? [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6831.64s)]
*  I never thought we'd see another Bill Walton. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6833.64s)]
*  I never thought we'd see another bird. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6835.68s)]
*  And yet there's pieces of both of those guys and a lot of the stuff he's doing. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6837.96s)]
*  And he's also doing way more than that. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6841.24s)]
*  But when you watch him, like, did you ever think we'd see anything like this ever? [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6842.84s)]
*  Let's go back early in his career here. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6846.48s)]
*  And I remember a local writer out there, uh, can talk to me and ask about his [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6849.12s)]
*  passing and how did I think his passing rated with, with Walton? [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6856.44s)]
*  And I hadn't seen enough of them to have. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6862.4s)]
*  I couldn't believe I was having this discussion that anyone would be so sacrilegious [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6864.0s)]
*  as to suggest that there was a center who would come along to pass anywhere near as [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6869.879999999999s)]
*  well as Bill Walton. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6874.36s)]
*  And guess what? [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6874.96s)]
*  He said that that was a fair, he is right. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6875.96s)]
*  I mean, he's there and, uh, the, the, you, we can have the argument. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6880.0s)]
*  Uh, he's so, and so that's the thing. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6884.5599999999995s)]
*  He's not only is he's good at passers Walton, but he's far superior score. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6887.92s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6891.92s)]
*  You know, not even questioned. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6892.599999999999s)]
*  And so my, my position on centers, as you probably well know, I mean, did you start [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6894.5599999999995s)]
*  with the three all timers and whichever one you want to make the devil's advocate [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6901.56s)]
*  argument for, go right ahead. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6907.160000000001s)]
*  Russell, Kareem and Wilt, you know, and I could, you know, fine. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6908.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, I'm a Russell guy, but I mean, I totally respect the other two for what they [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6912.080000000001s)]
*  were. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6915.200000000001s)]
*  And, and, and then I said, that's, then you draw a line. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6915.92s)]
*  Now we start to bring who's number four. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6919.160000000001s)]
*  Well, now we got a guy firmly entrenched in the, in the discussion, uh, that we'll [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6921.320000000001s)]
*  see how it all plays out, how many championships he'll win or whatever it is. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6928.120000000001s)]
*  But in terms of wanting to watch somebody play, uh, I'll tell you what, he's at the [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6931.36s)]
*  top of the list. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6938.92s)]
*  Uh, I mean, it's extraordinary. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6940.12s)]
*  You don't know what he's going to do next. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6941.6s)]
*  You don't know what incredible pass he's going to conjure up. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6942.88s)]
*  You don't know, uh, how many threes he's going to make. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6945.5199999999995s)]
*  You don't know how much, what, what rebound is going to get. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6948.08s)]
*  No, he's a, he's a treasure. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6950.88s)]
*  I mean, my God is it's a total delight to watch. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6952.12s)]
*  Uh, and, and he isn't, it's, you know, he's still got a long way to go, you know, [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6955.92s)]
*  depending on how long he wants to play. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6960.84s)]
*  We don't know. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6963.320000000001s)]
*  We know, we know he might want to go become a jockey, you know, a seven [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6963.88s)]

*  But, uh, uh, but anyway, I'm, I'm count me among the, the admirers, the [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6969.96s)]
*  idolaters of, of, uh, Nikola Djokic. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6975.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6978.64s)]
*  Russel and I had talked about this a little on Sunday, that this whole theory [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6978.84s)]
*  that he's just going to retire when he's 34 and be done with it after going to [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6982.080000000001s)]
*  that game on Saturday, I don't believe it. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6985.76s)]
*  The guy's too competitive. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6987.4800000000005s)]
*  You don't shut that off. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6988.92s)]
*  Like he was an absolute full-fledged maniac in that game. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6989.92s)]
*  And just in general, like, you know, there's pieces, like, obviously [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6993.64s)]
*  there's some Walton, there's a lot of bird. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=6997.8s)]
*  One of the things that him on defense reminds me a lot bird always had the. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7000.68s)]
*  The reputation of being not a good defensive player. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7004.84s)]
*  Meanwhile, he made all defenses and was always up there in steals, but his [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7007.36s)]
*  ability, Yokoji's ability to read what the other team's going to do on offense [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7011.36s)]
*  and know what they're doing in advance and then fuck it up basically before, [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7015.72s)]
*  as they're doing it, jumping in these spots where they're like, Oh, I didn't [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7019.24s)]
*  know somebody was going to be there. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7022.72s)]
*  He's just, his brain's always moving. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7024.36s)]
*  It's in person. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7026.679999999999s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7028.44s)]
*  I never thought after bird of magic, I never thought I would see somebody [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7029.28s)]
*  that processed the game like that. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7033.24s)]
*  You know, that to me, that's the standard. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7035.0s)]
*  It's always a danger of allowing yourself to think that way. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7038.44s)]
*  I've done it myself. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7041.599999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to, you never got to see anything. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7042.84s)]
*  I mean, when halichek retired, you know, I mean, of course, and we haven't seen, [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7045.04s)]
*  and we were talking earlier about styles and individualistic people and people [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7048.32s)]
*  that John hasn't been another half a check, but the point is in effectiveness [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7052.0s)]
*  bird comes along, you know, and vendors. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7056.0s)]
*  John is one a and something Pantheon now instead of one. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7058.04s)]
*  Yeah, you, you, you, you, you got to prepare yourself for, for, uh, [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7062.599999999999s)]
*  the evolution of the game. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7066.84s)]
*  This guy, uh, is really ultra special. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7068.32s)]
*  And, you know, and the thing that made bird so special ultimately was the mind [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7071.88s)]
*  game and playing thinking two steps ahead. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7075.48s)]
*  And now we've got a big guy. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7078.16s)]
*  Toward in him that, uh, you know, uh, that can do that as well. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7080.04s)]
*  No, it's, it's, it's, it's, he understands that the game, the game in a way that, [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7085.599999999999s)]
*  uh, somebody other guys never, never, never will. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7091.4s)]
*  No, no question. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7094.36s)]
*  So you have, you have like, there's that Hakeem Moses shack kind of area, right? [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7095.0s)]
*  And maybe Janice is like right underneath it. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7101.4s)]
*  And you already have Yocage in that area, potentially looking at that spot [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7104.44s)]
*  right under Wilton Kareem. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7108.919999999999s)]
*  Oh, he's at a bridge right now. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7110.799999999999s)]
*  You're kidding. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7112.4s)]
*  First of all, my number four is Hakeem. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7112.96s)]
*  Okay. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7115.36s)]
*  He's my number four. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7116.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7117.599999999999s)]
*  So, uh, oh, so we're in between. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7118.28s)]
*  He's, he's closer to the big three. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7121.32s)]
*  Did he is the four. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7122.759999999999s)]
*  I mean, he's going to be in that, he's going to have to be in that discussion. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7123.799999999999s)]
*  Um, you know, and until we're going to hard on championships, I will want to, [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7127.4s)]
*  you know, and, uh, and the other guys won multiple in Russell, of course, won 11 [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7132.599999999999s)]
*  and Kareem won what six, whatever five or six. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7136.96s)]
*  Shack had four. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7139.5199999999995s)]
*  Moses had one. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7140.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7142.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7143.2s)]
*  I mean, you know, Moses, you know, was, wasn't pretty, but he was effective. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7143.44s)]
*  Um, but anyway, uh, Robert Parrish got three, by the way, cause he got one with [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7148.5599999999995s)]
*  the bulls by the way, although he wasn't prominent anyway. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7152.24s)]
*  Um, anyway, he's got, I got him in between four. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7155.799999999999s)]
*  He's at three and a half right now. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7160.28s)]

*  All right. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7164.84s)]
*  So we go, we're your, your whole premise that I loved where we're playing the [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7165.12s)]
*  aliens and we can grab anybody and Yocage, Yocage, bird and magic agree to come. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7169.719999999999s)]
*  And now we need to find two more guys to put with those three where we're just [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7176.12s)]
*  like, we're just going to have the aliens backpedaling, not knowing what's happening. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7179.679999999999s)]
*  Just amazing passing. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7184.36s)]

*  Well, I still want Mike Michael. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7189.44s)]
*  Okay. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7190.92s)]
*  You know, and you know who I'll take now because they give me a weapon, you know, [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7191.88s)]
*  not since I got magic, I got the ball handling, I got the de-orchestration, [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7196.2s)]
*  I got the fast break, I got everything settled, you know, who's the one that I [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7200.76s)]
*  got, I got special qualities that he had. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7204.2s)]
*  Stefan Kerr. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7207.96s)]
*  Why not? [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7209.6s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7229.04s)]
*  Why would we dismiss the greatest shooter of all time? [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7229.8s)]
*  I, uh, and, uh, who's a team guy. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7233.16s)]
*  Oh, by the way, who can also pass by the way, he's people. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7236.16s)]
*  He's not a point guard. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7240.28s)]
*  He's a two guard. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7241.76s)]
*  Period. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7244.2s)]
*  He's not a point guard. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7245.0s)]
*  He doesn't think that's it's not his role, but he can pass and will. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7245.88s)]
*  And by the way, the other thing that's under how well he goes to the hoop with [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7249.96s)]
*  either hand, uh, you know, that set up things for, for himself and other [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7253.72s)]

*  So answer, and I'm just, this is on a fly question that you ask. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7259.56s)]
*  And I'm my first, why not that with the guys you named, he'd be, [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7263.200000000001s)]

*  Taken more of them though, because if he knew there were three instead of two, [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7339.64s)]
*  he's taken 20 again. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7342.76s)]
*  It's like Larry. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7343.88s)]
*  It's like Larry people that anybody, my God, you imagine how many flourish today. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7345.28s)]
*  If you tell them, Oh, you can take 10 or 12 a game. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7349.52s)]
*  You know, Larry would embarrassingly would take four or five because it was, [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7351.88s)]
*  you know, you know, there and part of it, you know, he, he famously didn't want [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7355.8s)]
*  the three didn't like it. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7359.68s)]
*  And well, he's the, he's the more as the weapon. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7361.16s)]
*  It was like a, either to get the crowd going or to demoralize people. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7363.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7367.360000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7368.12s)]
*  He did as a psychological weapon more often than not. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7368.52s)]
*  And, and saved the spots. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7370.6s)]
*  And, and, um, but he would have, Hey, if you said, okay, if that's the game, I [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7372.12s)]
*  can play that game. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7375.88s)]
*  And he would have gone, he'd gotten better. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7376.68s)]
*  Uh, a lot of guys that can, you know, by the way, you know, who would have been [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7378.6s)]
*  ready-made for the game, I can still see them with, with, with the Jerry Lucas. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7381.84s)]
*  Jerry Lucas was bowing threes before there were threes from that six with that [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7387.6s)]
*  shot put thing he had, you know, I can still see him with legs extended and he [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7392.48s)]
*  shot it from here, not, not here. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7395.48s)]
*  He shot it from here, but you know, but the, anyway, Lucas would have been [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7397.6s)]
*  a phenomenal three point shooter. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7401.68s)]
*  Stretch for getting 15 rebounds a game. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7403.32s)]
*  Jerry Lucas. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7406.36s)]
*  Um, and computing is season's average in his head as he worked back down on [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7408.36s)]
*  defense, famously computing is we computing the shooting percentages. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7412.24s)]
*  He would go back down on defense. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7416.72s)]
*  Where do you put Janice in all of this? [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7419.0s)]
*  Cause he just got knocked out of the first round again. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7422.0s)]
*  He's spectacular. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7425.88s)]
*  Um, he's not, you know, now we were talking centers earlier, but, oh yeah. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7426.92s)]
*  I think the question now is going to be the rearrangement of the all time 10, [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7431.4800000000005s)]
*  you know, the all time pen, you know, how can you not include him in any current [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7435.96s)]
*  discussion about all time top 10 players? [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7439.76s)]
*  I can't, I can't ignore him. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7442.76s)]
*  I'm in sometimes in awe of him. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7445.2s)]
*  Um, I am a little annoyed that he is legalized, not just a Euro step, but in [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7447.28s)]
*  his case, a Euro gallop and it's, you know, that's this whole thing is this [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7453.72s)]
*  whole traveling thing. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7460.32s)]
*  I used to laugh it off, but it is epidemic. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7461.84s)]
*  It is, it is bad. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7464.8s)]
*  And the league seemed to care about it. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7466.12s)]
*  And, uh, and he's an exhibit a, you know, um, and, and how devastating it is when [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7468.88s)]
*  he can do it because he can go from mid court to the best, no more than from [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7473.76s)]
*  dribbles, you know, with, with ways that, oh, he's phenomenal. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7477.08s)]
*  Uh, I think in, uh, um, this whole issue with the buck, that's a whole, you know, [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7480.84s)]
*  that's, that's worth the, you know, lots of discussion. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7485.56s)]
*  Hey, listen, they, they give up a lot of assets for drew holiday and then [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7488.400000000001s)]
*  Dave Lillard and that's it. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7491.6s)]
*  I know I, and, and, and what could they possibly get and who could afford them? [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7493.84s)]
*  And can they possibly get back to them that would make it even remotely worthwhile? [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7497.56s)]
*  I, I, not that in my head, I don't have the scope of the vision of, uh, knowledge [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7501.2s)]
*  of all the teams, uh, individual circumstances to know who could possibly [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7507.32s)]
*  make a, anything remotely, a deal that the Milwaukee would ever want, but they [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7510.72s)]
*  have to start thinking about it where they're from here now. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7514.8s)]
*  It's so, you know, clearly it's over and where's Doc from here. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7516.76s)]
*  So I don't know what that is. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7520.4s)]
*  I'm hoping Doc comes back on my podcast. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7522.08s)]
*  Um, the Milwaukee has no first round picks that they control of their own [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7524.28s)]
*  over the next five years, which makes the tanking a little bit harder. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7528.8s)]
*  I got one more guy for you. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7532.16s)]
*  Um, SGA is another guy who feels like he easily could have existed in 1974. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7533.8s)]
*  Right. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7541.280000000001s)]
*  He's, he's a, he's a tremendous guard and he's menacing. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7542.08s)]
*  Um, you know, he's, he, I'm trying to think of, I can't think of, uh, you [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7546.6s)]
*  know, among all the great two guards, uh, it doesn't remind me of anybody. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7552.2s)]
*  No, I just see him as a wonderful all around shooting guard, um, period. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7557.48s)]
*  Uh, but I do, I love the idea, by the way, that that team has an all Canadian [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7561.919999999999s)]
*  backcourt and, you know, Dortson, he's from Montreal, and so I love that. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7566.12s)]
*  They go, I'm still waiting for Canada to make a splash in the world and [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7573.4s)]
*  the Olympics sometime soon, you know, I mean, uh, but, uh, they choke every, [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7577.639999999999s)]
*  every time they fall apart at some point. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7581.959999999999s)]
*  I know it. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7585.16s)]
*  They're massive underachievers Canada. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7586.36s)]
*  Uh, but, uh, you know, anyway, um, Oh yeah, he, he, I could see FGA, you know, [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7588.96s)]
*  in, in, in the 1970 floor championship series, you know, I can see him. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7596.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7601.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm absolutely positively. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7601.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7603.28s)]
*  He's, he's, he's no, I can come up with. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7603.84s)]
*  You have, okay. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7609.08s)]
*  See Stowa's the favorite because Vegas would agree with you. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7609.88s)]
*  I, I, I think that, no, honest to God, I mean, I know it sounds parochial. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7612.84s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7618.400000000001s)]
*  I still think that if everybody is fortunate enough to be healthy and [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7619.04s)]
*  able to bring their A game that the Celtics can win and will win if [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7623.200000000001s)]
*  they're a fortunate enough, but right now the variables, they're starting [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7629.240000000001s)]
*  with, you know, holiday, starting with men Brown and will somebody, you [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7633.04s)]
*  know, mess around with Tatum's wrist and poor Zingas, you never know when [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7637.280000000001s)]
*  he's going to take a misstep. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7641.5199999999995s)]
*  Never know. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7643.16s)]
*  You can't count on too many what ifs there for me to be totally confident. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7643.96s)]
*  But I'm saying if they show up in the finals healthy, you know, then, and, and, [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7648.759999999999s)]
*  and I don't care how, and I want everybody to be healthy. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7655.2s)]
*  Uh, I still like their chances. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7658.08s)]
*  Okay. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7660.0s)]
*  She's interesting though. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7660.44s)]
*  There's no question about it. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7661.24s)]
*  And I'll tell you who's, um, I'm, I've read about, you know, I mean, I was [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7662.599999999999s)]
*  paired for him, but having read about him before he ever set foot in college, [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7666.32s)]
*  but my God, Holmgren is good. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7670.04s)]
*  Home is good. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7673.88s)]
*  He's a, he's a, he's a very, very useful player and, and, and, and [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7675.12s)]
*  in Heidenstein, he's not a star, but he knows who he is and he knows what his [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7678.68s)]
*  job is and he, and, and he, he does it well. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7682.76s)]
*  And of course then, you know, the rest of the team, you know, fine. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7687.72s)]
*  And well coached, of course. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7691.28s)]
*  Um, so yeah, I like that. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7693.08s)]
*  And as far as, and Cleveland don't dismiss Cleveland, but when they got [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7694.76s)]
*  right now, they're doing it without Garland as well, we speak. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7697.68s)]
*  And, um, you know, I think they would, they're not going to go all the [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7700.64s)]
*  way without their full compliment, but, uh, uh, you know, they're good. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7703.92s)]
*  It's a salute, nobly defensive player of the year. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7707.400000000001s)]
*  Um, no, they're, they're, they're good too, but I still honestly believe that [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7710.6s)]
*  the Celtics, uh, have more assets ultimately than anybody. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7714.92s)]
*  I still think if they're healthy. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7719.08s)]
*  Is this Celtics team, where is it creeping up on the popularity rankings in Boston? [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7720.84s)]
*  Just, it just seems like people love, you know, they have a real history now with [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7727.0s)]
*  Tademan Brown, cause those guys grew up on the team, Porzingis is a cult hero. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7731.2s)]
*  Horford is among the most popular, uh, role player plus guys they've ever had. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7735.6s)]
*  How old and white are impossible not to like. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7741.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7745.52s)]

*  I've, I don't remember many teams like this on the Celtics. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7749.32s)]
*  And the, and the vastly underrated Luke Cornett, who's made it, who's been [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7753.0s)]
*  a nice adjunct to this team. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7756.24s)]

*  Well, this, this is a new generation. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7759.08s)]
*  You know, this is their team. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7761.08s)]
*  This is the Celtics have had, you know, four or five incarnations. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7762.599999999999s)]
*  Well, you go about the fifties, then you got the, you got the fifties and sixties [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7766.639999999999s)]
*  team, that's one, you got the Havelchuk-Cowans team, that's two. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7770.32s)]
*  You got the big three team, that's three. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7773.28s)]
*  You got the second big three team, that's four. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7774.96s)]
*  This is the fifth Celtic incarnation, you know, of greatness. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7777.12s)]
*  And, and, and a, and a new fandom. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7781.719999999999s)]
*  Uh, I see so many young people in the stands. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7784.24s)]
*  I, um, you know, uh, and it's terrific. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7786.24s)]
*  And, uh, uh, um, it is what a likable bunch, you know, I mean, uh, it, it is, [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7788.92s)]
*  it's just, uh, there's no polarizing players. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7796.2s)]
*  Marcus Smart, who I loved, but acknowledges his foibles to me and he and [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7799.16s)]
*  Jackie Bradley Jr were like Siamese twins of sports, okay. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7804.08s)]
*  And, you know, I love Jackie Bradley Jr today, you know, I don't care. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7808.72s)]
*  But, um, there's no polar, who's a polarizing player, unless, unless people [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7813.5599999999995s)]
*  want to manufacture something about, you know, like, oh, Brown, he dribbles in [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7819.32s)]
*  the traffic, he still doesn't have a left hand, all right, you know, uh, [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7822.599999999999s)]
*  that's as close as I can come. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7826.72s)]
*  And, uh, to any kind of a, of a, of a negative, you're right. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7828.68s)]
*  It's a beloved team and, and very well worth rooting for. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7832.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7836.8s)]
*  And it's something that, I mean, I certainly grew up with where everybody [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7837.08s)]
*  stayed on the same teams and then in the last 15 years, that kind of got blown [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7840.2s)]
*  up and people move around more and you have something like Yocca to Denver, [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7844.4s)]
*  you have Curry and Golden state or you're Brown and Tate them together [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7848.36s)]
*  in Boston with Horford. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7850.8s)]
*  And I do think it's more meaningful to the fan base and to the people at the [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7852.5599999999995s)]
*  games, they have real history with these guys, you know, and like we tried to [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7856.76s)]
*  capture some of that in the Celtic city about these generations, how they [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7860.68s)]
*  overlap and how people buy in and people overlap with the stars from the [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7864.84s)]
*  previous generation and does this stuff actually exist? [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7869.72s)]
*  And I do think those guys care about that. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7873.24s)]
*  I think Missoula cares about it. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7875.76s)]
*  You know, I think the organization cares about it. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7877.68s)]
*  It came across clear. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7880.92s)]
*  Well, it sure came across clearly how Garnett and Pierce spelled about it [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7882.24s)]
*  within their time. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7887.56s)]
*  How about Ray Allen? [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7888.8s)]
*  Ray Allen was like, I'm a Celtic. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7889.8s)]
*  He only played five years and he's like, I am a Celtic. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7891.24s)]
*  I consider myself a Celtic. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7893.56s)]
*  That did surprise me. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7896.080000000001s)]
*  You know, he was always kind of a little bit unscrutable as far as I'm concerned. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7897.92s)]
*  And that was good to know. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7901.92s)]
*  Yeah, that was really good to know. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7903.84s)]
*  No, it's all true. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7905.84s)]
*  So that, but did, oh, by the way, I'm going to give you, I can't leave you [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7908.160000000001s)]
*  without filling out and you'll, I decided Peyton Pritchard is a cross between [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7912.96s)]
*  Larry Siegfried and Eddie House. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7918.280000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7919.88s)]
*  I'm probably one of the only ones that's going to get that one. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7920.400000000001s)]
*  What's the Larry Siegfried part? [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7923.0s)]
*  Well, he's same rough size. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7925.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7928.4800000000005s)]
*  Close and feisty, tough. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7929.4800000000005s)]
*  He's a scrapper. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7933.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7934.84s)]
*  Siegfried was, I can hear Johnny most. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7935.32s)]
*  He said he's in his shirt. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7937.0s)]
*  He said he's in his shirt. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7938.2s)]
*  Well, I can see that Peyton's in his shirt. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7939.92s)]
*  He said, and he's good for one sneaky offensive rebound at night. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7943.400000000001s)]
*  And he's tough. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7946.56s)]
*  He said, not just this three point machine, he's a good basketball player. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7947.84s)]
*  And I love when he takes himself inside and finds a way to get the shot off. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7952.040000000001s)]
*  You know, and sometimes they block it. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7956.8s)]
*  Okay, fine. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7959.120000000001s)]
*  But he can, I love him. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7959.8s)]
*  That's the secret. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7961.4800000000005s)]
*  And of course, you know, the Eddie House part is self-evident, you know, the, [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7962.320000000001s)]
*  the three point, but that's the cross between the three and Eddie House. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7965.52s)]
*  And I love that. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7970.64s)]
*  And I think that's the secret. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7971.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7972.92s)]
*  But that's the cross between the three and Eddie House. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7973.16s)]
*  Before we go, you were, you were a big part of Celtic city. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7977.16s)]
*  So we did nine episodes. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7979.84s)]
*  We tried to cover 80 years of the team. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7981.12s)]
*  When you saw all of it laid out episode by episode, like did you had, like, [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7983.0s)]
*  what, what were you expecting? [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7988.320000000001s)]
*  And then how did you feel as you watched it? [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7989.6s)]
*  Well, it's best of all, you can't, you can't do everything as you well know, [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7992.64s)]
*  you know, there are a couple of things that I would like to see, uh, addressed [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7996.08s)]
*  at the time, maybe it was more thoroughly or, or at all, but, but I'm not remotely [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=7999.679999999999s)]
*  going to nitpick. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8004.4s)]
*  I thought it was a spectacular job. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8005.44s)]
*  I thought that, that they've got the essence of it. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8007.12s)]
*  They said you accomplished your mission. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8008.919999999999s)]
*  That's what I thought. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8011.16s)]
*  I could say they've accomplished their mission and, and, and then tied it up [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8011.919999999999s)]
*  with a wonderful bow with, with the 95 year old Bob Cousy saying how much he [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8016.12s)]
*  wanted the 18th championship to keep the continuum that he could relate to and [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8020.04s)]
*  be feel a part of going. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8024.96s)]
*  That was exactly what you were trying to portray, I think, in the spirit of that. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8026.36s)]
*  And, and, oh no, I thought it was terrific. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8030.92s)]
*  Um, I'll tell you, it was a hard episode was, was eight. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8033.36s)]
*  Oh, it was eight. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8038.2s)]
*  Was that was, you know, seven, but that was hard, you know, they lived when you [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8038.84s)]
*  lived through it, you know, and, and I'm sure a lot of us, uh, I know how I felt [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8043.92s)]
*  watching it and, and, um, um, it w it, it, it, but yeah, it's real. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8047.88s)]
*  It's part of the deal. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8053.28s)]
*  You know, those, those things happened and it was a, a down period in, and, um, [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8054.56s)]
*  and, and it was, you know, those things were just frightening, but it was just [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8060.68s)]
*  awful, uh, but bias and we didn't know, you know, I had seen, I was so excited [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8064.72s)]
*  about them because I happened to have stumbled. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8071.04s)]
*  I don't know what I was doing, Bill. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8073.2s)]
*  I have no idea why I was in Durham, North Carolina that particular evening and why [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8074.28s)]
*  I was, because I don't know what's going to feature or whatever I was doing. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8078.32s)]
*  I was there and Cameron North stadium the night as a Maryland player, he dropped [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8081.639999999999s)]
*  40 on Duke and he got my attention. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8085.799999999999s)]
*  I could see you went to that game. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8087.879999999999s)]
*  I was at the game when he got 40 at Duke. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8090.36s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8093.16s)]
*  And then twice, twice Mike Sosiewski has said to me that the greatest two [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8094.04s)]
*  opponents he ever faced in college were Michael Jordan and Len Vias. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8100.879999999999s)]
*  And, you know, and, and I know how excited Larry was. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8104.5599999999995s)]
*  Larry was going to come to curly early and work with them and play with them. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8107.639999999999s)]
*  And, you know, he was Larry was Larry was up to on him. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8111.2s)]
*  He knew he knew he was really excited about it. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8114.2s)]
*  The thing all this happened in a flash and, you know, 36 hours and 40. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8116.84s)]
*  It was just, just astonishing. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8120.28s)]
*  But yeah, we, we tried to hit that. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8122.44s)]
*  I mean, that episode, not exactly a feel good episode, but, uh, that [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8125.84s)]
*  nineties Boston, how dark it got. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8129.5599999999995s)]
*  Like the garden got knocked down bias and Reggie, the Red Sox. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8131.48s)]
*  If I said eight, I met whichever one encompassed the burden. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8137.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8139.8s)]

*  Okay. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8142.4s)]
*  Okay. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8142.92s)]
*  But, um, oh no, that, that group. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8143.48s)]
*  And I loved the Rick was when you got Rick, they're saying to Danny, how do [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8147.2s)]
*  you put together a big three, you know, and, or, and, um, well, here's how you [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8151.36s)]
*  do it, you know, you take your fifth round, you've, you're, you're number five [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8155.36s)]
*  pick and trade every way Allen. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8159.599999999999s)]
*  And, and now you could, you persuade Kevin or Garnett to come. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8160.84s)]
*  And now you've got a big three. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8163.5199999999995s)]
*  I'll tell you what I remember though about me and I'm on record. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8164.72s)]
*  I mean, I can't deny it. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8167.28s)]
*  I printed it. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8168.5599999999995s)]
*  That when they put the big three together, original, that second big three, I [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8170.28s)]
*  said, yeah, well, guess what? [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8174.72s)]
*  And you need a lot more than that. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8176.36s)]
*  I wouldn't trade. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8177.88s)]
*  I've, there's no team in the league would trade their next, their final [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8179.0s)]
*  other nine for the next Celtic nine that they got the worst support. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8181.92s)]
*  And upon which he went out and got Eddie house, James Posey, and then [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8186.84s)]
*  ultimately of course, PJ, which, which was a great story about being recruited, [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8191.36s)]
*  literally being recruited by the big three or points of thereof. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8195.8s)]
*  And so I was, you know, I was a skeptic. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8199.44s)]
*  I didn't think it was going to be enough, but never dreamed that would just come [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8202.880000000001s)]
*  together as quickly as it did. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8207.080000000002s)]
*  Those guys were so ready to do it, you know, to, to get it, to have a, they [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8208.400000000001s)]
*  recognize what the possibility was. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8214.12s)]
*  And they were so ready to do it. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8215.76s)]
*  And, and it was going to require the word sacrifice. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8217.320000000002s)]
*  It's going to require a, a, a balance of skills that they're going to have to. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8220.480000000001s)]
*  Calibrate. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8225.800000000001s)]
*  I love that word calibrate their skills to get the most out of it. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8226.6s)]
*  But ultimately, um, there was no, there's nobody like Kevin going in. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8230.36s)]
*  There's never, you can't, he's special in terms of the, you know, the, the [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8235.320000000002s)]
*  approach that he would as good as all around scale players, Pierce was [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8240.52s)]
*  and great shooter Alan was, you know, we all know that the ultimate key person [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8244.76s)]
*  on that whole thing to me to work was, was Kevin going in. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8249.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8252.72s)]
*  The sad thing you talked about earlier, how you don't judge players by [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8252.92s)]
*  championships, um, you look at KG, like just this completely misused asset [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8256.16s)]
*  in Minnesota forever, like gets drafted in 95, we had the 2007 he's won two [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8262.24s)]
*  playoff series and meanwhile, everybody's like, I think he might be the best [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8268.96s)]
*  player in the league. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8272.48s)]
*  Like nobody even knew how to put them in context. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8273.16s)]
*  Cause he just had such bad luck. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8276.4s)]
*  His owner gets penalized for the Joe Smith signing and they lose like [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8277.72s)]
*  three first round picks in a low, like, like Stefan Marbury just decides [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8281.68s)]
*  he wants to go to New Jersey. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8285.32s)]
*  And that happens. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8286.960000000001s)]
*  Like, it's just, there's 30 different things that prevented him from ever [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8287.720000000001s)]
*  succeeding in the NBA in the way he should have, which sometimes that's [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8291.640000000001s)]
*  how it plays out. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8294.960000000001s)]
*  I mean, I don't want to hold it against him unless I have a certain, you know, [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8295.68s)]
*  antipathy for somebody in a sense, you know, I, I like to hold it against him, [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8300.800000000001s)]
*  but, but, but if I don't care about them personally, um, and, and your game, [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8305.560000000001s)]
*  and, and, and it's like, you know, I think I got tired of people jumping on [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8310.04s)]
*  because he's never won a championship and obviously never will Chris Paul. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8316.400000000001s)]
*  It's not his fault. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8320.720000000001s)]
*  And once again, we get back to a little guy thing, you know, Chris Paul's [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8321.480000000001s)]
*  great player, great point guard, a class, a technically pure point guard, perfect [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8325.84s)]
*  guy, you know, in that job and the worthy hall of famer. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8331.0s)]
*  So I'm sorry, I don't judge him for not having won a championship anymore. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8336.2s)]
*  And I judge Stockton for not having won it. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8339.12s)]
*  They could, I hold Carmellone accountable though. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8341.160000000002s)]
*  I think they could have beaten the Bulls in 97 for sure. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8345.12s)]
*  And should have. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8347.800000000001s)]
*  Mrs. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8349.04s)]
*  Freak goes, he's not a guy you want in a big moment. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8349.400000000001s)]
*  I'm telling you, Carmellone was not, it's not, I think he's the most [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8351.76s)]
*  overrated great player, supposed great player in NBA history. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8354.84s)]
*  I do. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8358.36s)]
*  He's not just a top 10 forwards at all. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8358.92s)]
*  He's one of the main reasons I decided to write a basketball book. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8361.320000000002s)]
*  Cause I didn't want people 50 years from now to be putting him in the top 10 [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8364.160000000002s)]
*  because of his stats. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8368.08s)]
*  It's like, we got it. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8369.44s)]
*  We got to fix this. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8370.12s)]
*  Somebody's got to go on the record. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8371.04s)]
*  You'll love this. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8372.2s)]
*  I don't know for, there was a period of time when I carried in my wallet, a [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8373.8s)]
*  little list of 10 forwards better than Carmellone. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8378.6s)]
*  I swear to God, it was such a topic for me. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8385.04s)]
*  And it's not a bad humbling or anything like that, you know? [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8389.6s)]
*  No, that's not it. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8392.08s)]
*  But I just, all those thousands and hundreds of millions of points. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8393.24s)]
*  And, and I, I'm sorry. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8398.0s)]
*  I, he doesn't, um, he, he wasn't a guy you want. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8399.839999999998s)]
*  I'm going to your other guy like that was Elvin Hayes who ends up winning the title, [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8402.56s)]
*  but he's, wasn't he like benched in the fourth quarter when they [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8408.56s)]
*  actually won the title? [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8411.439999999999s)]
*  I forget the story. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8412.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8414.199999999999s)]
*  He was in the game seven. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8414.64s)]
*  He went out of the game for whatever reason. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8416.0s)]
*  And Mitch Kupchak came in and made the big play of the game in his, that he [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8418.279999999999s)]
*  wouldn't have been in the game if, if, uh, if Elvin hadn't come out. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8422.2s)]
*  So they wouldn't have won if Elvin hadn't been watching from the bench. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8425.480000000001s)]
*  That's yeah, that's for sure. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8429.240000000002s)]
*  And I loved it. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8431.16s)]
*  I'll tell you what I relished 1975 when the, when the, uh, Warriors swept them. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8431.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8438.0s)]
*  The rookie Keith Wilkes, six, six, one, God knows what 80, 90 outplayed [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8438.52s)]
*  Elvin Hayes, you know, four inches taller, 50 pounds heavier, you know, [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8446.880000000001s)]
*  and he outplayed Elvin Hayes. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8451.8s)]
*  I loved every second of that. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8453.039999999999s)]
*  Do you think Harden is the this generation's version of those guys? [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8454.8s)]
*  Harden? [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8460.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8461.48s)]
*  That's it. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8461.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8462.68s)]
*  Um, um, I can't stand watching him play. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8463.4s)]
*  And, and, and, and, and so to a degree I am, you know, uh, vindicated that he [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8466.96s)]
*  doesn't come up in the playoffs the way people think he should, you know, I just [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8472.4s)]
*  can't stand watching that dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble game. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8477.199999999999s)]
*  And, and I always say he must have bribed every scorekeeper in the league. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8480.52s)]
*  I don't know how there's assist. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8483.84s)]
*  I don't remember any of this assist, but they're there to the point, right? [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8484.96s)]
*  The league, right? [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8488.88s)]
*  I guess I, I still can't believe it. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8489.48s)]
*  I don't know how, but I mean, that's just my personal, you know, preference. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8491.56s)]
*  And I don't, I'm not a big Harden guy. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8495.36s)]
*  Where do you stand on Embiid? [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8498.72s)]
*  On? [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8503.56s)]
*  Joel Embiid. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8504.24s)]
*  Oh, Embiid, that's not what I said. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8506.199999999999s)]
*  The beast. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8507.36s)]
*  I want to like him very much. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8507.76s)]
*  I love his game. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8508.84s)]
*  Uh, you know, I mean, I love his skill range of skill and offense is tremendous. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8510.48s)]
*  And I've seen him in games where I just loved what watching played, but just [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8514.24s)]
*  something and, and he, you know, and he's, he's an engaging, uh, online [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8518.68s)]
*  presence, that's for sure. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkxi4-bsi8&t=8523.68s)]
