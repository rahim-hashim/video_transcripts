# Can Dame and Giannis Lead the Grim Central Division? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [October 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw)
*  The central, the biggest argument is the Milwaukee Bucks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=0.0s)]
*  They're over as 53 and a half. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=2.24s)]
*  They're plus three 80 to win the title. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=4.76s)]
*  They're plus one 75 for the conference plus one 65 for the one seed minus three [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=6.4s)]
*  60 for the division. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=11.84s)]
*  They added Dame Lillard. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=13.84s)]
*  We don't need to rehash that. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  We did a lot of podcast content on all of our podcasts about it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=16.96s)]
*  I don't think this team is deep enough to be a mid fifties wind team. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=21.04s)]
*  And I say that because as I'm looking at their depth chart and I see. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=25.92s)]
*  Guys like Connadin Malik Beasley, one of the Anacombo brothers, the kid, who's [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=30.0s)]
*  the rookie they drafted the number 38, the defensive was Andre Jackson. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=36.68s)]
*  Who the Yukon kid? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=42.4s)]
*  Middleton's there obviously, but I have no idea what he's come, what he's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=43.56s)]
*  thinking from a health standpoint. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  Jay Crowder. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=49.44s)]
*  I just think their perimeter defense is going to be bad. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  And I think it's going to cost them. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  If you're just thinking of them in the context of, can this team win [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=56.28s)]
*  like 56 games? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=58.96s)]
*  So house for me, it's an under. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=60.12s)]
*  I think the under is a little too high. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=62.0s)]
*  And I know they have, be honest on their team. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=64.0s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=65.52s)]
*  And it doesn't really reflect on how I think about their ultimate fortunes. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=66.56s)]
*  They're not deep and the right thing for them to do. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=73.44s)]
*  They're clearly good enough to go in 50 games. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=76.16s)]
*  Are they, do they care enough to go in 55? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  Does it make sense? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=82.76s)]
*  Are they going to have health, you know, sufficient to go in 55? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=83.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  I would. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=87.76s)]
*  Brook Lopez is 35 years old. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  Middleton hasn't really been healthy in a couple of years now. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=90.64s)]
*  It's not disrespectful to me to say that they're going to win 53 games and that's under. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=93.36s)]
*  I think it's really hard for a team that's going to be pretty strange defensively [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=97.2s)]
*  where they have like real strengths in some spots. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=102.44s)]
*  They have one of the two best players in the world. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=104.84s)]
*  And then they have like, this is a team that signed campaign and was super excited about it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=108.60000000000001s)]
*  Like we got campaign. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=114.28s)]
*  Cool. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=115.4s)]
*  I just don't see mid fifties for them. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=118.48s)]
*  What do you have, Rossello? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=120.44000000000001s)]
*  I'm going to go over just because look, you had four teams over 50 wins last year in the East. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=121.72s)]
*  Yep. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=126.44s)]
*  They clearly have the best chance to be the one or two seed besides Boston. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=127.48s)]
*  And, you know, over the course of factoring in. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=131.68s)]
*  It's a conference bet? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=134.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=136.12s)]
*  Well, I like this. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  There's all this uncertainty in the West, but like even with the bottom of the East, when I was looking at the over-unders, I'm like, you know, like Orlando is a good example. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  I know we're going to get to it, but you're going like, I really want to give them almost 40 wins. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=146.04s)]
*  I'm like, can I find 40 wins for this team? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=150.84s)]
*  Are they ready? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=152.6s)]
*  Are they there yet? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  Sorry, Sroot. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=154.32s)]
*  You know, I started kind of looking at like Detroit in there and then Chicago. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=155.2s)]
*  Like I started, this became a overplay for me because a bunch of ones where if it was like flip a coin, it was an under. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=158.68s)]
*  Totally reasonable sucking up wins from the Chicago's and the Toronto's and the. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=167.88s)]
*  Like the filling number is high. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=174.0s)]
*  Like I can't believe it came out at 49 and a half and now it's 47 and a half. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=175.24s)]
*  It still seems high. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=180.0s)]
*  Well, new coach, Adrian Griffin, they got rid of coach bud. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=180.68s)]
*  One of my favorite players of all time. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=183.72s)]
*  I know. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=185.08s)]
*  For the record. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=185.36s)]
*  The defense we'll see. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=186.60000000000002s)]
*  I think it's going to be pretty rough, especially the game piece of it when people haven't watched him have to play real defense. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  And I liked that he said his defense is actually a little overlooked. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=194.4s)]
*  I mean, just one time overlooked. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=197.84s)]
*  If you're trying to get 60, one time I'd like a guy to go. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=199.8s)]
*  I could do better. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=203.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=204.28s)]
*  I'm not good. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  I need help. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=206.2s)]
*  Like I looked and then I had to put on my glasses. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=207.11999999999998s)]
*  What's overlooked mean? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  Overlook. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=210.92s)]
*  I may have the word wrong, but it was just basically like, I don't get enough credit for like some of the stuff I do do. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=211.39999999999998s)]
*  And we're like, well, you don't, you don't. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=218.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=219.83999999999997s)]
*  I've never heard you do. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  You're an incredible offensive player. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=221.56s)]
*  House, will this be Yanis's greatest year? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=224.64s)]
*  29 years old. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=226.83999999999997s)]
*  Last five years, 29, 12 and six, 56% field goal. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=228.56s)]
*  But now he's playing with somebody who at least offensively is going to bring out a little extra for him. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=232.84s)]
*  Defensively is not going to have drew. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=238.28s)]
*  He's probably going to take a bigger defensive burden, but offensively he'll be allowed to actually take a bigger defensive burden. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=239.56s)]
*  I remember that stuff with bud too. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=245.0s)]
*  It's like, why wouldn't you just throw this fucking freak Jimmy Butler in a couple of positions just to see what happens. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=246.44s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=254.2s)]
*  We can't disrupt what we do. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=256.28s)]
*  It's only game 90. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=258.24s)]
*  We got to save them. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=259.36s)]
*  Same for the last. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=261.2s)]
*  Look, I'm not even saying it guaranteed like it was going to work. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=262.64s)]
*  Chances are it'd be pretty shitty having the ball, putting it on the floor and being like, I got to go around this guy. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=265.36s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=271.92s)]
*  What's give me your highest Yanis season. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=272.76s)]
*  That's not crazy stat wise. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=276.0s)]
*  So last five years, they averaged 29, 12 and six. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=278.72s)]
*  Last year he was 31 and 12. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=281.12s)]
*  Like, is it crazy to think he's like a 33, 13 and seven this year? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=283.52s)]
*  Shooting like 57%. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=288.24s)]
*  None of that matters to me. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=289.92s)]
*  I don't think he cares. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=291.08s)]
*  I don't think he needs to take 22 shots. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=291.96000000000004s)]
*  I'm just trying to figure out how impactful he's going to be compared to the last five years we watched. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=293.76s)]
*  Like what is the Dame bringing in the Dame agent to this? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=298.8s)]
*  What does this do for him? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=302.52s)]
*  Statistically, I think Dame's going to have so many secondary break threes that are wide open. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=304.44s)]
*  Cause I think that's one of the best parts of Yanis's game is getting going. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=309.52s)]
*  If he can't break through the wall, not trying to be political. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=312.88s)]
*  And kicks it out to Dame. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=317.04s)]
*  Like, you know, think of the other guys that have been taking those shots or missing some of them. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=318.48s)]
*  I also think the biggest thing is like, you kind of can see in your head, Middleton getting into his offense. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=322.72s)]
*  You can kind of see what Drew was or wasn't. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=328.88s)]
*  Like as much as I'm excited about Drew on the Celtics, if he was the guy taking the second most shots in a playoff game, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=331.52s)]
*  then that may not be what you want by design. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=338.32s)]
*  The fact that it's Lillard now, who we can just, you can just envision it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=341.04s)]
*  You can just envision him getting into all of this stuff. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=345.12s)]
*  I just think it raises their profile so much offensively. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=350.4s)]
*  So I don't have like, I don't think it's, hey, now Yanis goes for 35. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=352.88s)]
*  He could have his best season and still be lower in some of the traditional numbers. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=356.0s)]
*  So what if he goes 29, but the assists go up by two assists and he gets four blocks a game or five blocks a game. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=359.2s)]
*  Like those other areas. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=365.2s)]
*  Five blocks a game would be like, historically great. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=366.8s)]
*  Let's give him a three. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay, three. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=370.16s)]
*  Cause like five's a lot. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=371.04s)]
*  So what if it's like 27 and 15? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=372.32s)]
*  With like three blocks a game. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I'm trying to work out the cognitive dissonance between this team winning 53 games, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=377.04s)]
*  but him having, cause I really love him for the MVP odds this season. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=382.32s)]
*  I've almost voted him MVP each of the last two years. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=386.40000000000003s)]
*  I think he's the best kind of high favorite odd, six to one. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=390.8s)]
*  And I like Booker for the kind of the long shot. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=394.40000000000003s)]
*  As great as Jokic is, I feel like a bit of the belt conversation is a little dismissive, to be honest. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=398.16s)]
*  Jokic doesn't, well, now that's fair, but Jokic wants no part of any of these conversations. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=403.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=408.08s)]
*  But that's like for what we do. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=408.24s)]
*  And I know it can be like the recency bias of all this stuff, obviously. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=410.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=414.88s)]
*  But we're two rings removed from Janis. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=415.28s)]
*  I still think like this idea that there's no way like Janis could recapture the belt. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=418.24s)]
*  I think that's a mistake. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=422.96s)]
*  Who's saying that? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=424.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=425.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, Jokic has the belt right now. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=427.12s)]
*  It's pretty definitive, but I think Janis could grab it back this year. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=428.8s)]
*  So belt availability is how many guys? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=431.92s)]
*  Two? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=435.2s)]
*  I think that, I just think it's those two, honestly. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=436.40000000000003s)]
*  I don't think Tatum is ready yet to be in that combo and I don't really see anybody else. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=439.6s)]
*  He has to, Tatum has to like push himself into it. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=444.40000000000003s)]
*  We saw it for a bit, the beginning of last season. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=447.20000000000005s)]
*  And I think it can be giving up on that one. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=448.88s)]
*  Not him, but just like, not under these circumstances. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=454.0s)]
*  The playoff performance now, it's not just a cold streak. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=458.88s)]
*  This is kind of who you are. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=463.76s)]
*  This is what the stats are and what the performance is year after year after year in the playoffs. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=465.68s)]
*  This is kind of who you are. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=469.92s)]
*  I mean, look, I brought it up a couple of times, but like, I feel like I'm beat in a weird way [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=471.12s)]
*  because people like him so much that he hasn't caught nearly as much shit as other guys. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=474.88s)]
*  Well, there's always been somebody else to blame too. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=478.88s)]
*  It's like Ben Simmons, James Harden. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=480.64s)]
*  Thighball. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=482.71999999999997s)]
*  The coaches of the two Eastern Conference favorites are Joe Mazzola and Adrian Griffin. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=485.2s)]
*  Just wanted to mention that. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=488.88s)]
*  It's wild card for this year. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=490.32s)]
*  Cleveland Cavaliers, 50 and a half. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=492.32s)]
*  And it seems jarring. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=497.44s)]
*  It's like, man, that's high. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=498.64s)]
*  Well, they won 51 last year. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=500.96s)]
*  Well, the conference probably got a little worse. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=502.71999999999997s)]
*  I don't even have a pick yet. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=507.04s)]
*  I wrote under right now, but I might change my mind because I haven't decided. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=509.44s)]
*  I haven't decided yet. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=512.88s)]
*  I want to talk it out with you guys. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=513.68s)]
*  Um, strews. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=515.9200000000001s)]
*  They added. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=517.2800000000001s)]
*  Nyang. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=519.12s)]
*  Nyang. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=520.8000000000001s)]
*  The winningest player of the 2020s. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=521.84s)]
*  Most wins. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=524.88s)]
*  They added a Mobli's brother. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=526.8000000000001s)]
*  I don't know if that's a good sign or a bad sign. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=529.12s)]
*  He's actually all right. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=533.12s)]
*  I liked him in college. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=534.24s)]
*  There's some Amani Bates. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=536.4000000000001s)]
*  I can't believe how bad he was at the combine and then everybody loved him after. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=539.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there's some Amani Bates building. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=542.8000000000001s)]
*  Um, I guess my first question is, Hey, Evan Mobley. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=545.2s)]
*  It's time. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=551.0400000000001s)]
*  Let's, let's see something. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=554.24s)]
*  What do you got? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=555.84s)]
*  So you're off the Duncan profile. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=557.6s)]
*  I have a lot of stock. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=559.2s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=561.2800000000001s)]
*  Your grandkids are coming over being like, Bill, we need to diversify this. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=562.1600000000001s)]
*  It's like more AI, less Evan Mobley, more AI, artificial intelligence is where's that. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=568.8000000000001s)]
*  I know that Netscape was huge there for a little while, buddy. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=574.72s)]
*  Everyone else is buying crypto. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=580.24s)]
*  I was buying Evan Mobley. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=581.6800000000001s)]
*  Can you, can you make a 25 footer? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=584.0s)]
*  He, he needs to develop something else that is a go-to offensively. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=587.2800000000001s)]
*  And it's still at times feels a little. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=591.44s)]
*  Are you just the center and that's where you, where you should be playing. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=593.5200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=597.2s)]
*  Did you get exposed in a two center thing where you were trying to zag against somebody else? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=597.44s)]
*  Look, those four guys, they're on off stuff with Garland, with Mobley, with Allen and [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=601.52s)]
*  Mitchell was like one of the best groupings you'd have. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=608.16s)]
*  They were, they were second point differential in the East. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=611.1999999999999s)]
*  And yet you're right. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=613.36s)]
*  When I saw the 50 and a half, despite winning 51 games last year, I, I just was like, I can't. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=614.24s)]
*  I don't think I can. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=620.72s)]
*  They started at eight and one last year house 43 and 30 the rest of the way. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=621.6s)]
*  So the case would be Garland and Mobley are young. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=626.72s)]
*  I think we both really liked those guys as assets. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=630.24s)]
*  I remember those guys missed time though too. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=632.8000000000001s)]
*  Could those guys make a little leap? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=635.92s)]
*  What do you have as they had the expected wins based on their point differential was 55, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=638.88s)]
*  which just feels insane for a portion of the season. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=646.4s)]
*  They led, you know, in point differential and that, you know, everybody, the smart folks, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=650.0s)]
*  I'll point to that as a real good indicator. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=654.8000000000001s)]
*  And there's a defensive backbone with them that, you know, I just don't want to overreact [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=658.32s)]
*  cause they, Mitchell had a bad Nick series and Mobley was disappointing. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=663.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=667.52s)]
*  This is, that's the point. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=668.16s)]
*  The Mitchell thing I think is easier to get over, but they're the way that, but this really [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=669.12s)]
*  has more to do with the players than the regular season. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=674.16s)]
*  She's at this point, but like, after that Nick series, I started thinking like, wait, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=675.76s)]
*  is the problem here that you have two people that don't need like, you don't need to defend. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=679.28s)]
*  That a bunch. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=683.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=683.76s)]
*  The Mitchell Garland combo, like do those two guys ultimately make sense if you're trying [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=684.32s)]
*  to win multiple playoff rounds? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=687.92s)]
*  What else were you going to say, House? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=689.04s)]
*  Just that they're built for a regular season success. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=690.0s)]
*  And I think that they will come in with an idea motivated to like, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=692.64s)]
*  get that bad Nick's taste out of their mouth and get on with it. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=696.96s)]
*  This is another team that I'll be looking at for that in season tournament kind of thing, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=701.04s)]
*  those odds. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=704.8s)]
*  Cause I just think they're kind of built for that, that defense, you know, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=705.44s)]
*  they showed us in the regular season, that's like a regular season kind of defense. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=710.24s)]
*  So that's fine. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=713.36s)]
*  And they have a couple of moves that they can make. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=714.16s)]
*  I really liked the strew signing, not what they paid for it, but just for what he's going [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=716.48s)]
*  to bring to them because he's been in a lot of big games. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=720.08s)]
*  He's a guy who can take over a quarter and just make like four threes out of nowhere. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=723.04s)]
*  The big question for me is Mitchell not staying there longterm is probably the worst kept [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=727.92s)]
*  secret in the league. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=734.5600000000001s)]
*  And if it's not the worst kept, it's in the top three. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=736.24s)]
*  So at what point does that, does that put pressure on this season? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=738.48s)]
*  And at what point did the Cavs kind of admit that that's how this is probably playing out? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=742.8000000000001s)]
*  And does that change if they start out slow this year, the first, you know, how this goes, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=748.08s)]
*  especially with the information guys, Monday morning you wake up. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=752.96s)]
*  One of the information guys has a story to try to set the tone for the week that that then they [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=757.04s)]
*  can talk on all the TV shows about it. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=761.52s)]
*  It's like, this is going to be Donovan Mitchell's last year in Cleveland. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=762.96s)]
*  And then all of a sudden it's like, whoa, okay. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=766.56s)]
*  Everyone does the podcast. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=768.9599999999999s)]
*  We have all the TV shows about it and it's like the 48 hour cycle. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=770.7199999999999s)]
*  And I just feel like that's going to happen at some point with this team. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=774.7199999999999s)]
*  And the biggest mistake you could be making is thinking you're like, okay, see what the [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=777.76s)]
*  rant because for Durant, even if you were holding out, I hope that you could keep them, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=781.1999999999999s)]
*  which I'd still say you probably felt more positive about it back then than you would [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=785.3599999999999s)]
*  for Mitchell this year. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=789.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=791.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=791.1999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=792.3199999999999s)]
*  You're like, okay, if you're running the Cavs, like, can we let the asset walk for nothing? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=792.8s)]
*  Know what we gave up for it? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=800.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=802.56s)]
*  Or if we're doing that, like, are we preventing ourselves from a really deep Eastern conference [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=803.68s)]
*  run and it sits here today? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=807.4399999999999s)]
*  Like, maybe it all comes together. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=809.68s)]
*  Maybe it mobility has more offense. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=810.9599999999999s)]
*  Maybe they figure out how to stagger the two centers because maybe the two center thing is [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=812.4s)]
*  why their point differential, all the regular season stats are so good with them. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=816.0799999999999s)]
*  But when it comes to the playoffs, maybe it was just the next part of it. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=818.96s)]
*  But I know I kept thinking about that pairing going, this might be the problem that you have [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=822.08s)]
*  two guys that don't have to be defended. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=826.88s)]
*  So he's got two years left then player option, but his number is really low right now. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=828.8000000000001s)]
*  It's 32.6, 34.8 next year. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=834.1600000000001s)]
*  And it's going to be one of those things where he's going to sign an extension. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=836.8000000000001s)]
*  It's going to be for a massive number because he has the ONBA stuff. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=840.08s)]
*  And if that's not in motion in any way, then we're going to be on the clock with this. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=843.36s)]
*  So who knows how it's going to go, but that's the one thing that wears me. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=848.24s)]
*  I'm going to go over because of the conference. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=852.24s)]
*  I'm in over as well. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=854.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=855.36s)]
*  I just think there's going to be one dopey over team. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=856.96s)]
*  And I actually have the second one too that we'll get to in part three of the pod. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=861.6800000000001s)]
*  Chicago Bulls, 37 and a half, no Lonzo this year. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=864.96s)]
*  They are plus 172 to make the playoffs. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=869.2s)]
*  I think you can make a case. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=873.44s)]
*  They have the worst point guards in the league. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=874.48s)]
*  Zach Levine seemed like he was pretty available for most of the summer, but then he wasn't [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=878.24s)]
*  because the Bulls, there was no way they were trading them because they wanted a tongue for [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=882.16s)]
*  him. But yet he was in a million stories. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=885.04s)]
*  The Rosen's got an extension coming up. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=887.12s)]
*  They took care of Vuch. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=888.8s)]
*  House since 2016, 42 wins, 41, 27, 22, 22, 31, 46, 41. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=891.52s)]
*  Not where you want to be in the middle. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=899.28s)]
*  You root for a team that's been in the middle for two thirds of your life. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=901.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=905.12s)]
*  With the worst record year over year than that run. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=905.4399999999999s)]
*  But they're in no man's land. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=909.52s)]
*  They have a whole bunch of great trade assets. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=910.88s)]
*  They didn't do it last year. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=913.1999999999999s)]
*  Will this be the year? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=915.28s)]
*  40 and 42 last year. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=916.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=918.0799999999999s)]
*  They held the fort for reasons that remain unclear. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=918.24s)]
*  They're a little bit over the luxury tax right now, which is always a red flag for them [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=920.8s)]
*  because they've never paid it. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=924.24s)]
*  And the Rosen is a stealth, sneaky trade candidate this year. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=926.4s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=931.36s)]
*  Contract. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=931.8399999999999s)]
*  I think he's somebody that could fit in with a lot of different teams. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=933.04s)]
*  This isn't under to me. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=937.84s)]
*  I just don't think... [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=938.8s)]
*  There's just a couple other teams I like more in the East. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=940.16s)]
*  So I'm going to under 37 and a half. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=942.8s)]
*  House, you're under? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=945.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm under. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=946.16s)]
*  What are you, Rosillo? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=946.72s)]
*  Definitely under. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=948.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=949.36s)]
*  40... [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=950.8s)]
*  What do we got here? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=952.0s)]
*  40 and 46. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=953.28s)]
*  And remember two years ago was that weird hot, hot start. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=955.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=958.3199999999999s)]
*  And then you were like... [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=958.48s)]
*  And 500 for like the last three months. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=959.36s)]
*  The rest of the way. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=961.6s)]
*  And then there was more of a carry over. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=962.48s)]
*  I just think they have a lot of pieces here that could be trade targets. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=963.84s)]
*  So I would go under. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=967.52s)]
*  They had... [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=968.96s)]
*  Sometimes this happens with the NBA draft or they had prime spots in the draft, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=969.52s)]
*  the Kobe White draft and then the Patrick Williams draft. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=974.48s)]
*  And they probably took the right players, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=977.76s)]
*  but it was just kind of the wrong spots in the draft. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=979.9200000000001s)]
*  They're like one late here and two late on... [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=982.08s)]
*  They just never, never hit that next piece. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=984.72s)]
*  Levine will be an interesting one to see if... [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=989.6800000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=991.84s)]
*  And Orlando had two other picks too. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=992.0s)]
*  So that... [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=993.6s)]
*  Well, and that's the other thing. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=994.0s)]
*  They did the Vooch trade and one of them was the Franz Wagner pick [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=994.96s)]
*  and the other one was the Anthony Black pick. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=998.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1003.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1004.0s)]
*  Rough trade. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1005.28s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1005.9200000000001s)]
*  Not a lot to say about the Bulls. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1006.48s)]
*  Sorry guys. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1008.24s)]
*  It didn't bring a lot of Bulls takes. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1010.72s)]
*  Not a team I plan on watching a ton of on League Pass. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1012.48s)]
*  We always, Rosillo and I always talk about League Pass conservation. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1015.36s)]
*  First two months, especially, you're trying to learn as much as you can. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1019.28s)]
*  I'm not going to learn anything from the Bulls. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1022.5600000000001s)]
*  I know what they do. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1024.16s)]
*  It's like Levine, it's Rosen, Vooch. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1024.8s)]
*  I get it. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1027.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1028.0s)]
*  It was a fun first half of the season two years ago, man. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1028.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1031.2s)]
*  That was fun. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1031.3600000000001s)]
*  Like the place was rocking, you know, Saturday night game in Chicago. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1032.64s)]
*  And then it was like, are they really this good? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1036.96s)]
*  And it was like, no, they're not. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1038.72s)]
*  They're definitely going to beat Boston the first time they play Boston [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1040.56s)]
*  because it's just a team of guys who kill Boston. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1043.3600000000001s)]
*  Vooch kills Porzingis. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1045.92s)]
*  There's like, I'm just promising you Chicago wins that first game. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1047.76s)]
*  Pacers 38 and a half had an iPad accident. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1051.28s)]
*  So I had to go backwards last year, 35 and 47. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1053.92s)]
*  Playoffs plus one 26. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1058.16s)]
*  Is this the kind of frisky 42 and 40 Eastern Conference team that we grew up with as kids? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1060.88s)]
*  You're goddamn right at this. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1068.16s)]
*  That is exactly who this team is. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1070.24s)]
*  You've, you've personally rooted for seven teams like this. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1072.56s)]
*  I rooted for this team last year. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1075.84s)]
*  Fitting this kind of description. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1079.44s)]
*  Halliburton played 56 games. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1082.08s)]
*  So you're telling me I need four more wins with a full season of Halliburton. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1084.08s)]
*  It's over. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1087.52s)]
*  They were 28 and 28 with them. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1088.24s)]
*  They were 22 and 18 to start the season. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1090.56s)]
*  Yeah, they were a frisky, weird team. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1094.3999999999999s)]
*  Frisky. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1095.92s)]
*  They had like a five seed next to them and guys were like, man. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1096.3999999999999s)]
*  And just when, when I was like, I like this team anyway, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1098.96s)]
*  I'm excited to see what Nemhard does and all this stuff. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1102.4s)]
*  They go and they get Bruce Brown who have loved forever who they overpaid them, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1105.52s)]
*  but it's fine. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1110.24s)]
*  It was a short deal. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1110.8000000000002s)]
*  And then Toppin who it's just by rule has to haunt the Knicks fans at least five times next year. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1112.3200000000002s)]
*  But this is a weird roster. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1118.64s)]
*  We like Matheran. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1121.0400000000002s)]
*  He gets to the line. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1122.0800000000002s)]
*  What did he have? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1122.88s)]
*  Like six free throws a game last year or something like that. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1123.2800000000002s)]
*  He's like this hybrid offensive player just gets to the rim. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1125.44s)]
*  Now I would say it's a little alarming that ESPN's depth chart only has four starters. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1129.52s)]
*  So I don't know if there's a rule change. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1133.44s)]
*  Get IT on that. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1136.48s)]
*  And you like, you like Walker more than I do. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1137.44s)]
*  I guess we'll see with Walker. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1139.44s)]
*  I thought they took them a little high, but for what they need, they needed like, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1140.56s)]
*  you know, a banger stretch for it. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1144.08s)]
*  I get how it could work is he's a big guy that can initiate a little bit more offense. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1146.48s)]
*  I don't know how much they're ever going to let him put it on the floor and create on his own, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1151.92s)]
*  but Matheran is, is a real matchup problem for him. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1155.6s)]
*  So I just, I just look at the Halliburton numbers and go odds are at his age, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1158.8s)]
*  he's playing more than 56 games. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1163.36s)]
*  Get me to 70 games. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1165.04s)]
*  He's an all NBA possibility guy. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1166.24s)]
*  Four more wins. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1168.08s)]
*  He's a top 25 guy in the league. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1169.12s)]
*  He's a world stage guy. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1171.12s)]
*  We just went through this with Anthony Edwards. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1172.24s)]
*  The other guy that impressed the shit out of everybody was Halliburton. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1174.6399999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1177.84s)]
*  With good reason. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1178.1599999999999s)]
*  I, uh, this is a pretty easy over for me. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1179.6s)]
*  There's something weird with their draft too. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1182.6399999999999s)]
*  Um, oh no, they own all their picks. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1184.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1187.12s)]
*  Um, yeah, easy over. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1187.92s)]
*  And I think there's always one team when the conference is a little goofy like this, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1190.16s)]
*  there's always one team that kind of jumps in and gets it. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1194.0800000000002s)]
*  And this would be an interesting moment for Halliburton because I think he was somebody [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1196.88s)]
*  that team USA experience, I think, won over a lot of people too. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1201.68s)]
*  Um, and I thought it was one of the best guys they had. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1205.44s)]
*  I thought him and Reeves, like those guys jumped off the TV in those games. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1207.92s)]
*  What's the best buddy he'll trade for your Priscilla? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1211.28s)]
*  LeBron. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1214.0s)]
*  Sarudy wants him in Orlando. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1217.92s)]
*  For who? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1221.2s)]
*  Suggs? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1221.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1223.8400000000001s)]
*  You see Sarudy's like, Sarudy said if we get a shooter, look out. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1224.5600000000002s)]
*  It was exact words coming out of the elevator. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1229.28s)]
*  It was coming in hot for the pod today, but it does seem like the buddy healed [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1231.28s)]
*  situation is weird, but I think they just want to play Mathron and want to see what [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1234.48s)]
*  they have with him and Halliburton together. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1239.3600000000001s)]
*  But you know, they'll get one extra piece for him and McConnell, the sons were going [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1240.88s)]
*  after him basically all summer. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1245.76s)]
*  But I think they, if they want to roll the dice with num hard and try to trade [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1246.96s)]
*  McConnell, I think they would get something from him. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1250.72s)]
*  I would love McConnell as a backup on my team. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1252.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1254.16s)]
*  I wouldn't want him to be much starter. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1254.48s)]
*  I think a lot of people would. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1255.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1256.16s)]
*  He and Ties Jones love those guys. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1257.68s)]
*  All right. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1259.36s)]
*  So we're all in on Indiana over Detroit over under. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1259.6s)]
*  This is our last team in the division. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1263.92s)]
*  They're over under is 27 and a half. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1266.08s)]
*  This is just a weird team. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1268.8s)]
*  This is a top three weird, holy mackerel. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1270.64s)]
*  What's going on here with that? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1274.24s)]
*  The Kate Cunningham, Jade and Ivy combo. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1275.92s)]
*  They have four centers, Isaiah Stewart, Bagley, Jaylen Dern and Weisman. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1278.48s)]
*  They have the other Thompson twin. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1284.88s)]
*  They have Monte Morris, who all of us really like. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1287.6s)]
*  They have the artist formerly known as Joe Harris. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1290.16s)]
*  They have Killian Hayes. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1293.1200000000001s)]
*  They re-signed Alec Burks and Bogdanovich. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1294.8s)]
*  He actually had like a big Killian Hayes. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1297.76s)]
*  Like I was like, whoa, look at this. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1300.08s)]
*  Like one last push. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1302.4s)]
*  Final push. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1304.4s)]
*  Like, no, we had seven guys behind that river and they're coming for you. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1305.12s)]
*  And I was proud of Kevin for that one because I was like, shit, he's still, he tilts around. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1310.56s)]
*  Isn't he still only like 22? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1316.88s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1319.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1319.76s)]
*  No problem. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1320.0s)]
*  You don't care. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1320.32s)]
*  Well, they paid a ton for Monte Williams who coached his son's team that the last two years [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1322.0s)]
*  rolled over in the biggest possible spots. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1327.36s)]
*  I just didn't understand that at all. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1329.6s)]
*  I guess the question for me is- [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1331.04s)]
*  No, it's just simple. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1332.08s)]
*  If you're sitting in and you're an owner and you're like, hey, do we want to make [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1333.04s)]
*  Monte Williams the highest paid guy to ever do it? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1335.28s)]
*  You'd probably be like, I have a counter. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1338.32s)]
*  I think that's a no. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1340.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1341.36s)]
*  Good for him. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1341.92s)]
*  Great guy. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1342.72s)]
*  Everybody likes him. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1343.28s)]
*  This comes down to is Cade a franchise player? [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1344.24s)]
*  I believe he will be. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1347.36s)]
*  And I'm going over. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1349.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1351.6s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1351.84s)]
*  I just, I needed one of these teams down there in the 20s. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1352.56s)]
*  I needed to go over. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1356.48s)]
*  See, I have other teams in that territory going over. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1359.04s)]
*  So I think 27 wins, which is a 10 win improvement is fine. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1362.16s)]
*  And I'm fine with the under. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1365.52s)]
*  This team was 17 and 65 last year. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1367.52s)]
*  So this over would be 10 wins higher. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1371.2s)]
*  Now, Cade didn't play most of the last year and they also were totally happy to tank. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1373.28s)]
*  They got killed by the lottery. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1376.8000000000002s)]
*  Killed because they had 17 wins. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1378.64s)]
*  They go in thinking Wemby. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1382.5600000000002s)]
*  They, I think they left with the fifth pick. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1383.68s)]
*  Do they need Wemby though with all their centers? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1386.3200000000002s)]
*  I have a Thompson question for you. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1388.3200000000002s)]
*  Sure. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1390.24s)]
*  Is it possible they're just going to be fucking like awesome? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1391.7s)]
*  Like what are the, if you had to like rank the ads, like awesome, really good, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1395.14s)]
*  better than you think or oh no, which one would you go with? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1401.3s)]
*  Man, they're so gifted physically and they're huge. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1408.9s)]
*  There's been a lot of buzz about them. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1411.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1413.38s)]
*  Both of them. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1414.02s)]
*  And both of them are pretty good passers. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1414.58s)]
*  And Amen's shot may be broken. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1417.94s)]
*  So that's the thing I think that holds it back. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1421.94s)]
*  I'd say better than your thoughts, the best one there. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1423.78s)]
*  But like the way, the way they get talked about, like there's a lot of smart guys that [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1425.94s)]
*  seem to go, Hey dude, they're going to be ridiculous. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1430.9s)]
*  And I'm like, Oh, cause I just, it was hard for me to come to that conclusion [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1433.8600000000001s)]
*  with the stuff that I watched them playing last year. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1437.94s)]
*  I'm going to change my pick. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1440.34s)]
*  I went over for Detroit. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1441.7s)]
*  All in. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1443.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1444.66s)]
*  I'm over on Detroit. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1445.3s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1447.54s)]
*  See, this is why I win every year because you guys get seduced by a team with four centers. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1448.26s)]
*  Well, they were motivated. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1452.9s)]
*  They really did try. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1453.8600000000001s)]
*  They tried to get into the Wembe Stakes and there's, they have too many players on their team. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1455.14s)]
*  There's one player, all of us hold out hope for, and it's a different player. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1461.14s)]
*  It's Marvin Bagley, the third for Bill. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1467.06s)]
*  It's Wiseman for me. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1469.6200000000001s)]
*  I gave up for Marvin. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1470.82s)]
*  It's, it's Jontay Porter. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1472.02s)]
*  I like beef stew. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1473.94s)]
*  Give me beef stew. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1475.22s)]
*  I love Isaiah Stewart. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1476.18s)]
*  I was hoping the self-tax would get him. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1477.22s)]
*  I love him looking at this roster. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1478.66s)]
*  It's a, it's not, you know, if Cade is anything. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1480.3400000000001s)]
*  The only reason I remember the beef stew thing is it was one of those many days where I was [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1483.78s)]
*  frustrated with Hoops Hype where I was on the seventh link to a big stew food drive that he [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1487.22s)]
*  was having. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1492.3400000000001s)]
*  And I was like, can we get to a fucking rumor here? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1492.9s)]
*  It was like the sixth link in a row that he was coming out with some canned stew. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1497.6200000000001s)]
*  We're suddenly, it's just, you just need to buy Hoops Hype. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1501.7s)]
*  Just take it over. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1504.1000000000001s)]
*  You're like, wait, there's a new sheriff in town. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1505.46s)]
*  We're back to rumors. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1508.66s)]
*  I don't care that Oscar Krilenjkiewicz has been waived in Istanbul. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1512.1000000000001s)]
*  The Celtics have high hopes for Winying Gabriel. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1519.0600000000002s)]
*  That should not be the top story in Hoops Hype. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1521.7s)]
*  I'm going under and I think you guys missed a crucial point with the Pistons. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1525.3000000000002s)]
*  There's not a lot of bad teams. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1528.5s)]
*  And at some point we get to, there's like four teams who just look at each other. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1530.42s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1535.3s)]
*  We could get the first pick in the draft. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1535.7s)]
*  Let's just start fucking with this team and shutting some guys down. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1537.22s)]
*  I also think Bogdanovich is a legitimate trade candidate, especially if Thompson [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1540.58s)]
*  turns into anything initially. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1546.8999999999999s)]
*  So I'm going under. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1548.6599999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1550.02s)]

*  Golden State 47 and a half. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1559.46s)]
*  I went over. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1561.46s)]
*  You guys went under. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1562.4199999999998s)]
*  We were zagging against each other a lot in this one. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1563.46s)]
*  Sacramento 44 and a half. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1565.78s)]
*  All over. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1566.98s)]
*  I was surprised by that. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1567.78s)]
*  45 and a half for the Quippers. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1569.7s)]
*  All under. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1571.06s)]
*  Milwaukee 53 and a half. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1572.74s)]
*  House and I went under. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1574.18s)]
*  Rossello went over. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1574.98s)]
*  Cavs 50 and a half. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1576.9s)]
*  Rossello under. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1578.66s)]
*  House and I over. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1579.7s)]
*  Bulls 37 and a half. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1581.7s)]
*  Under, under, under. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1582.98s)]
*  Pacers 38 and a half. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1584.1000000000001s)]
*  Over, over, over. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1585.6200000000001s)]
*  And then the Pistons 27 and a half. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1587.6200000000001s)]
*  I went under. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1589.3s)]
*  You guys went over. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1590.1000000000001s)]
*  And that is part three. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1591.38s)]
*  And that is part two of the pod. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1592.74s)]
*  Part three will be the most fun one because all of our teams are involved, including House's [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1594.98s)]
*  Wizards. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1599.94s)]
*  House texted me that he couldn't believe the over under was only 23 and a half and he already [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1600.42s)]
*  bet the over. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1605.86s)]
*  And I can't wait to talk about it. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1606.58s)]
*  Part three produced by Steve Cerruti and Kyle Creighton. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKiF8jEUuKw&t=1607.94s)]
