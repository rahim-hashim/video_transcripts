# NBA Finals Bets with Cousin Sal and Joe House | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMRBNStb2eA)
*  Just seeing Joe House makes me hungry.
*  Just seeing Sal on a Zoom makes me feel like football season is starting.
*  How many days away are we, Sal?
*  94 days, 95 days, 94 days.
*  94 sounds better.
*  I really miss it more than ever this year.
*  I know. I got a new quarterback.
*  You have the last year with your quarterback.
*  Next year, your quarterback is going to be Gardner Mentschew.
*  House has a new quarterback.
*  We just had this this test drive this past week
*  of no basketball, hockey finishing up.
*  What am I going to watch?
*  What are we doing?
*  I'll tell you what we're going to watch.
*  I was watching Oklahoma with a walk off on the Softball World Series today,
*  and I was actually genuinely enjoying it.
*  I'm like, welcome to the summer.
*  We're going to have the Olympics, right, Sal?
*  We're going to have the US Open.
*  The Olympics. Thank God for the Olympics.
*  WNBA, US Open coming up next week.
*  House, I should remind you.
*  I'm aware. We'll be all right.
*  B.S. Did you win money on that Oklahoma walk off?
*  No, I haven't crossed the line yet on betting on softball,
*  but I think I'm emotionally and physically ready for it.
*  Yeah. The big thing for me is this summer for me in House,
*  the Olympic basketball is going to be, I think, out of control.
*  I'm going to have all kinds of thoughts.
*  There's going to be that quarterfinals where there's four games in one day.
*  We'll be all kinds of parlays.
*  We're going to talk NBA finals
*  and the gambling aspects of the NBA finals.
*  I know you guys have poured over all the bets.
*  Sal, I've deliberately not talked to you too much about this
*  because I was kind of hoping to rope you into a podcast.
*  I've talked to House a lot about it.
*  I know some of House's thoughts.
*  What's your biggest angle heading into the finals?
*  Well, my biggest angle is as much as I want to see like you and Henge disappointed,
*  I understand everybody in the ring, your staff gets a three point three percent
*  raise at the Celtics hang a banner.
*  So this is that in the CBA?
*  I didn't see that.
*  Did you see House?
*  You got that email from the from the desk of Juliet Lippman.
*  We all get a three percent raise.
*  Yeah, I think a signed camouflage hoodie from Rossello or something.
*  I don't know.
*  What about what about my my finals golf shirt?
*  House, you see that people, people listening can see that to me.
*  What do I got to do?
*  Twenty twenty two final shirt.
*  Hershey gave me. Oh, twenty twenty two.
*  And look at that. Yeah.
*  Even though we lost this finals, I'm wearing it anyway.
*  All right. What's your biggest angle, Sal?
*  Well, I want to ask you, what are you most nervous about?
*  Because these are three factors, right?
*  Like the Celtics are favored, maybe higher than they should be.
*  But not enough to take the underdog.
*  I don't think in fact, I think the three of us have exactly the same
*  pick in terms of a specific outcome.
*  But what are you most worried about that?
*  Poor thing is comes back, screws up the flow
*  that you haven't faced a closer like Luca or that home court
*  isn't a great advantage.
*  Well, I don't think home court is going to be an advantage,
*  so I'm not even worried about that.
*  The poor thing is like he had the press conference today and he was like,
*  I'm good. And he wouldn't say it was 100 percent.
*  He's like, I've practiced two days in a row.
*  And I think if there's a worst case scenario for the Celtics,
*  it's poor Zingas playing and then re-injuring something
*  and thinking that he's going to play.
*  And then that getting pulled away in game one or game two or on the road
*  in game three is something like that, because I feel like psychologically,
*  that would be a tough one.
*  The thing I'm the most worried about is that the series,
*  the more I stare at it,
*  I just feel like the Celtics should win the finals.
*  And all the history and all of the math and eight months of comparing the two teams.
*  And I just feel like we're we're doing this whole thing with well,
*  Luca and it's the best player in the series.
*  And but all of the evidence says they should win this.
*  And I'm thinking more like if they don't win it,
*  how am I going to feel afterwards?
*  House, because I'm going to feel like this is this amazing opportunity
*  squandered 22 is a little different.
*  They get to the finals.
*  It felt like they could have won.
*  But Curry went to a whole other level and the team didn't play well.
*  Like Tatum played bad.
*  That the shooting kind of went sideways.
*  Derek White had a really up and down series and they just weren't ready.
*  This time around, I don't know really what the excuse would be other than poor
*  Zingas or Luca just destroys them.
*  See, I don't like you using all this language.
*  Opportunity squandered.
*  What's the excuse?
*  I don't think that that's the right prism through which to look at this.
*  This Boston team in this matchup, in these playoffs,
*  in the era that we're kind of living in, in this basketball era that we're living in.
*  Because I think the true conundrum that this series presents is,
*  do you use your historic referentials as the framework for this thing,
*  which is a team like the Celtics that have gone 76 and 20,
*  a 20 loss team with terrific ratings on both sides of the ball,
*  with poor Zingas healthy through the vast majority of that.
*  That's a framework.
*  Or do you use the framework of this Dallas team,
*  which has charted its own course post deadline with,
*  you know, an identity that is very different from the identity
*  that that team possess all the way up until the trade deadline.
*  And just in this last month has demonstrated an identity
*  that I think rivals in terms of what Boston brings to the table.
*  It's a very close matchup, except for the hard thing of trying to figure out,
*  are we using the Celtics that went 76 and 20 or are we using Dallas for this last month?
*  Which one is the prevailing proper?
*  Yeah. What's the measuring stick?
*  So can I just say,
*  I hate it when House tries to sound smart and then does sound smart.
*  Really?
*  He's like, no, don't ever take him as being smart.
*  Prisms and frameworks and everything.
*  It's like, it's better when you fall on your face, House.
*  This is no good. This all makes sense.
*  I'm definitely going to fall on my face,
*  but this to me is the hashtag thread the needle series.
*  Like, how can we make money on this thing?
*  I said in one of our group chats, I bet on the Celtics to win in six.
*  I bet a little less on Dallas to win in six because it's a plus money odds.
*  But the real thing is the outcome.
*  We bet on both teams to win in six.
*  Of course.
*  He just proved that he's not smart.
*  I'm trying to win money.
*  I want to win. I want to win.
*  So but I think the series going at least, you know, the series over five and a half
*  games is my favorite bet that I think is the best bet.
*  Except I thought that in that Minnesota Dallas series
*  and then lost that right in the nutsack.
*  So I'm not sure.
*  Well, there's one thing, Sal, with the with the breaks between every game.
*  Let's figure out who that favors.
*  Thursday, Sunday, Wednesday.
*  So there's a lot of rest, which I think helps Porzingis and Horford
*  more than anybody would help on the Dallas side, because Lucas seems like
*  he's pretty good now, like he was looking pretty grim in round one.
*  But I thought by by Game 5 Minnesota, he was moving pretty well.
*  So I would say that helps Boston better. Right.
*  I think it definitely helps.
*  And I think back to the Porzingis thing, I think you answered that correctly.
*  That's the biggest thing, because when you haven't played for like months now,
*  like whatever it is, it's you're now more likely to hurt the team
*  in game one, at least than help. Right.
*  I mean, what's what's unless they're just going to ease them in.
*  He's going to get like 12 minutes.
*  The flow is not going to be there. Right.
*  So I don't know if you're planning on giving up game one or game two,
*  but yeah, it behooves you to have the longer rest.
*  By the way, the fact that we had a week off, I mean, Ronnie's going to be 37
*  by the time this damn series is over.
*  It's fricking ridiculous.
*  Pick 30, pick 37 or 37 years old.
*  Both, unfortunately.
*  Yeah. So that's what I say.
*  Yeah. The rest, I think, definitely helps your self-experience.
*  Well, I'll say this, if I was divesting myself and I know I've been careful
*  talking about the series, but I really don't want to feel like, oh, man,
*  I feel like I jinxed us.
*  But I'm just going to be honest.
*  I think the Celtics are better.
*  I think all the evidence says they're better.
*  And if they don't win this series, I'm going to be as bad as disappointed
*  in a Boston team as I've been in a long, long time because they should win this.
*  They really should have a better team.
*  Why should they? Why?
*  On what basis? This is the thing I've heard you do this.
*  Why are you setting yourself up for this?
*  I think Dallas is awfully close.
*  I think this is very close.
*  Dallas is a really good team.
*  But the Celtics, to go to do what they did for the last eight months.
*  And then to just lose in the finals when they have home court advantage,
*  to lose to Kyrie. Now, I like all the stuff Kyrie said.
*  And I think, like, I hope the people in Boston have listened to him
*  because I think there's genuine remorse and whatever.
*  The guy was in a bad place when he played for the Celtics.
*  And now he now he feels like he's in a different point.
*  Whatever. I'm way more excited to boot Luca and go against Luca.
*  And make Luca the villain in this whole thing.
*  I just think the Celtics are really, really good.
*  And I hope that they tap into it.
*  And the only way that they don't beat Dallas is if they miss a shitload of threes.
*  They get in a foul trouble over and over again in these games with their wings.
*  And I don't know, I just think they have a better team.
*  To me, Sal, the key with how to analyze Dallas is looking back at those three series,
*  which I think we all want on the Quipper series.
*  Yeah. And then OKC.
*  I don't think any of us did well in that series, right?
*  Because Luca kind of rope adoped us with how healthy he was.
*  And then he got more healthy.
*  That series is pretty close.
*  And then Minnesota throw that one out because Minnesota sucked and Dallas was great.
*  But going backwards, like you look at the Oklahoma City series,
*  for me is the series that I think is going to resemble the series.
*  They even though the teams are a little different,
*  the way, the way that OKC defensively,
*  the fact that they do have good scores at the end of games.
*  OKC had one. I think the Celtics have two.
*  I don't think Brown gets enough credit.
*  And they're just athletic.
*  The Celtics can be able to switch on defense.
*  They're going to be able to rebound better than OKC did.
*  They're going to be able to protect the rim better than OKC did.
*  But those OKC Dallas games were close.
*  And I just think Boston's a better version of OKC,
*  which makes me think they should just beat Dallas.
*  Does that sound crazy?
*  No, it doesn't sound crazy, but also just us analyzing this stuff.
*  It sounds crazy because we're going to be wrong about like two or three of the games.
*  You could really just like met to match ups and you can do everything.
*  But there is going to be a game where the Celtics go for for twenty seven from three.
*  There might be a game where they I don't really know what happened with Minnesota.
*  Like you want to say Celtics are a great defensive team.
*  I think they were third defensive efficiency.
*  Minnesota was one.
*  And then we saw three players just decide to not play basketball again.
*  Like you watch the defense was wasn't there at all.
*  I had like a player prop on Go Bears six plus rebounds.
*  So I was watching him the whole game.
*  He travels and I don't mean travel.
*  I mean, I think he goes a distance of seventy five feet per game.
*  It doesn't move at all.
*  So what happens to some of these players in this game?
*  You're going to be scratching your head for a couple of them.
*  But that said, you probably have the better team.
*  You know, you're you came a long way for this.
*  And I feel like I feel like karma is going to get Dallas a little for tanking
*  and getting Derek Lively talking about the tanking.
*  I like this. Seven hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine.
*  Not enough trade that in a second for what they got with Derek Lively.
*  Well, House, don't you think just on paper, the Celtics have the best kind of team
*  not to stop Dallas, but at least make them work for all the shots they're going to get.
*  And Mazzulli, I thought was really smart in his press conferences talking about,
*  like, we're not going to shut these guys down.
*  These guys are great players.
*  We want to slow them down, make it hard for them.
*  I know he has to say that publicly.
*  I think one of their goals in this series is take out Kyrie as much as they can.
*  And that's what OKC did.
*  Kyrie averaged 16 points a game in the OKC series. Well, why?
*  Well, they had Jalen Williams on them a lot.
*  They were throwing case on Wallace, Adam, right?
*  They had some rim protection with Chet.
*  And in general, they kind of moved the shots toward P.J.
*  Washington, who was unconscious all series.
*  And then Luca made some big shots and Dallas was able to win it.
*  But why can't Boston?
*  I'm not going to say they're going to take out Kyrie, but they they can put size on them.
*  They have rim protection and they have holiday and Derek White to throw on them.
*  What makes anyone think Kyrie is going to average 25 plus in this series?
*  I don't see it.
*  It's a strategic choice.
*  And Oklahoma City made that choice.
*  And then they lived with the the outcome, which was
*  P.J. Washington shooting nearly 50 percent from three and Derek Jones, Jr.
*  shooting well from three.
*  And Josh Hardy shot reasonably well.
*  Like they left the corner three to Dallas as as the option.
*  And they said, we dare you, second tier players, to go knock these down.
*  And then they did. And that's why they lost the series.
*  So it's a choice for sure for Boston.
*  And I think Dallas is perfectly fine with the idea of Kyrie
*  in a playmaking role as opposed to a scoring role.
*  And the reintroduction of Maxie Klaver should should be meaningful.
*  Right. That's a big guy who could do a small ball with him.
*  Yeah. And he and he's very comfortable from that three point line.
*  It's an additional three point threat that Dallas, I think, would be like, oh,
*  so you're going to take away Kyrie by using this defensive effort in that direction.
*  Well, here are all the guys on the perimeter that were pretty comfortable
*  letting shoot and we're going to live with that three ball.
*  Is it possible Minnesota just sucked in the last series?
*  I know Dallas is really good, but man, you think like one of the things
*  you're going to have to do, your top two guys are going to have to match
*  the top two guys on Dallas, which will be they'll be in the 50
*  plus range combined.
*  I would say minimum, even if Kyrie is like 16, 18 game, Lucas still going to be.
*  Low mid thirties.
*  So you have to somewhat match that the Celtics all year.
*  Tatum and Brown have been in the 50 to 60 range, right?
*  Minnesota and towns towns was just an abomination in that series.
*  It means eight for 33 from three and then ant stats are worse.
*  And they just couldn't match the points.
*  And that became this eight point cushion for Dallas every game, which
*  I just think Boston's going to be able to get close to matching those points.
*  And then you throw in the other guys and it gets a little easier.
*  But is, is basketball that simple, Sal?
*  Just like, Hey, our two guys need to match the other two guys point total.
*  And we have a better team across the board.
*  Other than that.
*  No, of course it's not that simple.
*  None of the series resembled that we saw sweeps and, uh, when we saw
*  what the Minnesota one went five, but you know, you could have lost
*  two games against Indiana.
*  You could still be playing that.
*  Probably should have.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think like, if, all right, let's, let's put it this way.
*  If you're down two to one after three games, who are you MFing
*  the most on the Celtics?
*  Probably Missoula, right?
*  It's probably like, why the hell are we putting Hawford on, on Luca?
*  We're like, what the hell, what are we doing here?
*  Why is this, why are we not figuring out the matchups?
*  Why is he playing poor Zynga so much?
*  He's obviously not ready.
*  Why do you play Hauser this much?
*  Yeah.
*  I'm probably mad at Missoula if we're down two one.
*  Yeah.
*  So I think the coaching mismatch, although slight could, could make a
*  difference in, in a overall matchup.
*  That's pretty close.
*  Hold on.
*  We're not giving Jason Kidd pronounced advantage in a coaching.
*  Come on.
*  Little bit.
*  The guy was almost getting fired for a year and a half.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, this Dallas team has not lost consecutive playoff games this entire run.
*  They have adjusted and adjusted and adjusted, and he's been up against
*  coaches that we are prepared to give flowers, dying all one coach of the year.
*  I think he did a pretty good job against that dude.
*  Chris Finch.
*  He out coached Agnon.
*  The number one defense in the entire NBA.
*  He was fucking in the second row limping around.
*  Was his brain crippled?
*  Stuff they did was pretty, pretty mentally crippling.
*  Like, Hey guys, Lucas hot, maybe setting a second guy out of him in game five.
*  Flames are shooting out of his ass.
*  You're just staring at him.
*  What are you guys doing?
*  I don't know.
*  Like, like I felt like they could have gotten towns going a little bit more.
*  The Kyle Anderson piece where they didn't really play him for a couple of games.
*  I'm just, I'm looking at this big picture.
*  This has been a seven year Odyssey with Brown and Tatum all leading to this
*  finals in this moment, right?
*  And it's like, great.
*  Lucas is an awesome player, right?
*  He's fucking incredible.
*  But that they should still be able to beat a team that has one awesome player and
*  then one really good offensive player and a bunch of role players.
*  Like this team over and over again was beating everybody in the league.
*  And now it's like, Oh, it's the finals.
*  Whoa, this is too much for us.
*  Like these guys have been in all of these huge games, the Celtics.
*  You don't have the excuse of 22 of like, Whoa, happy to be here.
*  Oh, Tatum so young.
*  Oh my God.
*  And Derek White just got here.
*  They don't have any excuses anymore.
*  Like, I'm never going to have a better chance.
*  I'm starting to get it.
*  I'm starting to get it, house.
*  It's true.
*  They really aren't.
*  They had the easiest run in the playoffs.
*  You got, you know, you had really, you had Butler didn't finish the series.
*  You had Mitchell didn't finish the series.
*  You had Albert and didn't finish the series.
*  And Bede was hurt.
*  So then Steve went down.
*  We skipped Jannison and Bede.
*  Or Jokic.
*  Yeah.
*  Like this is, I don't know, this is Boston Bruins-esque and that's like, Oh my God.
*  What, what the hell can go wrong now?
*  I don't know.
*  There's two things going on here though.
*  First of all, remember last June, remember how much content this very podcast got out
*  of the idea of should the Boston Celtics bring Jalen Brown back?
*  Should they pay him that giant amount of money?
*  What have the Celtics done?
*  What that, what's that twosome done?
*  This podcast got a ton of mileage out of that.
*  Uh, at the end of last year.
*  What did I always say?
*  Don't break them up.
*  Well, you, you got there.
*  It took a little while.
*  It took some, I never wavered on that.
*  Uh, I don't know if there's never wavered on that.
*  There might be some receipts.
*  We'll look for some wavering.
*  I think there was some wavering.
*  I just want to break those guys away.
*  The only thing that made sense to me is if this season didn't go perfectly with the
*  amount of money they're going to pay Brown.
*  And this is another piece of why this season is so make or break.
*  Tatum's going to get a $315 million contract extension in July.
*  Right.
*  He's eligible for it.
*  He's going to get it.
*  So now you're gonna have two guys making 600 million plus on top of some of the
*  other pieces with this, whatever the second apron, I don't know what's going to,
*  what's going to look like post media deal, but they're probably not going to get a
*  chance to stack a team with six really high quality guys like this after next season.
*  So to me, it's a two year window.
*  Well, he deserves it and it's worth it because the Celtics, if everybody's
*  healthy are effing awesome.
*  What happened after resigning Jalen Brown was Drew Holliday fell in your
*  effing laps and Chris up for Zangus fell in your ear, effing laps.
*  And that made this incredible team that won 76 games, even with the
*  annual injury to poor Zangus.
*  The problem in trying to figure out what the hell's going to happen here and why
*  I keep trying to urge you to be cautious with the, like, make or break.
*  How can I say more cautious?
*  You keep saying squandered opportunity.
*  Uh, this is a make or break.
*  I don't think that's proper because this team, this Celtics team has not played a
*  really competitive basketball game since when, when was the last time they played
*  the team with its full compliment?
*  I thought those two Indiana games in Indiana were super helpful.
*  That team was playing really well.
*  Like however you feel about Indiana, that team was playing well.
*  And Nemhard was out of his mind.
*  Like he was making every kind of shot.
*  They were playing really hard.
*  They're on the road.
*  They had to come back from behind in both games.
*  And I, it's the kind of game like they, they would blow those games during the
*  year every once in a while.
*  So that I feel a little better.
*  I like it.
*  He's putting all the pressure on himself.
*  And I think it's genuine too.
*  I've been around.
*  Why do it myself?
*  How do I have pressure?
*  I'm not playing.
*  You are sitting next to my dad, giving him, giving him coke.
*  No, you're playing all these games.
*  You're flying to Dallas.
*  This is great.
*  We got to fly to Dallas.
*  All right.
*  So you guys impartial observers houses, a Washington fan, salad.
*  You don't even have a basketball team.
*  You're just like, you're like, uh, you just travel around the earth, betting
*  on basketball games like Kung Fu.
*  I, I look at it through a different, what'd you say?
*  A lens, a prism.
*  I don't know how, but yeah, what's house a smart guy term for that?
*  I don't need these games to be close like you guys do.
*  And that's why I love the bet.
*  Both sides minus nine and a half, which is by the way, up 16
*  units in the playoffs took a bit of a hit last round.
*  Well, it's thanks to your team by losing.
*  Can you explain that?
*  Cause we haven't talked about that on this podcast.
*  So explain what you were doing.
*  Sure.
*  It's easy.
*  Just bet both teams in each game minus nine and a half points.
*  So you're definitely going to lose one of them, right?
*  Cause no one's ever, there's never been a game where both teams have
*  won by 10 or more points, so you're going to lose one side.
*  But eventually the payout and the odds in your favor is going to be so great.
*  If Miami beats Boston in Boston by double digits as a double digit
*  underdog, if Cleveland beats Boston in Boston by double digits, you're
*  talking like this is like six to one you're getting out of bet.
*  So that's something like crazy.
*  Those two that I mentioned are probably like 11 or 12 to one.
*  So if you just stay with it, you're good.
*  And I have something else.
*  Once we go over game one things that I like too, but yes, that's a, that's
*  kind of how, and the math closed things out with a plus four 40 double digit win.
*  All right.
*  So give me both of you guys who just follow basketball, give me your Tatum
*  takes cause he's obviously not one of the best four players in the league, but
*  he's at the top of that next level.
*  He's been a first team on NBA guy.
*  Is there a real it?
*  Cause I think the best bet, I'll just spoil it now.
*  And a couple of people have mentioned this.
*  It's on Fandl Celtics and six with Tatum to win the MVP is plus six 50 on Fandl.
*  And if you use that profit boost token that they have on Wednesday, that you
*  can get 30% bump on that, um, to me, this is a Tatum series.
*  And even like you'd think that 42 club, I always mentioned, like in the playoffs
*  where he hasn't shot that great, he's still been 26, 10 and six for the entire playoffs.
*  Right.
*  The list of guys heading into the finals who have been 25, 10 and five guys.
*  I think he's like the fifth guy ever.
*  And against this Dallas team, I think he has really good match-ups against them.
*  He's going to be able to rebound.
*  I think he's going to shoot.
*  Um, I think he's going to be able to hopefully hit some threes and get to the
*  line and do all the stuff he's done all season and he's in a position, I think,
*  to vault up a level, but how do each of you feel about Tatum watching from afar?
*  What do you think?
*  So where do you have them?
*  What quarterback is he?
*  Oh, is he not quite Joe burrow?
*  Is he like, is he better than that Prescott?
*  Shit.
*  He could be my guy.
*  He really could be my guy.
*  Come on.
*  Right.
*  He could, I don't know why.
*  I mean, I guess he's gotten technically, I'm sorry.
*  Has that Prescott made a super bowl?
*  Call them NBA Brock Purdy.
*  Yeah.
*  That's, that's, that's where he just, you know, that's just him getting in it.
*  I'm not buying that.
*  He, what did he call Belichick?
*  I don't know.
*  He had a similarly derisive thing for Belichick.
*  He should have done the road.
*  He should have done the Brady roast.
*  Yeah.
*  All right.
*  Go ahead.
*  So I, I, well, I'm a Brown, I'm a jail and Brown guy and someone needs to
*  explain to me why he is, I go the other way plus set a 700 now to win MVP.
*  Now we won the MVP of the Eastern conference finals.
*  Maybe you could help me because I know they get like an athletic rider and they
*  get somebody from, from the local papers of the teams playing, and then they have
*  like the dollars Birks who's covering and it was like nine, he won five to four.
*  Do you get a vote in this?
*  No, I think it's the people that are there.
*  Um, right.
*  But there's like a, a few others.
*  So it's similarly, I think it's going to be a similar nine committee of nine.
*  So I have a theory on this.
*  I haven't told you guys this why his odds, cause I think his odds should be like
*  Jaylen's side should be like three to one plus three, 25, something like that.
*  I think that I think Vegas is factoring in the foul trouble house.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Because I think Jaylen's going to have the biggest defensive burden in the
*  series.
*  Cause they need, if it's a choice between who do we have to keep on the court to
*  keep the offense running so much of it runs through Tatum.
*  And that was one of the reasons he even got the four Eastern conference vote for
*  MVP, even though he didn't shoot that well, she was doing so many things.
*  Like he's basically becomes point forward for them.
*  A lot of the offense runs through him.
*  He's their best rebounder.
*  Um, and they kind of need to have them out there.
*  And Jaylen has taken on the bigger defensive burden, which in this case,
*  means he could be guarding Kyrie and Luca at various times.
*  And I wondered, is that, would that make sense why his odds are off?
*  Cause they feel like he's going to get in foul trouble.
*  Well, I was going to posit the theory that having just won the conference
*  award, there's no chance that he's going to win a MVP of the finals that that,
*  that was the one that he's going to get.
*  And that the, the voters having, you know, just, just rewarded him.
*  Are not, unless he has an absolutely dominant performance, which doesn't seem
*  like it's in the cards, like he doesn't have enough usage if Tatum, if Celtics
*  use Tatum the way they want.
*  So I think to me, there's only, it's a two horse race for, for MVP.
*  Jaylen has to be in there.
*  I do think he could just have a really good series and, and his defense and
*  people, cause I think the people that watch the Celtics think he's better
*  than the outside world just because of his two way stuff.
*  He really went up a level this year.
*  I've been super impressed by him.
*  Um, let me just say this.
*  One of the votes Tatum got was from the Indianapolis star writer.
*  So that, I mean, they tell you who voted and there's nine of them in
*  Montemps and Darce Burke and Carlisle.
*  Well, they all, so I think most of them will be back, but I don't know.
*  Is it possible?
*  He's not as likable Tatum as you want him to be because he was like minus
*  1200 to win this award at halftime of game four.
*  So I don't know what the hell happened.
*  I don't, he just didn't, I didn't think his shooting was good enough.
*  Do you think Lucas plus two 10, but if Pat McAfee calls him a white bitch
*  before game time, would that go up or down?
*  So how does that, do the finals ads get affected by that?
*  Uh, I'm just going to, he just apologized for that.
*  He's apologized.
*  Yes.
*  Proactively for calling Luca a white bitch.
*  Before he even does it.
*  Yeah.
*  That's smart.
*  I happened to watch that apology this morning.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Teared up a little bit.
*  Yeah.
*  It was emotional stuff.
*  Mullet guy.
*  Number two was tearing up.
*  It was, it was really great.
*  Lucas plus two 10, which raises the old argument of if you're going to bet the
*  Mavericks, why not just bet Luca?
*  The odds are slightly better, which we go through every year with the
*  quarterback in the super bowl.
*  I don't know.
*  I'm Sal.
*  I know you keep track of this.
*  It's pretty, yeah.
*  He's like, if you're going to, if you like the chiefs bet my homes, if you
*  like the Mavericks bet Donchich, I think that's the way to go pretty much.
*  But I don't think football's ever seen an Andre Iguodala win before at a
*  hundred to one, right?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, this, this year that would be drew holiday or Derek white.
*  And there's a Derek, Brian Barrett loves the Derek white 35 to one odds,
*  because, um, from like, if you go back and you watch the two Mavericks,
*  Celtic games, like they really attack Kyrie in the January game.
*  Right.
*  And they, you know, you look at Minnesota, Mike Conley is, you know, in
*  his mid to late thirties at this point.
*  It was like, let's run our offense from Mike Conley and have them attack Kyrie.
*  They didn't really have that.
*  He didn't have to guard SGA in the other series.
*  Okay.
*  See had giddy who nobody had to guard, you know, and then the Clippers
*  Kawhi was hurt so they could kind of focus everything on Harden and George.
*  In this series, Derek white could slip through the cracks and they
*  could run a lot of stuff with them.
*  He could hit a bunch of threes.
*  35 to one seems a little crazy house.
*  If that was the, if that's your Iguodala of this series, like that, that would
*  involve Tatum that shooting great, Jalen getting in foul trouble and then
*  having to look at a third Celtic.
*  I don't like it.
*  I'm not going in that direction.
*  I, we're, I feel like it would be your Iguodala pick then nobody, there are
*  no Iguodala picks that's, I don't, I think we're past that now.
*  I think we're at the point we have between you're only star power.
*  That's it.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  Right.
*  Yes.
*  So you don't like he won't get a 500 to one.
*  He won't be able to fill up the stat sheet enough.
*  I mean, if you're saying Derek lively and Derek white have the
*  same basic odds for the thing.
*  No, Derek white has better odds.
*  Well, he got it because he was defending LeBron for a lot of it.
*  Right.
*  Like that, that has to be a Derek white took out Kyrie and then hit a bunch of
*  threes, that would be the recipe.
*  What about the theory that Dallas hasn't had to play a five out team yet?
*  Because the Celtics have that they can just spread the floor with the five
*  three point shooters, which means the rim protectors, one of them has to come
*  out and guard somebody and then the lane opens up and then, um, but I doubt
*  it would involve poor Zingas playing well and hitting threes and then Horford.
*  Not looking like he's 30 years old houses making faces.
*  Well, only because wasn't that supposed to be the Oklahoma city team?
*  No, cause they couldn't cause giddy.
*  They, well, they just didn't have to worry about giddy ever.
*  They, they weren't supposed, they were supposed to be, but they weren't
*  because one guy sucked.
*  He sucks sucked and he really shouldn't have been on the floor under any
*  circumstances coach of the year.
*  Mark Daniel didn't figure it out.
*  Apparently.
*  How's that?
*  And shots of dags.
*  Well, I mean, they played like a team that was brand new to the playoffs and brand
*  new to the adjustments that the playoffs require, but, um, you know, that the
*  whole thing boils down to it.
*  We'll know like, I think in the first four minutes, how's the Zinger movement?
*  Show me his lateral movement.
*  How does he get from three point line to three point line?
*  How will he go in and try and grab a rebound?
*  Like that will know.
*  I think immediately how confident he is, what his mobility looks like.
*  And that will chart the whole thing.
*  I honestly feel like I want to live bet the series price within the first four
*  minutes of the camp of game one cause that's what I wanted.
*  I think because it's all up to like, if he's moving and he looks good and they've
*  been rope a doping, oh, we're not sure he might come back.
*  Oh, you know, we're being cautious.
*  If he's out galloping up and down the floor and looking like the dude for the
*  majority of that Celtics run the most efficient offense of the season in the,
*  in the NBA, then it's like, oh, well, okay.
*  The Celtics are ready.
*  Uh, but I'm not, let's see it.
*  I need to see it.
*  Well, the case for the rope a dope would be he was going to play in game five in
*  the Indiana series, if that series wasn't sweep.
*  And that would have been over a week ago.
*  So that's why I'm wondering if they're being a little coy with this and the
*  injury he had, which is a three to four week injury.
*  Now, granted he's tall, he's got long legs.
*  He's had some mystery with knees and below injuries and the be careful anyway,
*  but 37 days feels like if you're not recovering from that injury in a month and
*  a half, basically, then that, that feels like that's maybe a little bit.
*  Yeah.
*  Those are similarly, those are terrible odds for him to win MVP 33 to one.
*  Like he's a better bet than Derek white or drew holiday or some of those other
*  guys we mentioned, like, yeah, what would he have to do?
*  Poor thing is to win MVP.
*  I mean, he'd have to go 25 and eight every game and I don't see it.
*  I also don't think he's going to play enough minutes.
*  Yeah.
*  Don't, don't pull him anytime.
*  Any games not close.
*  That's another thing with this Celtics team, which Sal, you know, from the minus
*  nine and a half, it's like, they, they have killed teams.
*  There was crazy stats from them during the season of, you know, like 50 plus
*  wins that were 10 points or more.
*  And just in, even in the playoffs, like Brian Barrett talked about this on his
*  podcast, like that Miami series, which everyone was like, wow, how'd Miami get a
*  game off the Celtics?
*  If you actually look at the overall stats, that was one of the biggest
*  destructions of a five game opponent that's been in the last, like two
*  decades of the league, like they killed them in every game, except for the one
*  that lost take the 16 and a half night.
*  Well, here's the other thing I'll say.
*  If you don't love this minus nine and a half each way, Fandl offers.
*  Like Celtics, like say for game one trail by 10 or more and win the game at plus
*  four 30, and you can take the other side, Mavs trail by 10 or more and when the
*  game at plus 700 and often times, I say, I should take that every game.
*  You take it every game.
*  And sometimes both teams have been down by 10 points.
*  And then you're just sitting there like, all right, you beat me to it.
*  It's impossible to lose.
*  I would bet both.
*  I mean, you can make fun of me.
*  I would just bet both.
*  Take them both. Why not?
*  House, were you satisfied with how Dallas' opponents attacked
*  Luca and Kyrie on defense?
*  And I know Kyrie's defense was better than usual.
*  And I actually like some of the stuff Luca did defensively where, you know, his
*  hands were on a lot of balls.
*  I thought he, he was jumping passes and he was picking pockets.
*  But in general, that's been a pretty good recipe in the past.
*  And I'm not sure Minnesota was fully equipped to do it.
*  OKC was a little better equipped.
*  Dow, the Clippers against them really tried to do it.
*  But do you feel like that's still sitting there for the Seltz?
*  It should be. This is the thing.
*  There was a quiet undercurrent of criticism of of Minnesota for not trying to put Luca
*  in more uncomfortable positions defensively.
*  Put some miles on.
*  The problem Minnesota had and has is who, who is going to do it.
*  It's only Anthony Edwards.
*  You have all every minute with Rudy Gobert on the floor means you're playing four on
*  five defense.
*  And and and that just creates too much leeway for for for Luca to not be in the
*  position where he's caught on an island.
*  And so I that Minnesota thing, this was the one vulnerability.
*  It was kind of the thing we circled at the beginning of the year.
*  Their half court offense was just not up to par to make it to the NBA finals, it
*  turns out, which is not that big of a criticism, really.
*  No, they had one other issue, too, that I can't believe we didn't fully think about
*  before that series, though they just didn't have any way they didn't have the right
*  guy to guard Luca.
*  And for some reason, I thought it was going to be McDaniel's.
*  And then you watch a half of one game and you're like, man, he's too small.
*  Look, it feels like he's got was almost like watching a tight end with a
*  cornerback on him, you know, or he just seemed it just I and that's one thing
*  that I feel really good with the Celtics.
*  I think they have real size to throw at him and he's going to get his he's going
*  to get to thirty nine and eleven every game.
*  I mean, that's when you're talking about bets game by game bets, which I know
*  we're going to go to after this break.
*  The Luca points, rebounds and assists all together, I think, is some of the
*  safest action, really the only way you're going to probably not hit those in
*  is in a blowout.
*  Yeah, because usually they're like in the forty seven forty eight range.
*  Right, so yeah, right in there.
*  Yeah, because he's about thirty one thirty two points.
*  So yeah, nine and eight.
*  Yeah, so that would be right.
*  Forty right up high forties there.
*  So yeah, I don't know.
*  I'm just excited about the entertainment factor with Luca and him complaining and
*  calling for I just honestly, do you guys think it should be a stat?
*  You know, you got the rebounds, assists, steals track of it.
*  How many challenges you've called for that were confirmed?
*  Like, don't you want to see that?
*  Like, LeBron LeBron would be the career leader.
*  LeBron, no one would touch LeBron.
*  I it'd be LeBron and Luca in the finals.
*  And then somebody random, there'd be some random bench player who who
*  like a Kelly who break or somebody.
*  It's a more it's a more devastating stat than I think like plus minus.
*  Like, look, when they go for a contract extension, like, hey, you cost us
*  14 challenges, you were minus 14 in challenge.
*  Let's let's let's we know people at Fandle.
*  Let's talk them in. This is the bitch bets.
*  Let's get some bitch bets going.
*  Yeah. How many how many, you know, the combination of bitches and calls
*  for a replay over under a per game, it's like, what is it?
*  Fourteen and a half.
*  The number of times Luca either bitches had a call or calls for a replay.
*  I'm setting that number of 14 and a half a minute.
*  I mean, it's definitely in the double digits, because right.
*  It might be a little high, but he has.
*  You feel like I got someone to the floor and complain.
*  No, you guys have because I saw it in person at the Quipper Games.
*  It's twice as many if you if you're watching.
*  Is it really? Oh, he's doing it after every play.
*  He really and I remember talking about it after one of the pods.
*  It's it's part of like his persona shtick thing with the refs.
*  He's relentless.
*  I've never seen a better player spend more time on this.
*  It's after every break.
*  Anytime somebody's shooting free throws, he's looking around.
*  He goes after whatever ref is the closest.
*  He's always like has his hands out like somebody that just like had his car
*  stolen and was trying to explain like, you don't understand.
*  My car was right there. It's gone.
*  And do a state farm.
*  That sounds like a good state farm.
*  I swear it works because you could tell these refs like, all right, fine.
*  Fuck it. All right. Fine. That was a charge.
*  Are you fine? I just please stop yelling at me.
*  And you know, you know, it's work is Draymond's rolling his eyes in the studio.
*  Oh, my. I even I would I honestly house.
*  I can't think of another player I've ever seen because some of the great players
*  did a lot like Bird did a lot of magic did a lot.
*  We don't know what Duncan at the end of his career did.
*  Duncan was good at it, but not like, you know, Dirk would work it every once in a while.
*  But not like this. This is this is constant.
*  He's putting like real pressure.
*  It's like he's blitzing the referees play after play, but it's really smart.
*  A couple couple of quick things for you
*  just to talk about the pressure on the Celtics team that I wanted to mention.
*  I think the Celtics have a real chance to be the king of the city,
*  which has only happened a couple of times this century.
*  Because mostly this happens because the other teams are bad.
*  The Red Sox started a lineup that had Bobby Dahlbach, seventh today,
*  who I think sitting 150 career, they're just by people are so out on them.
*  It's unbelievable.
*  The Bruins lost them round two again, and it feels like they're at the end
*  of some sort of air. The Patriots are rebuilding.
*  There were odds. My dad told me today about the Patriots have
*  the best odds to get the number one pick in 2025.
*  You can bet on it. And they're the favorite right now.
*  And the Celtics are just sitting there six out of the last eight conference finals.
*  Tatum is by far the most famous athlete in the city.
*  They have a chance to win a title.
*  So the only I went through the last 30 years, the only other times
*  where you could say a team was unquestionably king of the city.
*  The Patriots in 2015 after spot after the Flake Eight,
*  when they came back when the Malcolm Butler game
*  and it was like the Wingoed against the world.
*  And none of the other teams are doing that great that year.
*  So that was a good one.
*  The 99 Red Sox, everyone was terrible in the 96 Patriots.
*  But it's weird. The Boston teams have had so much success.
*  But now we're at this.
*  It's it's been five plus years since the last title
*  and the Celtics by far the I know I know houses making faces,
*  but the Celtics are by far the best chance.
*  No, we love this. This is great.
*  No, I knew you guys. I'm doing this just for a house because he has someone
*  is what you want a hockey title.
*  We in 2018 Stanley Cup 2019 series.
*  Stanley Cubs and World Series series still count.
*  House won a Super Bowl in 95.
*  Shut up. Shut up. Barely. Yeah.
*  You won. You won the 86 World Series.
*  So long. No, I think the cell.
*  What about the Sal drought? Jesus Christ.
*  It's been a long time.
*  You think the Celtics have like they told the other teams like a Red Sox
*  go start back start a quadruple a shortstop today because we need to
*  we need to be the.
*  No, I think I guarantee the Celtics are like this is great.
*  The craft Belichick thing blew up.
*  Yeah, craftspin maniac the whole off season.
*  The Red Sox made the worst trade in the last 75 years of the city.
*  And, you know, had this crap team and the Bruins have kind of, you know,
*  they're moving into whatever the next era for them is.
*  I'm sure they're delighted by.
*  Let me just say the only thing they have to win the title to cap it off.
*  Sure. The only thing they shared with would be the roast.
*  Like if the roast happened in July, that's the only competition, I think.
*  That's true. And the worst was great.
*  House just said something inappropriate because the other thing I have for you guys,
*  that whole best player in the finals usually wins the finals,
*  which is true for the most part.
*  LeBron and 14 and 11 didn't win Kobe and 08 and 04 didn't win Magic in 89.
*  Moses in 81.
*  And then you could go 2015 through 2019 and LeBron versus Curry,
*  Kawhi versus Curry, LeBron versus the Rand.
*  It's pretty hard. It's probably, um, you could argue both ways on it, but.
*  It is, it is fairly rare.
*  And I think Luca is the best player in this series.
*  So the question to me is, could Tatum rise at least in the vicinity?
*  Is that not going to be as good as Luca, but could he be in the vicinity?
*  House is making a face.
*  No, I like this because I didn't get the way in.
*  I adore that bet that you offered up a little while ago.
*  I absolutely love Celtics in six.
*  With Tatum MVP.
*  I love that bet.
*  And that means it's square. So everybody be careful out there.
*  That means it's square. But if I love it, then, then, then that's it.
*  But don't you think,
*  don't you think the best player on the court wins the title thing is going to
*  drift further and further from the norm as we see variants and you guys are
*  talking about variants all the time with three pointers.
*  So it might not even be the best player on the court's fault that he lost.
*  It's just that the threes are reigning up around him or her as it may be.
*  And, uh, they're either going in or missing at a horrific rate.
*  That's a great point because a three point variance B the league's just deeper.
*  Yeah.
*  And to have the best guy in a series,
*  I don't think means as much as it did in the mid two thousands when you had guys
*  playing major minutes in a rotation that probably weren't that good.
*  The guys now, like you look at, at both teams, like the top,
*  really it's a seven man rotation in the finals and then if anyone else plays up,
*  but the seven man rotations on these teams are really good. All right,
*  Sal, give us some bets you're looking at. Let's hear it. Let's go.
*  First of all, maybe I've talked too much about Jalen Brown here,
*  but if you don't like them for MVP, I like them for top score.
*  Plus seven 50 for one game. He'll get it for one game. So give it to me. Right.
*  So if you just keep betting them, this is for game one, you get them at plus seven.
*  So you take, you're saying take Jalen Brown every game, top score.
*  Plus seven 50. It's not going to go, it's not going to go eight games. Right.
*  So I think, you know, maybe it doesn't have a 40 in them,
*  but I think he will be the top score for a one of them. But I got to,
*  you want, should we wait house? What do you think of that one?
*  I'm fine with that. I like that one.
*  And it feels like it should happen in the first two games, to be honest with you.
*  It feels like it's a cash in game one or game two in the way that now did
*  Tatum outscore him in game one of the Pacers game because of how well Tatum
*  played in that overtime. So he ended up jumping over Jalen.
*  I mean, I said this on the bottom. I said this to Rosillo,
*  if you just talk to any basketball fan,
*  they would think Kyrie has better scoring stats than Jalen Brown.
*  It's just not true. The last four years, like Jalen's playoffs,
*  stats are better. His stats are better this year,
*  it's averaging 25 a game in the playoffs, um, which is up from,
*  he was like a 22, 23 a game guy, but he's just better this year. Like he's,
*  he has a power game that he didn't really totally have the last couple of years.
*  He doesn't lose the ball in traffic like he used to. And, uh, and he's just,
*  I just, the best he's ever played. So I like that one. So what else do you got?
*  Thank you. Uh, how about this? Derek Lively, most rebounds in the series.
*  Now I know he's not favored by any means. Tatum's probably going to win that,
*  but he had 53 in his last five full games.
*  Now people stop hitting them in the fricking head so much, like dropping them,
*  like swing them around. Like a six year old, fewer head hunters,
*  I think on the Celtics 12 to one seems too high for, um, for most rebounds.
*  I like that because I think we're going to see more of him than Gafford in this
*  series because of, uh, the Celtics being able to play the five out. Yeah.
*  I did that rebound bet a few times in these playoffs and I would always text
*  them and yolkage was money.
*  But then in the Oklahoma Dallas series,
*  I had Chet Holmgren who I think finished like seventh. Yeah.
*  He was in the running for my worst bet of 2024. Yeah.
*  Betting against the chiefs with Lamar Jackson was probably still my number one,
*  being convinced that they were going to win. What else he got? So I got one more,
*  big one, Derek white, most threes. We talked about him earlier. Plus three 30.
*  He said two or more in eight of his last 10. He's taking a lot too.
*  He averages eight and a half attempts over the last five. Um,
*  and not many close to that.
*  But when you look at attempts at seven and one game against the Cavs,
*  he had four a few times in the playoffs overall, I think plus three 30,
*  it's a nice number for him.
*  You have any house that you love?
*  Just so I, um, interestingly enough, had circled Derek white.
*  He's available on the Fandel sports book at minus one 13.
*  It's both sides of this, um,
*  prop for him to average 14 and a half points per game.
*  I think that's an awesome number in the series for the series 14 and a half,
*  minus one 13, the over and the under are the price. The same as minus one 13.
*  I love the over because I do think usage wise,
*  he is going to get a ton of touches, a ton of looks.
*  And I just, that guy is a guy that I trust.
*  Like I believe in him in the big moments converting those, those,
*  those touches. Um, and you know,
*  this is the thing that that when we're trying to slice and dice the outcome of
*  this finals very quietly,
*  Derek white and drew holiday are going to control the outcome of this to me,
*  to me. That's the way.
*  That's why I thought your argument about true holiday is the potential MVP for
*  the Pacers. I totally agree with that. That, that Pacer series, true holiday,
*  what he did in the dirty work in the behind the scenes work.
*  That's really what changed the trajectory of that. Now they did sweep them,
*  but still I thought holiday was, um, was awesome for that.
*  That was a hard one to figure out that award.
*  And we should remember that for the conference finals next year,
*  cause I left the series and I, I, I would have voted for drew,
*  but I thought it was going to be drew Jalen. And then the, as Sal pointed out,
*  it was Jalen five votes, Tatum four drew zero. And I thought,
*  I thought drew had like such a monster impact and he's such an amazing player
*  for a series like this. Cause not only can he guard Kyrie,
*  but he can guard Luca a little bit too.
*  And he's just jumping around and he just felt,
*  yeah, I absolutely love having these two guys in the team.
*  That's another thing that makes me think,
*  are they really going to lose the finals with this cool team they have?
*  We're with like these two forwards and they're seven years old.
*  These two forwards close to their prime and these two awesome guards and these
*  centers that can shoot. It's like, God, we're thinking of.
*  How about, yeah, maybe I know. And then they can try again next year.
*  I know it's the whole team.
*  We'll be setting myself up for real sadness. Um,
*  I have one that I really like.
*  So and it's, it's two actually.
*  And I like one more than the other, but I kind of like them both.
*  Luca for the series is 30 and a half points a game.
*  And I think that's too low because especially if you look at finals,
*  history of great players in the finals and guys that have the ball a lot,
*  the stats always go up, not down because the minutes go up and they're going to
*  be able to have, you know, especially in the first three games where it's.
*  Thursday, Sunday, Wednesday,
*  they're just going to be able to play him like 43,
*  44 minutes and not have to worry about it.
*  And then same thing when you get to game five, game six, seven, seven,
*  you have the same bumper. So him just averaging 31 a game, you know,
*  he's going to like, one of the reasons I think Celtics in six,
*  you know, he's going to have the one game where he just destroys them, right?
*  Where he has like 49 points, some crazy. So let's,
*  let's give them like a 47 point game or 45. Let's give them 45.
*  Let's be conservative. He is one awesome game.
*  And it's a six game series and you would have to score according to this,
*  185 points in the six games.
*  So if I'm taking 45 out and he's got to go 145 games for the rest of it,
*  it's 28 a game. Like he's going to get that. So
*  I think the only thing to worry about there as a proponent of the minus nine
*  and a half is a blowout with 10 minutes left in the fourth quarter and they
*  want to arrest them. That's the only thing. Otherwise you're good.
*  And then the other one is Kyrie, which I like just as much.
*  I think Kyrie under 23 and a half because his playoff history,
*  we're talking a 39 game sample size the last four years and he's 22 game.
*  He had a big series against Minnesota,
*  but that was also a great matchup for him, especially with how they're guarding.
*  I think the Celtics are going to be way more determined not to have him score,
*  right? And they're going to be hunting them on defense, trying to put miles on him.
*  And that just, that jumped at it to me is a tiny bit too high.
*  I also liked the Jalen Brown 23 and a half,
*  I think his love cause they're going to need him and he's just been a,
*  he's the 25 point a game guy house. So I would take those three.
*  And I thought you go two for three on those. Yeah. Okay. Great. I'm,
*  I support that. I don't like it when we go, when we're all doing.
*  The dog just showed up in the frame.
*  Well, he's an underdog.
*  Is that underdog a bad sign that we just had a dog?
*  We had three overs and only one under. I want to go down.
*  I want to do some more unders. That's, that's the lesson that we've learned.
*  Not enough wonders yet to be careful out there.
*  So Sal, did you like white 14.5 over you like that? Yeah. I mean, yeah.
*  If I like them for threes all over the place, I like half to like white 14 and a half.
*  But yeah, I do caution. Like they do try to suck into like a lot of these overs.
*  So if you think they're going to be some defensive games,
*  we're going to be in a little bit of trouble.
*  Maybe in the top points score for the series,
*  Luca at minus one 80 Tatum at plus two 60.
*  I actually thought Luca was going to be like three to one.
*  Cause Tatum Tatum's been so unselfish this year,
*  like 30 points is a lot of work for him.
*  That that means something else is going wrong with the team.
*  That price feels right to me and I wouldn't mess with it. There's no reason.
*  Does that stay away from you? No, I think you should do it on it.
*  This is as good an emotional hedge, I think, as you can get,
*  because you could have Luca be the top scorer and the Celtics could still win
*  the title. And then I told you so was all over the place.
*  Like threading the needle, like, like how said,
*  and when the hashtag and everything, I can't do emotional hedges with this
*  series. I have, I'm going to be with my dad.
*  You really can't. You're so invested already. I just don't understand it.
*  This is my dad's, this is my dad's 10th finals.
*  First one was 1974. He's 51 years later. He's back.
*  We weren't sure after last year what the hell was going to happen with this team.
*  And now this is that we've,
*  we've won one title with the Celtics since 86.
*  I know house does want to hear it because he's has once in 78, but.
*  Well, what's the record? What stocks records are they five and four?
*  What are they going into this 10th finals?
*  No, he won in 74, 76, 81, 84.
*  We started at four and oh lost an 85 and 87.
*  Six and three, one in 2008, lost 10,
*  lost in 22. Okay. So what's that? Six and three.
*  I think six and three, six and four, five and four, five and four, one of the other.
*  Yeah. I wish, I wish any of us could count. Anyway, it's,
*  it's this 10th one. You know, another thing about this series, the,
*  the tickets are like impossible because when they had the 22,
*  there was like post COVID some of the season ticket holders like sold their
*  tickets back. And in general,
*  some people are afraid to be in arenas. And so the prices,
*  even though it's the Warriors, right? That I had this one is like fucking crazy.
*  And you know what? I'll make some calls for you, pal. You've done enough for me.
*  I'll see if I can get you. I'll get you into one of these games.
*  Can I do a fake bet? Can we go to the riverboat casino? Yeah, let's do it.
*  Where are we going?
*  Will Mark Cuban be courtside for game one and game two of the finals?
*  Would you put for odds in that he's been on bench for all these games?
*  I think it's pretty even. No, I think he will be. I think it'll be courtside.
*  Minus two four.
*  What's what are we saying?
*  Courtside versus being in that sort of bench section where he is,
*  where he's very prominently featured. The camera finds him every time.
*  What are we doing? He's like going to be sitting like courtside,
*  like on the court.
*  Is he going to be where,
*  be where he normally is or because he doesn't own the team anymore and because
*  it's the finals that he moved to a different area where he's a little less
*  prominent. He gets to be in his spot. He's in the normal Mark Cuban.
*  So you're going same prominent kind of TV time for Cuban.
*  Yeah. Along with the bench. He's like cheering with the bench guys.
*  Sal, you agree with that? Yeah, I think so. I think he's right there.
*  So what would you put like minus 140?
*  I thought it was going to be a little higher, but.
*  Or like minus 180. I'm going the other way. I think, I think he's.
*  Really? Yeah.
*  I thought that Dallas celebration was really interesting when the new guy took
*  the trophy. Cuban was not on the podium.
*  And I think when we get to the finals, I just,
*  my spidey senses are telling me cubes is kind of getting pushed to the side.
*  They're like, oh yeah, you're still going to. And now it's like,
*  now we own the team. We see this happen in football all the time, right?
*  Yeah, that's true.
*  It's one of many things.
*  Who do you think is the biggest Boston sled that's going to be at this game?
*  Uh, serious. Uh, your dad check.
*  Your dad will be one. Um, check.
*  I'll check show up there. Do we get Aflecker Damon?
*  A hundred percent. Yes. I'm going to say. Yeah.
*  Are the both, are they both bigger than, uh, um,
*  Marky Mark. Yeah. Aflecker Damon are the biggest. That's bigger than Wahlberg.
*  They're the biggest. There are Nicholson's basically.
*  You'll be arms distance from them, right? You'll all be in the same section.
*  Don't you think? I'm with my dad. I'm in the same,
*  same seats he's had this whole time. My dad, retired superintendents,
*  still cranking along and row forward.
*  Will Bill Walton be mentioned in the post series, uh, you know,
*  interview right there on the court.
*  On the podium. No question. Well,
*  that's the other thing is they got to do like a really cool thing for him before
*  the game. And he's an absolutely beloved, beloved Celtic. Right.
*  And also considered himself a Celtic. Like he would call the Celtics and say,
*  it's Bill Walton, class of 1986. Like that's like,
*  that's how much he was drinking the Celtic Kool-Aid. So yeah,
*  I think they're going to do something pretty great for them.
*  What do you think for a star spangled banner? That's not going to be,
*  we won't have any of those, right? I don't know. I wish they did have,
*  I wish it was a bigger deal. They had a week to figure this out.
*  Can we get the new kids for one of these? Oh, that would be good.
*  That'd be pretty good. Yeah. I wouldn't,
*  not new kids over Aerosmith though. Right.
*  All right. So we're all taking Celtics and six.
*  We all have Celtics and six. I did have a question for you.
*  I'm bummed that you don't have an MVP vote for this. Um,
*  is this one of those things they'll like ask you five minutes before? Like,
*  Hey, we need your vote. Like, didn't they do that with you?
*  I shouldn't be allowed to have a, when the Celtics are involved,
*  I should not have a vote. I know, but this, it is like the beat reporters.
*  I know they do have anyway, the fact you, you have an MVP vote.
*  Is that your most cherished possession in the world?
*  Don't say your wife and kids, cause that's bullshit.
*  It's your wife and kids. Now, uh,
*  no, that's a pretty good one,
*  but there's a lot of responsibility with it now with the all MBA with like the
*  price bumps, like Tyrese Halliburton,
*  it's a $30 million difference if you vote for him or not vote for him.
*  I don't know. There's more, it's less fun than it used to be.
*  But if they took that away and they took your, I'd be furious.
*  You have a Jordan rookie card, which whatever you could just,
*  the Jordan rookie card. It's a safe deposit box. Yeah.
*  I have some good cards.
*  You can't get this vote back. All right.
